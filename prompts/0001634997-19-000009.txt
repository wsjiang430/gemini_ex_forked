Overview
AVANGRID is a leading sustainable energy company with approximately $32 billion in assets and operations in 24 states. AVANGRID has two primary lines of business - Avangrid Networks and Avangrid Renewables. Avangrid Networks owns eight electric and natural gas utilities, serving approximately 3.2 million customers in New York and New England. Avangrid Renewables owns and operates 7.2 gigawatts of electricity capacity, primarily through wind power, with a presence in 22 states across the United States. AVANGRID supports the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals approved by the member states of the United Nations, and earned the Compliance Leader Verification certification from the Ethisphere Institute, a third party verification of its ethics and compliance program. AVANGRID employs approximately 6,500 people. Iberdrola S.A., a corporation (sociedad anónima) organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain, a worldwide leader in the energy industry, directly owns 81.5% of outstanding shares of AVANGRID common stock. AVANGRID'S primary business is ownership of its operating businesses, which are described below.
Our direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries include Avangrid Networks, Inc., or Networks, and Avangrid Renewables Holdings, Inc., or ARHI. ARHI in turn holds subsidiaries including Avangrid Renewables, LLC, or Renewables. Networks owns and operates our regulated utility businesses through its subsidiaries, including electric transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales. Renewables operates a portfolio of renewable energy generation facilities primarily using onshore wind power and also solar, biomass and thermal power. The following chart depicts our current organizational structure.
Through Networks, we own electric generation, transmission and distribution companies and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales companies in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, delivering electricity to approximately 2.2 million electric utility customers and delivering natural gas to approximately 1.0 million natural gas public utility customers as of December 31, 2018. The interstate transmission and wholesale sale of electricity by these regulated utilities is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, under the Federal Power Act, or FPA, including with respect to transmission rates. Further, Networks’ electric and gas distribution utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts are subject to regulation by the New York State Public Service Commission, or NYPSC, the Maine Public Utilities Commission, or MPUC, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, or DPU, respectively. Networks strives to be a leader in safety, reliability and quality of service to its utility customers.
Through Renewables, we had a combined wind, solar and thermal installed capacity of 7,218 megawatts, or MW, as of December 31, 2018, including Renewables’ share of joint projects, of which 6,466 MW were installed wind capacity. Approximately 71% of the capacity was contracted as of December 31, 2018, for an average period of 8.5 years. Being among the top three largest wind operators in the United States based on installed capacity as of December 31, 2018, Renewables strives to lead the transformation of the U.S. energy industry to a sustainable, competitive, clean energy future. Renewables currently operates 57 wind farms in 21 states across the United States.
In December 2017, our management committed to a plan to sell the gas storage and trading businesses because they represented non-core businesses that are not aligned with our strategic objectives. At that time, we determined that the assets and liabilities associated with our gas trading and storage businesses met the criteria for classification as assets held for sale, but did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. On March 1, 2018, the Company closed a transaction to sell 
6

Enstor Energy Services, LLC, which operated AVANGRID’s gas trading business, to CCI U.S. Asset Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Castleton Commodities International, LLC. On May 1, 2018, the Company closed a transaction to sell Enstor Gas, LLC, which operated AVANGRID’s gas storage business, to Amphora Gas Storage USA, LLC. The agreement included, among other things, a transition services agreement that obligates ARHI to provide certain transition services for up to one year after the closing date. Additional details on held for sale classification are provided in Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Further information regarding the amount of revenues from external customers, including revenues by products and services, a measure of profit or loss and total assets for each segment for each of the last three fiscal years is provided in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

History
We were incorporated in 1997 as a New York corporation under the name NGE Resources, Inc. and subsequently changed our name to Energy East Corporation. The stock of Energy East Corporation was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE. In 2007, Iberdrola, S.A. acquired Scottish Power Ltd., or Scottish Power, including ScottishPower Holdings, Inc., or SPHI, the parent company of Scottish Power’s U.S. subsidiaries. Through this acquisition, Iberdrola, S.A. acquired PPM Energy, a subsidiary that operated SPHI’s U.S. wind business, thermal generation operations and the gas storage and energy management businesses and changed PPM Energy’s name to Iberdrola Renewables. In 2008, Iberdrola, S.A. acquired Energy East Corporation, and we changed our name to Iberdrola USA, Inc. in December 2009. In 2013, we completed an internal corporate reorganization to create a unified corporate presence for the Iberdrola brand in the United States, bringing all of its U.S. energy companies under one single holding company, Iberdrola USA, Inc. The internal reorganization, completed in November 2013, resulted in the concentration of our principal businesses in two major subsidiaries: Networks, which held all of our regulated utilities; and Renewables, which held our renewable and thermal generation businesses, and gas storage and marketing businesses.
We were the corporate parent of The Southern Connecticut Gas Company, or SCG, Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation, or CNG and The Berkshire Gas Company, or BGC, prior to UIL Holdings Corporation, or UIL, acquiring those companies in 2010.
On December 16, 2015, we completed the acquisition of UIL, pursuant to which UIL merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. The acquisition was effected pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 25, 2015, or the Merger Agreement, by and among us, Merger Sub and UIL. Following the completion of the acquisition, Merger Sub was renamed “UIL Holdings Corporation” and we were renamed Avangrid, Inc. Immediately following the completion of the acquisition, former UIL shareowners owned 18.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock of AVANGRID, and Iberdrola, S.A. owned the remaining shares. Effective as of April 30, 2016, UIL and its subsidiaries were transferred to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Networks.
Networks
Overview
Networks, a Maine corporation, holds our regulated utility businesses, including electric generation, transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales. Networks serves as a super-regional energy services and delivery company through the eight regulated utilities it owns directly:

• | New York State Electric & Gas Corporation, or NYSEG, which serves electric and natural gas customers across more than 40% of the upstate New York geographic area;


• | Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, or RG&E, which serves electric and natural gas customers within a nine-county region in western New York, centered around Rochester;


• | The United Illuminating Company, or UI, which serves electric customers in southwestern Connecticut;


• | Central Maine Power Company, or CMP, which serves electric customers in central and southern Maine;


• | SCG, which serves natural gas customers in Connecticut;


• | CNG, which serves natural gas customers in Connecticut;


• | BGC, which serves natural gas customers in western Massachusetts; and


• | Maine Natural Gas Corporation, or MNG, which serves natural gas customers in several communities in central and southern Maine.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, Networks distributed approximately 37.3 million megawatt-hours, or MWh, of electricity. As of December 31, 2018, Networks provided electric service to its approximately 2.2 million customers in the states of New York, Maine and Connecticut. In total, the electric system of Networks’ regulated utilities consisted of 8,662 miles of 
7

transmission lines, 70,653 miles of distribution lines and 821 substations as of December 31, 2018. Furthermore, for the year ended December 31, 2018, Networks delivered approximately 203 million dekatherms, or DTh, of natural gas, to approximately 1 million customers, providing service in the states of New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts.
The demand for electric power and natural gas is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. Demand for electricity in each of the states in which Networks operates tends to increase during the summer months to meet cooling load or in winter months for heating load while statewide demand for natural gas tends to increase during the winter to meet heating load.
The following table sets forth certain information relating to the rate base, number of customers and the amount of electricity or natural gas provided by each of Networks’ regulated utilities as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018:

(1) | “Rate base” means the net assets upon which a utility can receive a specified return, based on the value of such assets. The rate base is set by the relevant regulatory authority and typically represents the value of specified property, such as plants, facilities and other investments of the utility. These rate base values have been calculated using the best estimates as of December 31, 2018.

During the last five years, Networks has invested nearly $5.9 billion in creating a delivery network with greater capacity and improved reliability, environmental security and sustainability, efficiency and automation. Networks continuously improves its grid to accommodate new requirements for advanced metering, demand response and enhanced outage management, while improving its flexibility for the integration and management of distributed energy resources, or DER.
New York
As of December 31, 2018, NYSEG served approximately 899,000 electricity customers and 268,000 natural gas customers across more than 40% of upstate New York’s geographic area, while RG&E served approximately 381,000 electricity customers and 316,000 natural gas customers in a nine-county region centered around Rochester, in western New York.
In 2018, the nine hydroelectric plants owned by NYSEG and RG&E generated approximately 267 million kilowatt-hours, or kWh, of clean hydropower, which is enough energy to power 37,100 homes across New York State, assuming an average electricity consumption of 600 kWh per month per customer. See “—Properties—Networks” for more information regarding Networks’ electric generation plants.
Networks also holds an approximate 20% ownership interest in the regulated New York TransCo, LLC, or New York TransCo. Through New York TransCo, Networks has formed a partnership with Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation, Consolidated Edison, Inc., National Grid, plc, and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. to develop a portfolio of interconnected transmission lines and substations to fulfill the objectives of the New York energy highway initiative, a proposal to install up to 3,200 MW of new electric generation and transmission capacity in order to deliver more power generated from upstate New York power plants to downstate New York.
Maine
As of December 31, 2018, CMP delivered electricity to more than 627,000 customers in an 11,000 square-mile service area in central and southern Maine. CMP completed a $1.4 billion investment plan for the construction of upgrades to the bulk power transmission grid in Maine, the largest transmission investment in the history of Maine, which included the construction of five new 345-kilovolt, or kV, substations and related facilities linked by approximately 440 miles of new transmission lines (refers to the Maine Power Reliability Program, or MPRP).
CMP also owns 78% of the Maine Electric Power Corporation, or MEPCO, a single-asset 182-mile 345kV electric transmission line from the Maine/New Brunswick border to Wiscasset, Maine.

As of December 31, 2018, MNG delivers natural gas to 4,803 customers in central and southern Maine. MNG continues to build out in 12 communities.  
On February 14, 2018, the New England Clean Energy Connect, or NECEC, transmission project, proposed in a joint bid by CMP and Hydro-Québec, was selected by the Massachusetts electric utilities and the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, or DOER, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’s 83D clean energy Request for Proposal, or RFP, to move forward as the alternative to the Northern Pass Transmission project which failed to win approval from the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee by March 27, 2018. On March 28, 2018, the DOER informed CMP that the conditional selection of Northern Pass Transmission project had been terminated, making the NECEC transmission project the lone winning bid in the RFP. The proposed NECEC transmission project includes a 145-mile transmission line linking the electrical grids in Québec, Canada and New England. The project, which has an estimated cost of approximately $950 million, would add 1,200 MW of transmission capacity to supply New England with power from reliable hydroelectric generation.
On June 13, 2018, CMP entered into transmission service agreements, or TSAs, with the purchasing Massachusetts electric distribution companies, or the EDCs, and H.Q. Energy Services (U.S.) Inc., or HQUS, an affiliate of Hydro-Québec, which govern the terms of service and revenue recovery for the NECEC transmission project. Simultaneous with the execution of the TSAs with CMP, the EDCs have executed certain PPAs with HQUS for sales of electricity and environmental attributes to the EDCs. The EDCs submitted the TSAs and PPAs to the DPU for approval on July 23, 2018, and CMP filed the TSAs for approval by the FERC on August 20, 2018. On October 19, 2018, FERC issued an order accepting the TSAs for filing as CMP rate schedules effective as of October 20, 2018. The DPU proceedings are ongoing with a decision from the agency expected in the second quarter of 2019.
The NECEC project also requires certain permits, including environmental, from multiple state and federal agencies and a presidential permit from the U.S. Department of Energy, authorizing the construction, operation, maintenance and connection of facilities for the transmission of electric energy at the international border between the United States and Canada. These permitting activities are ongoing. CMP expects to obtain the applicable state and federal permits by year end 2019. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further details.
Connecticut
As of December 31, 2018, UI served more than 336,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in a service area of approximately 335 square miles in the southwestern part of Connecticut. The service area includes Bridgeport and New Haven and is home to a diverse array of business sectors including aerospace manufacturing, healthcare, biotech, financial services, precision manufacturing, retail and education. UI’s retail electric revenues vary by season, with the highest revenues typically in the third quarter of the year reflecting seasonal rates, hotter weather and air conditioning use.
UI is also a party to a joint venture with Clearway Energy, Inc. (formerly NRG Yield, Inc.), which is an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners, or GIP, pursuant to which UI holds 50% of the membership interests in GCE Holding LLC, whose wholly owned subsidiary, GenConn Energy LLC, or GenConn, operates peaking generation plants in Devon, Connecticut, or GenConn Devon, and Middletown, Connecticut, or GenConn Middletown. In September 2018, NRG Energy, Inc. sold its interests in NRG Yield, Inc. to GIP. The sale is not expected to have an impact on GenConn.
As of December 31, 2018, SCG and CNG provided local gas distribution services to approximately 377,000 customers in the greater Hartford-New Britain area, Greenwich and the southern Connecticut coast from Westport to Old Saybrook, including the cities of Bridgeport and New Haven.
Massachusetts

Earnings Sharing Mechanisms
Networks’ regulated utilities’ rate plans approved by State regulators often include earnings sharing mechanisms, or ESM, that are intended to encourage regulated utilities to operate efficiently. Pursuant to ESMs, if certain of the regulated utilities of Networks earn more than certain threshold amounts, they must share with customers a specified percentage of these earnings. Below is a history of ESMs over the past three years:

 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 
NYSEG Electric | 50% / 50%: 9.50% - 10.00%75% / 25%: 10.00% - 10.50%90% / 10%: over 10.50%;Based on Actual Equity Ratioup to 50% * | 50% / 50%: 9.65% - 10.15%75% / 25%: 10.15% - 10.65%90% / 10%: over 10.65%;Based on Actual Equity Ratioup to 50% | 50% / 50%: 9.75% - 10.25%75% / 25%: 10.25% - 10.75%90% / 10%: over 10.75%;Based on Actual Equity Ratioup to 50%

Renewables
The Renewables business, based in Portland, Oregon, is engaged primarily in the design, development, construction, management and operation of generation plants that produce electricity using renewable resources and, with more than 60 renewable energy projects, is one of the leaders in renewable energy production in the United States based on installed capacity. Renewables’ 
10

primary business is onshore wind energy generation, which represented approximately 90% of Renewables’ combined installed capacity as of December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Renewables produced approximately 16,207,000 MWh of energy through wind power generation. Renewables had a pipeline of approximately 14,000 MW (approximately 10,000 MW - onshore and approximately 4,000 MW - offshore) of future renewable energy projects in various stages of development as of December 31, 2018.
Typically, Renewables enters into long-term lease agreements with property owners who lease their land for renewable projects. Electricity generated at a wind project is then transmitted to customers through long-term agreements with purchasers. There are a limited number of turbine suppliers in the market. Renewables’ largest turbine suppliers, Siemens-Gamesa, in which Iberdrola has an 8.1% ownership, and GE Wind, in the aggregate supplied turbines which accounted for 74% of Renewables’ installed wind capacity as of December 31, 2018. 
Renewables currently operates 57 wind farms in 21 states across the United States. To monetize the tax benefits resulting from production tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation available to qualifying wind energy projects, Renewables has entered into “tax equity” financing structures with third party investors for a portion of its wind farms. Renewables holds nine operating wind farms under these structures through limited liability companies jointly owned by one or more third party investors. These investors generally provide an up-front investment or, in some cases, payments over time for their membership interests in the financing structures. In return, the investors receive specified cash distribution allocations and substantially all of the tax earnings and benefits generated by the wind farms, until such benefits achieve a negotiated return on their investment. Upon attainment of this target return, the sharing of the cash flows and tax benefits flip, with Renewables receiving substantially all of these amounts thereafter. We also have an option to repurchase the investor’s interest within a certain timeframe after the target return is met. Renewables maintains operational and management control over the wind farm businesses, subject to investor approval of certain major decisions. See “—Properties—Renewables” for more information regarding Renewables’ wind power generation properties.
Additionally, as part of the Renewables portfolio, Renewables operates two thermal generation facilities in the United States, with 636 MW of combined capacity as of December 31, 2018. Renewables worked closely with the City of Klamath Falls, Oregon to develop the Klamath Plant, which has a current capacity of 536 MW. The Klamath Plant operates by creating two useful forms of energy, electricity and process steam, from a single fuel source of natural gas. In addition, Renewables operates a highly flexible 100 MW Klamath Peaking Plant adjacent to the Klamath Plant, providing customers of Renewables additional capability to meet their peak summer and winter power needs.
In addition to its wind assets, Renewables operates four solar photovoltaic facilities with an installed capacity of 116 MW. The solar photovoltaic facilities produced over 262,000 MWh of renewable energy for the year ended December 31, 2018. Solar accounted for 1.5% of the total renewable energy generation from Renewables in these same periods.
Renewables is pursuing the continued development of a large pipeline of wind energy projects in various regions across the United States. Each site features a range of different atmospheric characteristics that ultimately drive the selection of turbine technology for the proposed project. As part of Renewables’ wind resource assessment investigation, critical atmospheric parameters such as mean wind speed, extreme wind speed, turbulence intensity, and mean air density are characterized to represent long-term conditions, for over 20 years. The summary wind characteristics are then combined with a terrain, or orography, analysis to assess siting risks in order to mitigate any future operations and maintenance concerns that may arise due to improper turbine siting.
Renewables maintains close relationships with key turbine suppliers, including Siemens-Gamesa, GE, Vestas and others in order to identify the turbine technology that safely delivers the lowest cost of energy for each candidate project in its portfolio. Renewables has deployed the following mix of turbines under this strategy. See “—Properties—Renewables” for more information regarding Renewables’ turbine technology.

The Renewables meteorology team supports the commercial development of wind energy projects in Renewables’ pipeline by performing a wide variety of detailed investigations to characterize the expected wind energy production from a proposed wind farm in its pre-construction phase of development. These investigations include measuring the wind resource with several well-equipped meteorological masts, utilizing state of the art laser-based and acoustic-based remote sensing equipment, computational fluid dynamics modeling software and energy modeling software packages that characterize wake losses from any upwind turbines that may be present. The Renewables fleet of measurement masts consists of approximately 170 towers that are currently in operation. Additionally, a total of six light detecting and ranging, and six sonic detecting and ranging, remote sensing devices are deployed at sites across the United States. These remote sensing devices allow hub-height wind speed measurement from a ground-based sensor that can be rapidly deployed and moved as the project matures or changes in nature. The resulting pre-construction energy production estimates that utilize these measurements have been shown to be accurate in a multi-year internal study that compares results to actual, operational data in a benchmarking analysis. This study provides a critical feedback loop that is used to define methodology requirements for future pre-construction energy production estimates to ensure confidence in project investment. Renewables’ commitment to obtaining robust atmospheric measurement is driven by a company culture that values business case confidence and understands the role that accurate meteorological data play in the pursuit of this goal.
Regulatory Environment and Principal Markets
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
Among other things, the FERC regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. Certain aspects of Networks’ businesses and Renewables’ competitive generation businesses are subject to regulation by the FERC.
Pursuant to the FPA, electric utilities must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with the FERC, which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of the FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Unless otherwise exempt, any person that owns or operates facilities used for the wholesale sale or transmission of power in interstate commerce is a public utility subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. The FERC regulates, among other things, the disposition of certain utility property, the issuance of securities by public utilities, the rates, the terms and conditions for the transmission or wholesale sale of power in interstate commerce, interlocking officer and director positions, and the uniform system of accounts and reporting requirements for public utilities.
With respect to Networks’ regulated electric utilities in Maine, New York and Connecticut, the FERC governs the return on equity, or ROE, on all transmission assets in Maine and Connecticut and certain New York TransCo assets in New York; FERC also oversees the rates, terms and conditions of transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, interconnection service in interstate commerce (which applies to independent power generators, for example), and the rates, terms and conditions of wholesale sales of electric energy in interstate commerce, which includes cost-based rates, market-based rates and the operations of regional capacity and electric energy markets in New England administered by an independent entity, ISO New England, Inc., or ISO-NE, and in New York, administered by another independent entity, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., or NYISO. The FERC approves CMP, UI and New York TransCo regulated electric utilities’ transmission revenue requirements. Wholesale electric transmission revenues are recovered through formula rates that are approved by the FERC. CMP’s, MEPCO’s and UI’s electric 
12

transmission revenues are recovered from New England customers through charges that recover costs of transmission and other transmission-related services provided by all regional transmission owners. NYSEG’s and RG&E’s electric transmission revenues are recovered from New York customers through charges that recover the costs of transmission, and other transmission-related services provided by all transmission owners in New York. Several of our affiliates have been granted authority to engage in sales at market-based rates and blanket authority to issue securities, and have also been granted certain waivers of the FERC reporting and accounting regulations available to non-traditional public utilities; however, we cannot be assured that such authorizations or waivers will not be revoked for these affiliates or will be granted in the future to other affiliates.
Pursuant to a series of orders involving the ROE for regionally planned New England electric transmission projects, the FERC established a base-level transmission ROE of 11.14%, as well as providing a 50-basis point ROE adder on Pool Transmission Facilities, or PTF, for participation in the regional transmission organization, or RTO, for New England and a 100-basis point ROE incentive for projects included in the ISO-NE Regional System Plan that were completed and on line as of December 31, 2008. Certain other transmission projects received authorization for incentives up to 125 basis points.
Since 2011, several parties have filed four separate complaints with the FERC against ISO-NE and several New England transmission owners, or NETOs, including UI, CMP and MEPCO, claiming that the current approved base ROE of 11.14% was not just and reasonable, seeking a reduction of the base ROE and a refund to customers for the 15-month refund periods beginning October 1, 2011 (Complaint I), December 27, 2012 (Complaint II), July 31, 2014 (Complaint III) and April 29, 2016 (Complaint IV).
Following various intermediate hearings, orders, and appellate decisions, on October 16, 2018, the FERC issued an order directing briefs and proposing a new methodology to calculate the NETOs ROE that is contained in NETOs’ transmission formula rate on file at FERC, or the October 2018 Order. The FERC proposes to use this new methodology to resolve Complaints I, II, III, and IV filed by the New England state consumer advocates.
The new proposed ROE methodology set forth in the October 2018 Order considers more than just the two-step discounted cash flow, or DCF, analysis adopted in the FERC order on Complaint I vacated by the Court. The new proposed ROE methodology uses three financial analyses (i.e., DCF, the capital-asset pricing model, and the expected earnings analysis) to produce a range of returns to narrow the zone of reasonableness when assessing whether a complainant has met its initial burden of demonstrating that the utility’s existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable. The new proposed ROE methodology establishes a range of just and reasonable ROEs of 9.60% to 10.99% and proposes a just and reasonable base ROE of 10.41% with a new ROE cap of 13.08%. Pursuant to the October 2018 Order, the NETOs filed briefs on the proposed methodology in all four Complaints on January 11, 2019. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.
The FERC has the right to review books and records of “holding companies,” as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, or PUHCA 2005, that are determined by FERC to be relevant to the companies’ respective FERC-jurisdictional rates. We are a holding company, as defined in PUHCA 2005.
The FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1.3 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under Part II of the FPA. Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPAct 2005, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, has been certified by the FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization for North America responsible for developing and overseeing the enforcement of electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the United States. FERC-approved reliability standards may be enforced by the FERC independently, or, alternatively, by NERC and the regional reliability organizations with frontline responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to the FERC oversight.
The gas distribution operations of NYSEG, RG&E, SCG, CNG and BGC are subject to the FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, with respect to their gas purchases/sales and contracted transportation/storage capacity. FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for certain violations of up to $1.3 million per day for violations. FERC also has the authority to order the disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the NGA and EPAct 2005.
Market Anti-Manipulation Regulation
The FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market pursuant to the FPA, the Commodity Exchange Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, including our businesses’ energy transactions and operations in the United States. With regard to the physical purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas, the gathering storage, transmission and delivery of these energy commodities and any related trading or hedging transactions that some of our operating subsidiaries undertake, our operating subsidiaries are required to observe these anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced 
13

by the FERC and CFTC. The FERC and CFTC hold substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess civil penalties of up to $1.3 million per day per violation, to order disgorgement of profits and to recommend criminal penalties.
State Regulation
Networks’ regulated utilities are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commissions, including with regard to their rates, terms and conditions of service, issuance of securities, purchase or sale of utility assets and other accounting and operational matters. NYSEG and RG&E are subject to regulation by the NYPSC; CMP and MNG are subject to regulation by the MPUC; UI, SCG and CNG are subject to regulation by the PURA; and BGC is subject to regulation by the DPU. The NYPSC, MPUC and the Connecticut Siting Council, or CSC, exercise jurisdiction over the siting of electric transmission lines in their respective states, and each of the NYPSC, MPUC, PURA and DPU exercise jurisdiction over the approval of certain mergers or other business combinations involving Networks’ regulated utilities. In addition, each of the utility commissions has the authority to impose penalties on these regulated utilities, which could be substantial, for violating state utility laws and regulations and their orders.
Networks’ regulated distribution utilities deliver electricity and/or natural gas to all customers in their service territory at rates established under cost of service regulation. Under this regulatory structure, Networks’ regulated distribution utilities recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on its costs, and earn a return on their capital investment in utility assets.
The following provides a summary of Networks regulated utilities’ most recent rate cases:

• | New York. On May 20, 2015, NYSEG and RG&E initiated a distribution rate case to ensure that the companies are able to continue to provide safe, adequate and reliable service, continue to make investments to modernize infrastructure, enhance low income programs and improve both gas and electric reliability, while maintaining the Companies’ financial integrity. On February 19, 2016, NYSEG, RG&E and other signatory parties filed a Joint Proposal, with the NYPSC for a three-year rate plan for electric and gas service at NYSEG and RG&E commencing May 1, 2016. The Joint Proposal was approved on June 15, 2016 by the NYPSC. For more information on rate case activity in New York, see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

The NYSEG and RG&E 2016 three-year rate plan ends in April 2019. The companies intend to file rate cases in New York in the second quarter of 2019 for new tariffs effective in the second quarter of 2020.

• | Maine. On May 1, 2013, CMP filed a distribution service rate case in order to recover past and future investments and provide safe and adequate service. On August 25, 2014, MPUC approved a stipulation agreement that provided for a distribution rate increase of approximately $24.3 million, effective July 1, 2014, with an allowed ROE of 9.45% and an allowed equity ratio of 50%. The stipulation provided for the implementation of a revenue decoupling mechanism, or RDM, reserve accounting and sharing of incremental storm costs, a separate proceeding for recovery of a new billing system and no earnings sharing. On March 1, 2018, the MPUC issued a Notice of Investigation initiating a summary investigation into CMP’s metering, billing and customer communications practices. Due to the highly technical nature of CMP’s customer billing system, on March 22, 2018 the MPUC issued an Order Initiating Audit commencing a forensic audit of CMP’s customer billing system to identify any errors that have, or continue to be resulting in billing inaccuracies. On July 10, 2018, the MPUC issued an Order Modifying Scope of Audit, which expanded the scope of the audit to include the customer communication practices that were originally identified in the Commission’s Notice of Investigation. On May 29, 2018, a ten-person complaint was filed with the MPUC against CMP, Networks and AVANGRID. The complaint requested that the MPUC open a rate case to determine if CMP is making excessive returns on investment and, therefore, whether CMP’s retail rates should be lower. The complaint also requested the MPUC deny certain costs associated with the October 2017 windstorm. On July 24, 2018, the MPUC issued an order dismissing the complaint and its associated request to deny the recovery of costs associated with the October 2017 windstorm. The order initiated an investigation into CMP’s rates and revenue requirement and directed CMP to make a filing consistent with the requirements for a general rate case no later than October 15, 2018. Consistent with the order in the ten-person complaint proceeding, on August 7, 2018, the MPUC issued a Notice of Investigation, opening the proceeding in which CMP would make its rate case filing and through which the MPUC will examine the rates and revenue requirements of CMP. On October 15, 2018, CMP filed a general rate case as directed by the MPUC requesting a ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 55%. CMP is proposing to use savings arising out of changes in federal taxation pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, to keep its distribution prices stable while making its electric system more reliable. The MPUC has established a ten-month process to review CMP’s filing and we expect a decision in October of 2019. CMP’s general rate case filing includes a proposal to enhance the resiliency of the energy grid by expanding vegetation management and pursuing additional reliability measures such as pole replacements and addition of tree wire in selected areas. Such investments are designed to strengthen CMP’s power grid so it can better stand up to severe weather. CMP is planning to use savings from the

14

federal Tax Act to pay for the costs of resiliency programs, other investments in infrastructure and certain cost increases since 2014. On December 20, 2018, the MPUC released the findings of the forensic audit of CMP’s customer billing system and customer communication practices. On January 14, 2019, the MPUC issued an Order and Notice of Investigation initiating an investigation of CMP’s metering and billing practices and initiating a separate investigation of the audit of CMP’s customer service and communication practices and incorporating such investigation into the general rate case. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
On March 5, 2015, MNG filed a rate case in order to further recover future investments and provide safe and adequate service. On May 3, 2016, all active parties to the case filed a stipulation that settled all matters at issue in the case and reflected a 10-year rate plan through April 30, 2026. The MPUC approved the stipulation on May 17, 2016, for new rates effective June 1, 2016. The settlement structure for non-Augusta customers includes a 34.6% delivery revenue increase over five years with an allowed 9.55% ROE and 50% common equity ratio. The settlement structure for Augusta customers includes a ten-year rate plan with existing Augusta customers being charged rates equal to non-Augusta customers plus a surcharge that increases annually for five years. New Augusta customers will have rates set based on an alternate fuel market model. In year seven of the rate plan MNG will submit a cost of service filing for the Augusta area to determine if the rate plan should continue. This cost of service filing will exclude $15 million of initial 2012/2013 gross plant investment, however the stipulation allows for accelerated depreciation of these assets. If the Augusta area’s cost of service filing illustrates results above a 14.55% ROE then the rate plan may cease, otherwise the rate plan would continue. A disallowance for the initial 2012/2013 gross plant investment is not part of the approved stipulation.

• | Connecticut. In December 2016, PURA approved distribution rate schedules for UI for three years that became effective January 1, 2017 and which, among other things, provides for annual tariff increases and an ROE of 9.10% based on a 50% equity ratio, continued UI’s existing ESM pursuant to which UI and its customers share on a 50/50 basis all distribution earnings above the allowed ROE in a calendar year, continued the existing decoupling mechanism, and approved the continuation of a requested storm reserve. Any dollars due to customers from the ESM continue to be first applied against any storm regulatory asset balance (if one exists at that time) or refunded to customers through a bill credit if such storm regulatory asset balance does not exist.

In December 2017, PURA approved new tariffs for SCG effective January 1, 2018 for a three-year rate plan with rate increases of $1.5 million, $4.7 million and $5.0 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The new tariff also includes an RDM and Distribution Integrity Management Program, or DIMP, mechanism similar to the mechanisms authorized for CNG, ESM, the amortization of certain regulatory liabilities (most notably accumulated hardship deferral balances and certain accumulated deferred income taxes) and tariff increases based on a ROE of 9.25% and approximately 52% equity level. Any dollars due to customers from the ESM will be first applied against any environmental regulatory asset balance as defined in the settlement agreement (if one exists at that time) or refunded to customers through a bill credit if such environmental regulatory asset balance does not exist.
On June 29, 2018, CNG filed an application with PURA for new tariffs to become effective January 1, 2019. On August 30, 2018, CNG entered into a settlement agreement with the Office of Consumer Counsel and PURA prosecutorial staff that provides for new rates effective January 1, 2019. The settlement agreement was approved by PURA on December 19, 2018. The settlement agreement included an increase in rates of $9.9 million in 2019, an incremental increase of $4.6 million in 2020 and an incremental increase of $5.2 million in 2021, for a total increase of $19.7 million over the three-year rate plan. The settlement agreement is based on an ROE of 9.30%, and an equity ratio of 54% in 2019, 54.50% in 2020 and 55% in 2021.
For more information on rate case activity in Connecticut, see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

• | Massachusetts. BGC’s rates are established by the DPU. BGC’s ten-year rate plan, which was approved by the DPU and included an approved ROE of 10.5%, expired on January 31, 2012. BGC continues to charge the rates that were in effect at the end of the rate plan.

On May 17, 2018, BGC filed a petition with the DPU seeking approval of a distribution rate increase to be effective January 1, 2019. On December 4, 2018, BGC and the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office filed a settlement agreement with the DPU. The settlement agreement provides for a $1.6 million distribution base rate increase effective January 1, 2019, or February 1, 2019 if the DPU did not approve the settlement agreement prior to January 1, 2019, and an additional $0.7 million base distribution increase effective November 1, 2019, if certain investments are made by BGC. The settlement agreement contained a make-whole provision if the DPU approved the agreement after January 1, 2019. The distribution rate increase is based on a 9.70% ROE and 55% equity ratio. The settlement agreement provides for the implementation 
15

of a RDM and pension expense tracker and also provides that BGC will not file to change base distribution to become effective before November 1, 2021. The settlement agreement was approved by the DPU on January 18, 2019.
In addition, as a result of a restructuring of the utility industry in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, most of Networks’ distribution utilities’ customers have the opportunity to purchase their electricity or natural gas supplies from third-party energy supply vendors. Most customers in New York, however, continue to purchase such supplies through the distribution utilities under regulated energy rates and tariffs. In Maine, CMP customers can also purchase electric supply from competitive providers but the majority receives baseline standard offer service that is provided through a MPUC procurement process. Networks’ regulated utilities in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts and MNG purchase electricity or natural gas from unaffiliated wholesale suppliers and recover the actual approved costs of these supplies on a pass-through basis, as well as certain costs associated with industry restructuring, through reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted.
In April 2014, the NYPSC instituted its Reforming the Energy Vision, or REV, proceeding, the goals of which are to improve electric system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support DER, and empower customer choice. Within REV and its related proceedings, the NYPSC is examining the establishment of a Distributed System Platform, or DSP, to manage and coordinate DER, and to provide customers with market data and tools to manage their energy use. The NYPSC has determined distribution utilities should be the DSP providers. The NYPSC also is examining how its regulatory practices should be modified to incent utility practices to promote REV objectives. The REV-related proceedings involve a two-phased schedule with an initial order relating to policy determinations for DSP and related matters issued in February 2015 and an initial order for regulatory design and regulatory matters issued in May 2016. All electric utilities were ordered to file an initial Distributed System Implementation Plan, or DSIP, by June 30, 2016. An initial DSIP was filed by NYSEG and RG&E and included information regarding the potential deployment of Automated Metering Infrastructure, or AMI. A separate petition for the cost recovery associated with full deployment of AMI was filed by NYSEG and RG&E in December 2016. In March, 2017, the NYPSC issued three separate REV-related orders. These orders created a series of filing requirements for NYSEG and RG&E beginning in March 2017 and extending through the end of 2018. The three orders involve: 1) modifications to the electric utilities’ proposed interconnection earnings adjustment mechanism, or EAM, framework; 2) further DSIP requirements, including filing of an updated DSIP plan by mid-2018 and implementing two energy storage projects at each company by the end of 2018; and 3) Net Energy Metering Transition including implementation of Phase One of the Value of DER. In September 2017, the NYPSC issued another order related to the Value of DER, requiring tariff filings, changes to Standard Interconnection Requirements, and planning for the implementation of automated consolidated billing. In July 2018, NYSEG and RG&E submitted an updated DSIP plan consistent with guidance received from the NY Department of Public Service. As of the end of 2018, both NYSEG and RG&E had deployed two energy storage projects each, consistent with the March 2017 NYPSC order requirements. Phase Two of the Value of DER proceeding was established and several working group sessions occurred between the latter half of 2017 and all of 2018, primarily addressing issues pertaining to compensation for DER and rate design. In December 2018, the NYPSC Staff submitted whitepapers on standby and buyback service rate design, future value stack compensation and capacity value compensation. It is expected that the NYPSC will rule on the proposals set forth in the whitepapers in 2019. An additional staff whitepaper on Rate Design for Mass Market On-Site DER projects interconnected after January 1, 2020 is scheduled to be submitted by the NYPSC Staff in the first quarter of 2019.
State public utility commissions may also have jurisdiction over certain aspects of Renewables’ competitive generation businesses. For example, in New York, certain Renewables’ generation subsidiaries are electric corporations subject to “lightened” regulation by the NYPSC. As such, the NYPSC exercises its jurisdictional authority over certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including safety, retirements and the issuance of debt secured by recourse to those generation assets located in New York. In Texas, Renewables’ operations within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, footprint are not subject to regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT. In California, Renewables’ generation subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission with regard to certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including health and safety, outage reporting and other aspects of the facilities’ operations. 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, was signed into law. The Tax Act significantly changed the federal taxation of business entities including, among other things, implementing a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Reductions in accumulated deferred income tax balances due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rates will result in amounts previously and currently collected from utility customers for these deferred taxes to be refundable to such customers, generally through reductions in future rates. The NYPSC, MPUC, PURA, DPU and the FERC have instituted separate proceedings in New York, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts and the FERC, respectively, to review and address the implications of the Tax Act on the utilities. For more information on the Tax Act proceedings, see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
16

RTOs and ISOs
Networks’ regulated electric utilities in New York, Connecticut and Maine, as well as some of Renewables’ generation fleet, operate in or have access to organized energy markets, known as RTOs or independent system operators, or ISOs, particularly NYISO and ISO-NE. Each organized market administers centralized bid-based energy, capacity and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by the FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy, capacity and ancillary service markets operate, how market participants bid, clear, are dispatched, make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Certain of these markets set prices, referred to as Locational Marginal Prices that reflect the value of energy, capacity or certain ancillary services, based upon geographic locations, transmission constraints and other factors. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of market power. Some markets limit the prices of the bidder based upon some level of cost justification. These market structures impact the bidding, operation, dispatch and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services.
The RTOs and ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations within their respective regions. Each of Networks’ transmission-owning subsidiaries in New York, Connecticut and Maine has transferred operational control over certain of its electric transmission facilities to its respective ISOs, such as ISO-NE and NYISO.
New Renewable Source Generation
Under Connecticut Public Act 11-80, or PA, Connecticut electric utilities are required to enter into long-term contracts to purchase Connecticut Class I Renewable Energy Certificates, or RECs, from renewable generators located on customer premises. Under this program, UI is required to enter into contracts totaling approximately $200 million in commitments over approximately 21 years. The obligations will phase in over a six-year solicitation period, and are expected to peak at an annual commitment level of about $13.6 million per year after all selected projects are online. Upon purchase, UI accounts for the RECs as inventory. UI expects to partially mitigate the cost of these contracts through the resale of the RECs. PA 11-80 provides that the remaining costs (and any benefits) of these contracts, including any gain or loss resulting from the resale of the RECs, are fully recoverable from (or credited to) customers through electric rates. PA 17-144 and PA18-50 added seventh and eighth years and up to $48 million in additional commitments by UI to the program.
On October 23, 2013, PURA approved UI’s renewable connections program filed in accordance with PA 11-80, pursuant to which UI has developed 10 MW of renewable generation. The costs for this program will be recovered on a cost of service basis. PURA established a base ROE to be calculated as the greater of: (A) the current UI authorized distribution ROE (currently 9.10%) plus 25 basis points and (B) the current authorized distribution ROE for The Connecticut Light and Power Company, (currently 9.25%), less target equivalent market revenues (reflected as 25 basis points). In addition, UI will retain a percentage of the market revenues from the project, which percentage is expected to equate to approximately 25 basis points on a levelized basis over the life of the project. The cost of this program, a 2.8 MW fuel cell facility in New Haven, solar photovoltaic and fuel cell facilities totaling 5 MW in Bridgeport and a 2.2 MW fuel cell facility in Woodbridge, all of which are now operational, was $41.5 million.
Pursuant to Connecticut statute, in January 2017, UI entered into a master agreement with the Connecticut Green Bank to procure Connecticut Class I RECs produced by residential solar installations in 15-year tranches, with a final tranche to commence no later than 2022. UI’s contractual obligation is to procure 20% of RECs produced by about 255 MW of residential solar installations. Connecticut statutes provide that the net costs (and any benefits) of these contracts, including any gain or loss resulting from the resale of the RECs, are fully recoverable from (or credited to) customers through electric rates.
On May 25, 2017, UI entered into six 20-year power purchase agreements, or PPAs, totaling approximately 32 MW with developers of wind and solar generation. These PPAs originated from a three-state Clean Energy RFP, and were entered into pursuant to PA 13-303 which provides that the net costs of the PPAs are recoverable through electric rates. The PPAs were approved by PURA on September 13, 2017.
On June 20, 2017, UI entered into twenty-two 20-year PPAs totaling approximately 72 MW with developers of wind and solar generation. These PPAs originated from an RFP issued by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP, under PA 15-107 1(b), which provides that the net costs of the PPAs are recoverable through electric rates. The PPAs were approved by PURA on September 7, 2017. One contract was terminated on October 24, 2017, resulting in UI having twenty-one remaining contracts from this solicitation totaling approximately 70 MW.
In October of 2018, UI entered into five PPAs totaling approximately 50 MW from developers of offshore wind and fuel cell generation. These PPAs originated from an RFP issued by DEEP, under PA 17-144 which provides that the net costs of the PPAs are recoverable through electric rates. The PPAs were filed for PURA approval on October 25, 2018. On December 19, 2018, PURA issued its final decision approving the five PPAs and approved UI’s use of the non by-passable federally mandated congestion charges for all customers to recover the net costs of the PPAs.
17

On December 28, 2018, DEEP issued a directive to UI to negotiate and enter into PPAs with 12 projects, totaling approximately 12 million MWh, which were selected as a result of the Zero Carbon RFP issued by DEEP pursuant to PA 17-3, which provides that the net costs of the PPAs are recoverable through electric rates. One of the selected projects is the Millstone nuclear facility located in Waterford, Connecticut and owned by Dominion Energy, Inc. DEEP’s directive provides that UI should file these PPAs for PURA by March 31, 2019. UI has not yet entered into any of these PPAs.
Under Maine law 35-A M.R.S.A §§ 3210-C, 3210-D, the MPUC is authorized to conduct periodic RFPs seeking long-term supplies of energy, capacity or RECs, from qualifying resources. The MPUC is further authorized to order Maine transmission and distribution utilities to enter into contracts with sellers selected from the MPUC’s competitive solicitation process. Pursuant to a MPUC Order dated October 8, 2009, CMP entered into a 20-year agreement with Evergreen Wind Power III, LLC, on March 31, 2010, to purchase capacity and energy from Evergreen’s 60 MW Rollins wind farm in Penobscot County, Maine. CMP’s purchase obligations under the Rollins contract are approximately $7 million per year. In accordance with subsequent MPUC orders, CMP periodically auctions the purchased Rollins energy to wholesale buyers in the New England regional market. Under applicable law, CMP is assured recovery of any differences between power purchase costs and achieved market revenues through a reconcilable component of its retail distribution rates. Although the MPUC has conducted multiple requests for proposals under M.R.S.A §3210-C and has tentatively accepted long-term proposals from other sellers, these selections have not yet resulted in additional currently effective contracts with CMP.
Pursuant to Maine Law 35-A M.R.S.A §3604, the MPUC is authorized to direct Maine transmission and distribution utilities to enter into long-term contracts to purchase capacity, energy and renewable energy credits from up to 50 MW of qualifying Community-Based Renewable Energy facilities. In accordance with §3604, on October 22, 2016, CMP commenced purchases from Athens Energy LLC for a contract term of three years. CMP purchase obligations under the Athens contract are approximately $6 million per year. Under the provisions of §3604 and MPUC implementing orders, CMP will periodically auction the purchased products from Athens for resale to wholesale market purchasers and recover any differences between power purchase costs and resale revenues through a reconcilable component of its retail distribution rates. Although the MPUC has certified several additional Community - Based Renewable Energy generation projects under §3604 and authorized similar PPAs between these sellers and CMP, no additional facilities have advanced to operational status.
Environmental, Health and Safety
Permitting and Other Regulatory Requirements
Networks. Similar to Renewables, Networks’ distribution utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in connection with the environmental, health and safety effects of its operations. The distribution utilities of Networks are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commission with respect to the siting and approval of electric transmission lines, with the exception of UI, the siting of whose transmission lines is subject to the jurisdiction of the CSC, and with respect to pipeline safety regulations for intrastate gas pipeline operators.
The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, requires that detailed statements of the environmental effect of Networks’ facilities be prepared in connection with the issuance of various federal permits and licenses. Federal agencies are required by NEPA to make an independent environmental evaluation of the facilities as part of their actions during proceedings with respect to these permits and licenses.
Under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has issued regulations that control the use and disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyls, or PCBs. PCBs were widely used as insulating fluids in many electric utility transformers and capacitors manufactured before the federal Toxic Substances Control Act prohibited any further manufacture of such PCB equipment. Fluids with a concentration of PCBs higher than 500 parts per million and materials (such as electrical capacitors) that contain such fluids must be disposed of through burning in high temperature incinerators approved by the EPA. For our gas distribution companies, PCBs are sometimes found in the distribution system. Networks tests any distribution piping being removed or repaired for the presence of PCBs and complies with relevant disposal procedures, as needed.
Under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to regulations adopted by the EPA. All of Networks’ subsidiaries have complied with the notification and application requirements of present regulations, and the procedures by which the subsidiaries handle, store, treat and dispose of hazardous waste products comply with these regulations.
Prior to the last quarter of the 20th century, when environmental best practices laws and regulations were implemented, utility companies, including Networks’ subsidiaries, often disposed of residues from operations by depositing or burying them on-site or disposing of them at off-site landfills or other facilities. Typical materials disposed of include coal gasification byproducts, fuel oils, ash, and other materials that might contain PCBs or that otherwise might be hazardous. In recent years it has been determined that such disposal practices, under certain circumstances, can cause groundwater contamination.

Renewables. Renewables’ projects are subject to a variety of state environmental review and permitting requirements. Many states where Renewables’ projects are located, or may be located in the future, have laws that require state agencies to evaluate a broad array of environmental impacts before granting state permits. Generally, state agencies evaluate similar issues as federal agencies, including the project’s impact on wildlife, historic sites, aesthetics, wetlands and water resources, agricultural operations and scenic areas. States may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. Additional approvals may be required for specific aspects of a project, such as stream or wetland crossings, impacts to designated significant wildlife habitats, storm water management and highway department authorizations for oversize loads and state road closings during construction. Permitting requirements related to transmission lines may be required in certain cases.
Renewables’ projects also are subject to local environmental and regulatory requirements, including county and municipal land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements. Permitting at the local municipal or county level often consists of obtaining a special use or conditional use permit under a land use ordinance or code, or, in some cases, rezoning is required for a project. Obtaining a permit usually requires that Renewables demonstrates that the project will conform to certain development standards specified under the ordinance so that the project is compatible with existing land uses and protects natural and human environments. Local or state regulatory agencies may require modeling and measurement of permissible sound levels in connection with the permitting and approval of Renewables’ projects. Local or state agencies also may require Renewables to develop decommissioning plans for dismantling the project at the end of its functional life and establish financial assurances for carrying out the decommissioning plan.
In addition to permits required under state and local laws, Renewables’ projects may be subject to permitting and other regulatory requirements arising under federal law. For example, if a project is located near wetlands, a permit may be required from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or Army Corps, with respect to the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States. The Army Corps may also require the mitigation of any loss of wetland functions and values that accompanies the project’s activities. In addition, Renewables may be required to obtain permits under the federal Clean Water Act for water discharges, such as storm water runoff associated with construction activities, and to follow a variety of best management practices to ensure that water quality is protected and impacts are minimized. Renewables’ projects also may be located, or partially located, on lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. Therefore, Renewables may be required to obtain and maintain BLM right-of-way grants for access to, or operations on, such lands. To obtain and maintain a grant, there must be environmental reviews conducted, a plan of development implemented and a demonstration that there has been compliance with the plan to protect the environment, including measures to protect biological, archeological and cultural resources encountered on the grant.
Renewables’ projects may be subject to requirements pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, or ESA, and analogous state laws. For example, federal agencies granting permits for Renewables’ projects consider the impact on endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the ESA, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for harming endangered or threatened species and their habitats. Renewables’ projects also need to consider the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, or MBTA, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, or BGEPA, which protect migratory birds and bald and golden eagles and are administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Criminal liability can result from violations of the MBTA and the BGEPA, even for incidental takings of migratory birds. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has recently entered into settlements with two large wind farm operators, pursuant to which those operators pled guilty to criminal violations of the MBTA and agreed to substantial penalties and mitigation measures.
In addition to regulations, voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set forth siting, monitoring and coordination protocols that are designed to support wind development in the United States while also protecting both birds and bats and their habitats. These guidelines include provisions for specific monitoring and study conditions which need to be met in order for projects to be in adherence with these voluntary guidelines. Most states also have similar laws. Because the operation of wind turbines may result in injury or fatalities to birds and bats, federal and state agencies often recommend or require that Renewables conduct avian and bat risk assessments prior to issuing permits for its projects. They may also require ongoing monitoring or mitigation activities as a condition to approving a project.
Global Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emission Issues
Global climate change and greenhouse gas emission issues continue to receive an increased focus from state governments and the federal government. In November 2010, the EPA published final rules for monitoring and reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems that emit greenhouse gases under the authority of the Clean Air Act beginning in 2011. These regulations apply to facilities that emit greenhouse gases above the threshold level of 25,000 metric tons equivalent per year. SCG and CNG both exceed this threshold and are subject to reporting requirements. The liquefied natural gas, or LNG, facilities owned and/or contracted by SCG and CNG are also subject to the monitoring and reporting requirements under the regulations. Similarly, Networks is subject to reporting requirements under provisions of the greenhouse gases regulations, which regulate electric transmission and distribution equipment that emit sulfur hexafluoride.
19

We are continuously evaluating the regulatory risks and regulatory uncertainty presented by climate change and greenhouse gas emission. Such concerns could potentially lead to additional rules and regulations that impact how we operate our business. We expect that any costs of these rules and regulations would be recovered from customers.
OSHA and Certain Other Federal Safety Laws
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard and standards administered by other federal as well as state agencies, including the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and the related implementing regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations of our subsidiaries and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
Management, Disposal and Remediation of Hazardous Substances
We own or lease real property and may be subject to federal, state and local requirements regarding the storage, use, transportation and disposal of petroleum products and toxic or hazardous substances, including spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements. Project properties and materials stored or disposed thereon may be subject to the federal RCRA, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state laws. If any of our owned or leased properties are contaminated, whether during or prior to our ownership or operation, we could be responsible for the costs of investigation and cleanup and for any related liabilities, including claims for damage to property, persons or natural resources. Such responsibility may arise even if we were not at fault and did not cause the contamination. In addition, waste generated by our operating subsidiaries is at times sent to third party disposal facilities. If such facilities become contaminated, the operating subsidiary and any other persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at those sites may be jointly and severally responsible for the costs of investigation and remediation, as well as for any claims of damages to third parties, their property or natural resources.
On September 16, 2015, UI signed a partial consent order that was then issued by DEEP in August 2016 related to the investigation and remediation of the English Station site. The consent order requires UI to investigate and remediate certain environmental conditions within the perimeter of the English Station site. Under the consent order, to the extent that the cost of this investigation and remediation is less than $30 million, UI is required to remit to the State of Connecticut the difference between such cost and $30 million to be applied to a public purpose as determined in the discretion of the Governor of the State of Connecticut, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut and the Commissioner of DEEP. However, UI is obligated to comply with the consent order even if the cost of such compliance exceeds $30 million. The state may discuss options with UI on recovering or funding any cost above $30 million, such as through public funding or recovery from third parties, however it is not bound to agree to or support any means of recovery or funding.
Customers
Networks delivers natural gas and electricity to residential, commercial and institutional customers through its regulated utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Networks’ customer payment terms are regulated by the states of New York, with respect to NYSEG and RG&E; Maine, with respect to CMP and MNG; Connecticut, with respect to UI, SCG and CNG; and Massachusetts, with respect to BGC, and each of the regulated utilities must provide extended payment arrangements to customers for past due balances. See “—Networks” for more information relating to the customers of Networks.
Renewables sells the majority of its output to large investor-owned utilities, public utilities and other credit-worthy entities. Additionally, Renewables generates and provides power, among other services, to federal and state agencies, institutional retail and joint action agencies. Offtakers typically purchase renewable energy from Renewables through long-term PPAs, allowing Renewables to limit its exposure to market volatility. Approximately 71% of Renewables’ wind generating capacity is fully committed under PPAs as of December 31, 2018, with an average duration of 8.5 years. Renewables also delivers thermal output to wholesale customers in the Western United States.
Competition
Networks’ regulated public utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts do not generally face competition from other companies that transmit and distribute electricity and natural gas. However, demand for electricity and natural gas may be negatively impacted by federal and state legislation mandating that certain percentages of power delivered to end users be produced from renewable resources, such as wind, thermal and solar energy.
Networks faces competition from self-contained micro-grids that integrate renewable energy sources in the areas served by Networks. However, there has been limited development of these micro-grids in Networks’ service areas to date, and Networks 
20

expects that growth in distributed generation of renewable energy will continue due to financial incentives being provided by federal and state legislation. Networks has experienced significant growth in alternative distribution sources of generation on its network over the past ten years, with approximately 90% of the growth coming from solar photovoltaic facilities.
Renewables has competitive advantages, including a robust development pipeline, a management team with extensive experience, strong relationships with suppliers and clients, expert regulatory knowledge and brand awareness. However, Renewables faces competition throughout the life cycles of its energy facilities, including during the development phase, in the identification and procurement of suitable sites with high wind resource availability, grid connection capacity and land availability. Renewables also competes with other suppliers in securing long-term PPAs with power purchasers and participates in competitive bilateral and organized energy markets with other energy sources for power that is not sold under PPAs. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered from time to time by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies.

Infrastructure Protection and Cyber Security Measures
We have risk based security measures in place designed to protect our facilities, assets and cyber-infrastructure, such as our transmission and distribution system.
While we have not had any significant security breaches, a physical security intrusion could potentially lead to theft and the release of critical operating information. In addition to physical security intrusions, a cyber breach could potentially lead to theft and the release of critical operating information or confidential customer information.
To manage these operational risks, pursuant to the cybersecurity risk policy and corporate security policy approved by the AVANGRID board, we have implemented cyber and physical security measures and continue to strengthen our security posture by improving and expanding our physical and cyber security capabilities to protect critical assets.
In an effort to reduce our vulnerability to cyber attacks, the AVANGRID board appointed a senior officer responsible for security (chief security officer) and we have established a dedicated corporate security office, responsible for improving and 
23

coordinating security and NERC compliance across the company. We have adopted a comprehensive company-wide physical and cyber security program, which is supported by a governance program to manage, oversee and assist us in meeting our corporate, legal and regulatory responsibilities with regard to the protection of our cyber, physical and information assets.
However, as threats evolve and grow increasingly more sophisticated, we cannot ensure that a potential security breach may not occur or quantify the potential impact of such an event. We continue to invest in technology, processes, security measures and services to predict, detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber. These investments include upgrades to our cyber-infrastructure assets, network architecture and physical security measures, and compliance with emerging industry best practice and regulation.
