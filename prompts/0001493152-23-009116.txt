Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
We are an agri-food tech company specializing in eco crop protection that helps reduce food waste and ensure food safety while reducing the use of pesticides. We develop eco-friendly “green” solutions for the food industry. Our solutions are developed to improve the food safety and shelf life of fresh produce. We do this by controlling human and plant pathogens, thereby reducing spoilage, and in turn, reducing food loss.
 
Our solutions are based on Save Foods’ proprietary blend of food acids combined with certain types of oxidizing agent-based sanitizers and in some cases with fungicides at low concentrations. Save Foods products have a synergistic effect when combined with these oxidizing agent-based sanitizers and fungicides. Our “green” solutions are capable of cleaning, sanitizing and controlling pathogens on fresh produce with the goal of making them safer for human consumption and extending their shelf life by reducing their decay. One of the main advantages of our products is that our ingredients do not leave any toxicological residues on the fresh produce we treat. In contrary, by forming a temporary protective shield around the fresh produce we treat, our products make it difficult for pathogens to develop and potentially provide protection which also reduces cross-contamination.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) Food Safety Modernization Act (the “FSMA”) is transforming the United States’ food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness to preventing it. According to the recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 48 million people in the United States get sick each year from foodborne diseases. We believe this is a significant public health burden that is largely preventable. Since 2011, the FDA has had a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, science-based preventive controls across the food supply. In the context of fresh produce at packing houses, the FDA’s final produce safety rule (with an initial compliance date of January 26, 2018) provides for the use of sanitizers to ensure produce is cleaned from human pathogens.

In addition, most conventional chemical pesticides (fungicides), which are currently used to protect fresh produce from microbial spoilage and reduce food waste, are potentially toxic, they remain on fruit peel and present health concerns, while also polluting the environment. Therefore, the use of these products is strictly regulated and their residue on food and on the environment are carefully monitored. Today’s trends led by both consumers and regulatory bodies are to significantly reduce the use of fungicides and switch to greener solutions. In a series of studies conducted in collaboration with a large post-harvest service company during the second quarter of 2020, our products have shown impressive results in extending the shelf life of fresh produce in “organic” (where no fungicides are used at the post-harvest stage) and conventional (where fungicides are being used at the post-harvest stage) settings. On average, our products may reduce the rotten fruits at the retail level by 50%.
 
We have a unique opportunity to make a positive difference throughout the food value chain from field to fork and address two of the major’s challenges in the food industry today - safety and waste. We target major markets that use conventional chemical pesticides and sanitizers, including the pre- and post-harvest market, the greenhouse market and the fresh-cut market, where our “green” treatments are used as alternatives for, or mixed with, conventional products in order to reduce (i) health and environmental concerns, and/or (ii) microbial resistance that has reduced the efficacy of conventional chemical pesticides.

In connection therewith, our board of directors instructed management of Save Foods Ltd. to reduce its headcount, including at the managerial level. We have reduced our full-time employee headcount and anticipate additional and related cuts during the remainder of 2023. Furthermore, following such cost reduction measures, we decided to reduce our research and development expenses by changing our strategic focus to the commercialization of our products and the conversion of completed pilots into paying customers. 
Industry Overview and Market Opportunity
 
Background
 
The world’s population is expected to grow to almost 10 billion people by 2050, boosting agricultural demand by some 50%. Providing healthy and safe food to feed the world’s population is one of the biggest challenges of the twenty first century, accentuated with the backdrop of a fragile global economy. Globally, around one-third of the food produced (estimated at circa 1.3 billion tons), is lost or wasted along the food chain - from production to consumption.

-



Fruits and vegetables are considered essential food commodities and demonstrate their best benefits when consumed fresh. Consumption as well as production of fresh fruit and vegetables is growing globally; in 2020, the global production of fresh fruit amounted to about 887 million tons, while the production of fresh vegetable amounted to about 1.09 billion tons (2018). According to a report published by Technavio in October 2020, the fresh food market size has the potential to grow by 337.76 million tons from 2020 to 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of almost 3% during the forecast period, and the market’s growth momentum will accelerate during the forecast period due to the steady increase in year-over-year growth. In the United States, according to a report by Grand View Research, increasing health awareness among the U.S. population and potential development of secondary diseases due to obesity and unhealthy eating habits are propelling the market of fruit and vegetables to reach an estimated $1.1 billion by 2025.
 
Food Safety and Food Loss
 
Food Safety
 
We believe foodborne diseases are a significant public health concern globally. Hundreds of diseases are caused by eating contaminated food. Many diseases are spread through unwashed or untreated produce. With approximately 48 million people in the United States (one in six) getting sick, 128,000 hospitalized, and 3,000 die each year from foodborne diseases, according to recent data published by the FDA, and 23 million in the European region getting sick due to food borne disease, food safety is another major concern and source of waste, placing a material burden on public health and significant healthcare cost. The economic burden of foodborne illness has been estimated to be as high as $90 billion annually.
 
When considering the farm-to-fork chain, microbial contamination of fresh produce can occur at multiple steps. Contamination can take place during the cultivation of fresh produce, at harvest, during preparation/washing, within distribution chains and transport to shops, and even at the final step in the consumers’ kitchen. We believe this is a significant public health burden that is largely preventable. The FSMA is transforming the United States food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness to preventing it. The Produce Safety rule of the FSMA establishes, for the first time, science-based minimum standards for the safe growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of fruits and vegetables grown for human consumption. The final rule went into effect on January 26, 2016. Sanitization is a cornerstone of FSMA compliance, which requires preventing or eliminating food safety hazards or reducing such hazards to a minimal level.
 
Markets require many types of produce to be washed prior to sale in order to remove dirt and other debris. Produce can be contaminated with foodborne pathogens before it enters the packing house, and these pathogens cannot be seen with the naked eye. Inability to visually spot pathogens makes the washing step one of the most important steps in packing because, if washing process is not controlled, it can become a source of cross-contamination (when foodborne pathogens fall off contaminated produce into the water where they can contaminate more produce). These washing steps are defined by the packing house safety managers as critical point because water mixed with organic materials are good conditions for pathogens to develop. Therefore, the use of sanitizers should be introduced during the washing step because they are, most of the time, one of the last solutions applied before the produce meets the consumer. Sanitizers are designed to inactivate/kill any bacteria in the water, drastically reducing the possibility of cross-contamination. We believe this represents a significant opportunity for us.

Food Loss
 
The Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations predicts that about one-third of the food produced globally is wasted or lost every year. Approximately 644 million tons of fruits and vegetables are thrown away each year (representing 42% of the total food wasted every year). A report published in April 2020, generated by the European Innovation Partnership Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability, estimates that in Europe an estimated 9 million tons of food is lost at the production stage (farm), while up to 16.9 million tons are lost at the processing stage (packing houses, etc.).
 

Much of this loss is caused by spoilage, which can be caused by microorganisms - primarily fungi and mold. In addition, mold and fungi represent the highest numbers of incidents of post-harvest microbial diseases in fresh produce worldwide. Taken together, it is estimated that nearly a third of all food grown is lost between the time that it is grown and harvested and the time that it is packaged for retail sale. Such waste equates to roughly $680 billion in industrialized countries and $310 billion in developing countries.
 
Post-harvest losses due to spoilage represent a significant problem along the supply chain and lead to profit losses in the millions. The main causes of these losses are pest or disease infestation and incorrect storage conditions, which lead to rotting or loss of fresh mass. Fruits and vegetables are largely damaged after harvest by fungi and other pathogens. It is estimated that an average of 45% of harvested fruit and vegetables are lost globally. Post-harvest diseases have been identified as the greatest cause of post-harvest losses in fruits and vegetables, causing significant economic losses. It is estimated that approximately 20 to 25% of the fruit and vegetables harvested are lost due to microbial spoilage during post-harvest handling in developed countries. Furthermore, the demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, especially exotic tropical fruit has contributed to the demand for post-harvest treatments to increase shelf life and maintain quality, resulting in more efficient export trade.
 
Today, the most common way to protect fresh produce and prevent loss is the use of hazardous chemicals such as fungicides in post-harvest applications. Post-harvest diseases are generally controlled by fungicides. Systemic (non-organic) fungicides, are one of the most commonly used fungicides, for example, non-organic citrus fruits are completely covered by the fungicides, and the residue is persistent for the life of the fruit providing protection. However, as they tend to affect a single biochemical pathway within the pathogen, fungi may readily develop resistance to systemic fungicides. To avoid potential issues with resistance, maximum concentration of fungicides will be generally used to ensure highly efficient eradication of the targeted pathogen which leaves high residue level on the treated produce. Such high concentration levels may have severe negative effects on human health, and the environment mainly due to the carcinogenic and/or teratogenic properties of the compounds, and by their cumulative toxic effects.

-


The effects of exposure to these hazardous chemicals on humans and the environment are a continuing concern as they are intrinsically toxic and pollute the environment through wastewater discharge from the packing house or a discarded fruit. Therefore, the agricultural use of certain pesticides (in the field or in the packing house) has been significantly reduced or abandoned in some countries leaving the growers with significant challenges.
 
To control and monitor the potential negative impacts pesticides might have over time, regulatory agencies that regulate pesticides - for example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the Pest Management Authority Agency in Canada, and the European Food Safety Authority (“EFSA”) in Europe, have defined a maximum residue level (the “MRL”) that can be present on the treated produce. Additionally, more countries require an MRL for the commodity to be imported into their country. As there is increased awareness regarding compliance with MRLs, MRLs have become a much greater concern. These changes have also impacted the market and we believe that consumers spearheaded this change by demanding organic or pesticide-free foods. Recently, consumers have increasingly wanted to understand where and how their food is grown. Retailers and processors have capitalized on what they view as an opportunity to offer more information to consumers. It is more common now for retailers and processors to ask which products have been used on the commodities they are purchasing. There are also retailers and processors banning the use of certain products, requiring any residues to be below the established MRLs. The reduction in MRLs results in lower efficacy of fungicide and increased loss.
 
We believe that the rising demand for healthy food among the global population will trigger the market’s growth in the forthcoming years. Over the last decade, the organic market in Europe continued to grow and reached €40.7 billion in 2018 with 15.6 million hectares (approximately 38,548,439 acres) (including 2.2 million hectares in Spain, the largest organic area in Europe, followed by 2.0 million hectares in France and 2.0 million hectares in Italy), providing farmers with further added value on their production. The strong growth rates in both production and consumption indicate that the organic market has not yet reached its peak and further growth can still be expected. Organic farming is already responding to further emerging consumer trends such as veganism and demand for locally produced food products, turning these challenges into opportunities.
 
As consumer demand for organic fruits and vegetables is increasing globally and there is an increasing promotion by government organizations for the adoption of environmentally friendly pesticides, the biorational pesticides market, estimated at $3.1 billion in the year 2022, is projected to reach a revised size of $4.985 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 8.2% during the forecast period 2022-2028. A biorational pesticide is a term used to define any pesticide material that causes relatively no harm to humans or animals and does little or no damage to the environment. We believe that our products could be defined as biorational products.
 
The global organic food market grew from $259.06 billion in 2022 to $294.54 billion in 2023 at a CAGR of 13.7%. The organic food market is expected to grow from $512.01 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 14.8%1. In addition, strict regulations have been imposed on the usage of pesticides and GMO-produced crops worldwide. This, in turn, has influenced consumer demand for organic fruits and vegetables.

Case Study - Citrus Fruit
 
Citrus fruit, which represent one of the main fruits produced worldwide with more than 100 million tons produced worldwide, can be infected by many fungal pathogens, and these pathogens can cause considerable losses during storage and transportation. Losses are mainly caused by Penicillium digitatum, P. italicum, Aspergillus flavus and Alternaria alternata for citrus fruit. Post-harvest treatments such as thiabendazole, imazalil, sodium ortho-phenil phenate or other active ingredients have been used for many years. They are currently the most commonly used fungicides effective for controlling post-harvest fungal pathogens in citrus and they are used in citrus packing houses to maintain fresh fruit, control post-harvest decay, and extend fruit shelf life. However, significant problems such as environmental issues and health concerns have risen in the citrus industry due to chemical residues or the occurrence of pathogenic resistant strains which require the use of even higher concentration of these post-harvest treatments. However, currently, the residues of imazalil on citrus fruits is being revised by the European Commission. The EFSA put forward a proposal in 2018 to cut the MRL for imazalil from 5 milligrams per kilogram to 0.01 milligrams per kilogram, causing worry among Europe’s main citrus producing countries and packers exporting their produce to European countries. Due to the significant impact this proposal could have on the citrus industry, the European Council has decided, in the meantime, to start reducing imazalil residues to four milligrams per kilogram for citrus fruit for a limited period of time to allow the citrus industry an extra time to find green and safe alternatives. Our solutions have already shown its benefits in reducing significantly the residues of imazalil while maintaining the produce shelf life.
Current Market Drivers and Trends
 
In addition to food safety and food waste concerns, the following market drivers are also shaping the food industry by setting standards and conditions on the main actors in the industry:

● | Focus of consumers on health characteristics: consumers are more aware and conscious of the health characteristics of the food they consume. Consumers pay more attention to the qualities of the fresh produce they buy. Particularly in the United States and Europe, products such as berries, avocados, mangoes, pomegranates, papayas and sweet potatoes are gaining popularity and considered “super foods,” and these products are showing a strong annual import growth of 10% to 20%. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increasing demand for organic produce: the demand for organic products is growing rapidly particularly in both Europe and North America, and is closely related to consumer interest in healthy and pure eating. While the increasing demand created potential for oversees supply, it can be challenging and expansive for exporters in tropical climates to comply with the increasingly demanding organic standards. 
● | Success of retailers determined by quality of produce: a recent report by Fruit Logistica published in 2019, based on consumer surveys that involved almost 7,000 consumers in 14 different markets across Europe and North America, demonstrated the increased importance of fresh produce for the profitability of food retailers. According to the report, when choosing the place to buy their groceries, consumers focus on the quality of the stores’ fresh food, with freshness of fruits and vegetable being their top priority. The report also showed that customers who are satisfied with the store’s fresh food quality, would visit the store more frequently than those who are not. In addition, consumers are also willing to pay more for better-quality produce and their basked will be 4% larger. 
● | Promoting sustainability: a large range of sustainability aspects are directly related and affected by the fresh produce industry. Food waste accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Both consumers and businesses, are becoming more aware of the growing importance of sustainability issues. As consumers increasingly embrace social causes, they seek products and brands that align with their values. According to a recent analysis published by Research Insights, nearly 6 in 10 consumers surveyed are willing to change their shopping habits to reduce environmental impact, nearly 8 in 10 respondents indicated sustainability is important for them, and among those respondents that indicated that sustainability is very or extremely important, over 70% indicated that they would pay a premium of 35%, on average, for brands that are sustainable and environmentally responsible. Increasing number of companies in the fresh food sector are investing in sustainability. Survey conducted by Champions 12.3 in 2017 showed that 99% of businesses that invested in reduction of food loss and waste, received a net positive financial return. Primary production companies are investing in aspects of food losses, energy efficiency and carbon footprint, through innovations such as drying produce, on-farm and off-grid cold rooms and post-harvest treatments.

● | Food retailers seek to reduce their waste and maximize their revenues: more than eight million tons of food are wasted every year in the United States in the retail sector alone, which translates into $18 billion in lost value (cost of waste) every year. Some retailers, including Walmart, have already committed to implement a zero-waste policy by 2025. Prevention solutions across the retail value chain offer the highest returns to retailers and are growing the fastest. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Regulators are promoting the use of safer chemical-based product: for example, the EPA offers a “Safer Choice” label that product manufacturers may use on qualifying products to help consumers and commercial buyers identify products with safer chemical ingredients. The EPA requires that every chemical, regardless of percentage, in a Safer Choice-certified product is evaluated and allows only the safest ingredients. 
● | Increasing investment in foodtech and agritech companies: according to a recent report published by AgFunder, a venture capital firm active in the foodtech and agritech, startups developing agri-food tech solutions and products, raised approximately $51.7 billion into agrifood technologies in 2021; an 85% increase over 20202. Reduction of food waste, extension of the shelf life of fresh produce and reduction of the use of pesticides are main focus of the industry and many companies are addressing these objectives, including: 

 
The increased consumption of fruits and vegetables in combination with the current regulation and consumers’ demand for healthier food has placed a greater burden on the fresh produce industry to provide food products that are fresher in quality, demonstrate an extended shelf life and are safer to consume.
 
The aforementioned changes provide a unique opportunity for us to introduce our products and solutions. We are aiming to become a significant player in post-harvest green produce treatment, fully responsive to the world’s ongoing change in fruit and vegetables consumption, food safety requirements as well as regulations and consumer demand to eliminate the use of hazardous chemicals.
 
Our Core Products and Solutions
 
Our innovative products address what we believe to be two of the most significant challenges in the food industry: food safety promotion and food loss reduction. Our main product lines consist of a proprietary blend of organic food acids applied in pre- and post-harvest applications, which is designed to work together with an oxidizing agent (Save Foods solution) in order to improve food safety and increase fruit and vegetable’ shelf life by reducing microbial spoilage.
 
In pre-harvest application, our solutions could be applied several times up to 24 hours prior to the harvest. In post-harvest applications, the main steps are cleaning, sanitization and coating (wax). Our solutions address the cleaning and sanitization application points which are the critical first steps for preserving the quality of fresh produce by controlling microbial contamination related to food safety (e.g., Listeria, Salmonella, E. coli) and food loss due to microbial spoilage (e.g., fungi, mold and yeast). In general, the current process includes an initial washing step to remove soil and other debris, which improves the product appearance and lowers the product temperature. The next step includes sanitation or disinfection methods combined with fungicides that can further reduce the presence and prevent the transfer of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms on fresh produce surfaces. The last step usually includes application of wax sometimes combined with an additional application of fungicides to prevent or reduce physiological changes and risks of spoilage. Our main products and solutions are applied at the cleaning and sanitization steps.
 
One of the main advantages of our solutions based on our food acid blend is its non-toxic residues that are providing protection to the treated produce. And we believe that all the blend ingredients are recognized by the FDA as GRAS when used as intended in fruit and vegetable wash applications. Moreover, they significantly reduce or eliminate the need for additional post-harvest applications with conventional fungicide by at least 50%, and in some cases entirely, and can reduce food waste due to spoilage by up to 50% (see results below on easy peelers and mango) at the retail level.

Our main products are SavePROTECT or PeroStar, which are an application added to fruit and vegetable wash water as a processing aid to peracetic acid (oxidizing agent) to increase its efficiency against plant pathogens and reduce produce loss.
 
Processing Aids - SavePROTECT or PeroStar
 
Processing aids are products that are intended to be used with other products to aid the application or enhance the effect of that product. Save Foods processing aids, which are marketed as SavePROTECT in the Americas and PeroStar in the rest of the world, are based on our proprietary blend of food acids and are added to the wash water at the cleaning and sanitization stages simultaneously with a low concentration of peracetic acid (“PAA”), the active agent. This food acid blend serves several functions:
 

● | SavePROTECT/PeroStar keeps the process wash waters at a relatively low stable pH level. We have observed that low pH levels strengthen the effectiveness of the PAA and the fungicide used which result in increased sanitation and biocide activity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | PAA-based products are used as disinfectant in wash water. When used with PAA-based products, SavePROTECT/PeroStar may optimize the efficacy of PAA and eliminates the strong odor of PAA, creating a more friendly and safe working environment; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | When used with fungicides, including imidazole, imazalil, thiabendazole, etc. - most commonly used fungicides - SavePROTECT/PeroStar may optimize the efficacy of the fungicides used and prevent resistance buildup; 
● | SavePROTECT/PeroStar helps to clean the fruit surface and can improve the performance of the wax applied leading to an improved appearance of treated fruit by leaving a glossy finish on the outer skin of the fruit; and 
● | SavePROTECT/PeroStar helps to extend shelf life. 

 
During 2020, we ran a series of proof of concept and small trials in collaboration with commercial partners on pears, avocado, easy peelers, lime, mango, bell pepper, lemons, fresh cut vegetables and figs. During 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, we initiated a proof of concept in bananas, lychee, berries, pomegranate, broccoli, tomato and eggplant. Since the fourth quarter of 2021, we have expanded our footprint to additional countries that are facing export challenges to Europe such as Peru, Turkey, South Africa and Mexico. As of December 31, 2022, we fully commercialized our solution with respect to easy peelers, lime, bell peppers, dates and avocado.
 
Results on Berries
 
Berries are easily perishable and maintaining fresh quality after harvest depends on proper handling, transportation, and storage. If berries are not properly handled during and after the harvest, they lose nutritional and monetary value.
 
Strawberries, raspberries, black raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries are picked fully ripe for best appearance and eating quality. Because they are so delicate and easily damaged, they are usually picked directly into final containers to minimize handling, so grading and sorting of damaged or decaying fruit happens as the crop is picked. Even when they are handled under optimal harvesting temperature and humidity conditions, their shelf life is still short compared to most fruits and vegetables. Finally, even though it is common knowledge that consumers should be washing the berries before consuming them, this doesn’t always happen. That makes farm food safety procedures crucial to minimize the risk of spreading foodborne pathogens.

During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021, and the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022, we began working with raspberries and strawberries producers to apply our solutions with the goal to extend their shelf life. The results of the trials have shown that for raspberries, our solutions have reclaimed 80% of the raspberries that would otherwise have gone to waste. The trial pushed the boundaries of the raspberries’ shelf life, with 10 days in cold storage and three more days at room temperature, after which three times as many berries were viable to be sold. For strawberries, our treatments have shown a waste reduction of 85% after 15 days.
 

In addition, after successful pilots on raspberries and strawberries, we decided to conduct a pilot on blueberries in February 2022. In most cases, there are no known treatments for disinfection or post-harvest pathogen prevention in blueberries. The experiment simulated long shipment of blueberries in cold storage for one month. The results demonstrated that our solution protected blueberries from pathogens’ contamination and, subsequently, extended their shelf life by seven days.

Results on Avocado
 
During September 2021, we began a commercial pilot with Milopri, the avocado packer of Galilee Export, to evaluate Save Foods’ solution on avocados. While our application was applied on the packing line, boxes of avocado were put aside for shelf-life evaluation. After 16 days at room temperature, the avocado treated with our solution showed the lowest percentage of decay resulting in two times more avocado available for consumption.
 
Following this successful commercial pilot, Milopri fully adopted and implemented our solutions by August 2022 with the intention to be ready for the 2022 - 2023 avocado season, which began in September 2022 and is expected to end by the end of the second quarter of 2023.
 

Results on Bell-peppers
 
The Arava region in southern Israel produces approximately 60% of all the fresh vegetables that Israel exports, and bell peppers are its leading exported vegetable. At the beginning of the bell pepper season (September 2021), we began commercial pilots in two large packing houses in order to evaluate the benefits of our solution as applied to bell peppers. During September 2022, after successfully evaluating our solutions, these two large packing houses began using our solutions as their commercial treatment.
 
Our solutions have shown a decay reduction compared to the current industry standards and have maintained the firmness of the bell pepper overtime. While Israeli packers in the region are struggling to maintain a reasonable shelf life for their produce during the export process, our solutions have shown a significant improvement in export performance. The foregoing pilot demonstrated that bell peppers, after applying our solution, sustained 70% less decay after 28 days (23 days in cold storage and an additional five days at room temperature) translating into 20% more bell peppers to sell and consume. The post-harvest team at the Central-and Northern-Arava Research and Development center validated these results and the results were thereafter published in an Israeli local professional agriculture journal.

Results on Easy Peelers
 
Easy peelers are citrus fruits that are easier to peel, such as tangerines, mandarins, satsumas, and clementines. As previously described, imazalil is currently one of the most commonly used fungicide that is effective in controlling post-harvest fungal pathogens in citrus. Currently, the residues of imazalil on citrus fruit is being revised by the European Commission and have already been reduced, and this reduction poses challenges, especially to packing houses exporting to Europe.
 
Between February and June 2020, we collaborated with the Israeli branch of one of the largest worldwide post-harvest service companies to demonstrate the safety and ability of PeroStar to meet the new requirement of reduced residue level of imazalil and efficiently control decay against the most common pathogens attacking citrus fruit such as green mold (Penecillium digitatum) and sour rot (Geotrichum candidum). The experiment simulated the applications in a packing house which tested the use of imazalil with and without our products. The reference used in the trials to compare the results was the maximum amount of imazalil allowed and the current treatment in the packing house which is a combination of PAA and imazalil as well as PAA alone to simulate treatment in organic settings.
 
To ensure the efficacy of the products, it is customary to deliberately infect the fruit with the target pathogen at a concentration of around 10 and to inoculate it for 16 to 24 hours before applying the solution. Following the application, the fruit was stored in cold storage for between 9 to 21 days and then stored in room temperature for shelf-life evaluation.
 
During these months, we ran a series of trials from small scale/lab test (between 350 to 500 fruits per trial) to semi-commercial application (more than 1000 fruits per trial). The semi-commercial pilots were run in Ashkelon, Israel on the packing line of Mehadrin in Israel, a well-know and recognized citrus packer. From January 2022 until January 2023, Mehadrin was applying our solutions on produce in one of its packing-lines in Ashkelon, Israel, in which Mehadrin had reported a reduction of 50% of pesticide usage. Due to technical reasons, our commercial implementation with Mehadrin recently transitioned to a packing-line in Netanya, Israel, for additional pilots.
 
The results of the trials have shown that PeroStar significantly reduced the need for additional post-harvest applications with imazalil by at least 50%, and in some cases entirely while improving the fruit shelf life, reducing waste). In addition, the use of PeroStar allows the packing house to meet the new limitations of imazalil utilization as well as meet its goal to apply greener and safer products (see graph below).

Results on Mangos
 
We recently tested our PeroStar on mangos in collaboration with the Israeli-based Volcani Center for Agricultural Research. The goal of the test was to evaluate the effectiveness of PeroStar in preventing decay in harvested mangos in comparison with fludioxonil. Fludioxonil is a fungicide that is commercially available in Israel at a level of 250 to 300 parts per million. Fludioxonil is deemed to be an effective fungicide against fungi that attack the mango post-harvest, yet there is a growing need for “greener” solutions, given Fludioxonil’s level of toxicity.
 
Mangos were stored for three weeks after treatment at 12°C and an additional week of shelf life at 20°C in what would typically simulate a mango crate shipment to Europe and retailers in similarly distanced markets.
 
Results after evaluation have shown us that the treatment with PeroStar, improved the biocide activity of the PAA, which resulted in a reduction in both side decay and stem-end rot (common pathogens in mango) leading to an extended shelf life with no use of fungicide (as demonstrated in the picture below). In addition, the results also showed that the combination of PeroStar with a low concentration of fludioxonil reduced the post-harvest decay to zero. The results (as presented in the graph below) demonstrate that applying PeroStar enables mango producers to achieve an improved shelf life of produce compared to the current solution while reducing the use of conventional chemical pesticides.
 
During 2022, an independent study, performed by Itay Noked, agronomist and independent researcher (M.Sc. Post-Harvest), showed that our solution can extend the shelf life and freshness of mangos while virtually eliminating the use of post-harvest pesticides; after 21 days in storage and 15 days on the shelf, twice as many mangos were still edible when compared to mangos that didn’t undergo treatment, and 75% less pesticides were used.
 
Following these pilots, a commercial application was performed with an Israeli mango packer, in which only 25% fungicide were used together with our solution and compared to the current commercial application with 100% fungicide. Following such application, both batches of fruits were sent to a leading fresh produce distributor in Europe, and both were successfully distributed, demonstrating that our solutions help reduce up to 75% of the applied fungicide. We expect to start our commercial activities during the upcoming mango season in 2023.

Results on Limes
 
Following a successful pilot in Mexico on Persian lime (where SavePROTECT has reduced to zero the fruit decay after 21 days as shown in the graph below), the packing house bought its first batch to start its utilization of our product. Thereafter, and beginning in June 2021, the packing house began applying our solution to all of its packing facilities in Mexico.

--


Based on these results, food retailers may benefit from additional income of up to $126 per ton of limes assuming a conservative average price of $3,000 per ton (based on an average price per pound lime of $1.49 in 2019), as presented in the graph below.
 

The European Union is a significant target market for our organic food acid blends because of strict regulations that are being imposed on the use of pesticides and GMO-produced crops, as well as health conscious consumers who represent a growing demand for organic fruits and vegetables. In August 2020, we submitted a regulatory dossier for our PeroStar as a processing aid to be used with PAA in Spain and Italy, two of the largest fruit and vegetables producers in Europe. See “Government Regulation and Product Approval” below.
 
Commercialization Stage
 
The table below summarizes our commercialization efforts and activities as of February 2023.

Sanitizer – SF3HS or SF3H
 
Post-harvest sanitizers are considered a pesticide and regulated by the EPA in the United States. The EPA will review toxicity data and results from tests to show how well the product kills bacteria to determine if the product should be approved. See “Government Regulation and Product Approval” below.
 
This sub-category of products is based on our proprietary blend of food acids combined with hydrogen peroxide as the oxizider and includes SF3HS and SF3H. We believe that this category of products will be an improved sanitizer as compared to traditional sanitizers. SF3HS and SF3H are public health antimicrobial pesticide products that bear a claim to control by at least a 3 log10 reduction (99.9%) pest microorganisms that pose a threat to human health (foodborne pathogens), and whose presence cannot readily be observed by the consumer.
 
After we have finalized our toxicological studies, we conducted a series of microbial trials in laboratories in both the United States and Israel in non-Good Laboratory Practice settings in order to evaluate the efficacy of SF3H as an antimicrobial agent to reduce foodborne pathogenic bacteria in “processing water” for fruit and vegetables. We used a modification of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists Germicidal and Detergent Sanitizing Action of Disinfectants method and test protocol EN1276 (European standard for the evaluation of chemical disinfectant or antiseptic for bactericidal activity). The tested organisms are Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7.

--


The last test was performed by Analytical Lab Group on a mix culture of Listeria monocytogenes with an exposure time of 30 seconds. The results showed more than 99.99999% (>7.51 Log10) reduction. In Israel, the tests were performed by the Institute for Food Microbiology and Consumer Good Health on a single strain for each pathogen (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli) with exposure time of 30 seconds and the results have shown between 99.99% to 99.9999% reduction. Exposure time is a key parameter in sanitization process, therefore allowing a short contact time is a significant advantage over the competition where the current minimum contact time available is 45 seconds.
 
Following the advice of our board of Directors, we recently decided to postpone our GLP efficacy studies for the time being in order to concentrate our efforts on the commercialization of our adjuvant, SavePROTECT/ PeroStar solutions.
 
Results on Avocados (food safety)
 
We have tested the efficacy of our SF3H and SF3HS products against Listeria on 40 avocados of which 10 avocados were treated with our SF3H and SF3HS products. The peel of the avocado was punctured and infected with high level of Listeria. The results have shown a 99.99% reduction within fifteen seconds of exposure time. In addition, we have also tested the efficacy of SF3H on avocado’s shelf life compared to current treatments (12 avocados per treatment). The results (demonstrated below) show that after 18 days in room temperature the treated avocados display material reduction in microbial spoilage as compared to avocados treated with water and chlorine, a well-known sanitizer.
 
Results on Microgreens (food safety)
 
An increasing number of studies point to the growing demand for locally sourced, organic vegetables. Various types of “young vegetables,” such as sprouts, microgreens and baby greens, are becoming increasingly popular due to their high nutritional value. Microgreens are deemed premium products and command higher retail value. They also belong to a group of “functional foods” and have high levels of bioactive compounds, while requiring less water and energy to grow, which they do year-round. Currently, microgreens are largely being cultivated in major greenhouses across the United States. According to Agrilyst, an agro-intelligence platform, greenhouse cultivation of microgreens was the highest in South and Northeast regions, each accounting for 71% and 59% in 2017. While consumers in the United States are more focused on growing leafy greens and microgreens than any other vegetables.
 
We have tested the efficacy of our SF3H products to control and prevent potential pathogen contamination on microherbs (pea and sorrel) produced by Israeli-based microgreens exporter 2BFresh. Our treatment combined a post-harvest spray application and a fogging treatment to be used in the cooldown storage room. In order to determine the efficacy of the product, 25 swabs were taken across 18 trays (nine of each microgreen species). The results showed more than 90% reduction of the total bacterial load post-treatment.
 
We believe that our SF3HS and SF3H provide improved sanitization of bacteria (including E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria) while leaving no toxic residues on fruits and vegetables.
 
We expect the first commercialization of SF3H and SF3HS at the earliest by the end of -2025.
 
Other Products
 
Our product portfolio also includes the SpuDefender and FreshProtect.
 
SpuDefender
 
SpuDefender is one of our EPA-registered products which targets and is designed to control the post-harvest potato sprout. Due to the European Commission’s decision on January 1, 2020, to no longer allow the use of the herbicide chlorpropham (the “CIPC”), the post-harvest potato industry is looking for new solutions. For over 50 years, CIPC was widely used as a sprout suppressing agrochemical agent applied to potatoes that were stored in processing facilities.

19
--


Following recent discussions with post-harvest experts and potential customers, we believe we should concentrate our efforts on the commercialization of our adjuvants. Furthermore, we believe that our SpuDefender product may offer a successful alternative to CIPC. We intend to initiate pilot tests with potential customers to treat potatoes pre-storage (three to six months storage in average) in 2024.
 
FreshProtect
 
FreshProtect is our second EPA registered product, which targets and is designed to control spoilage-creating microorganisms on post-harvest citrus fruit. The registered label of the product only allows us to market and sell FreshProtect in the United States (excluding California). However, we believe that FreshProtect has a significant potential in reducing the bacterial load entering the packing house in the pre-harvest market. The non-toxicity of FreshProtect allows its application up to the day of harvest (0-day pre-harvest interval), which is critical to prolong crop protection and reduce microbial spoilage.
 
We recently ran a proof-of-concept study under a controlled group environment of different plant fungi responsible for decay which showed promising initial results.
 
Recently, Dr. Jim Adaskaveg, Professor at the Microbiology and Plant Pathology Department at the University of California, Riverside, reported the completion of several successful field trials with FreshProtect on citrus trees where he demonstrated a significant reduction of decay in treated fruit and a reduction in bacterial populations.
 
The main conclusions of the trials were that FreshProtect with concentration of 1% and 2% applied at 400 gallons per acre materially reduced sour-rot on inoculated fruit. While both rates were also effective against fruit inoculated with P. digitatum, (i.e., fungus found in the soil of citrus-producing areas and major source of post-harvest decay), the 2% concentration of FreshProtect demonstrated significantly more efficacy at reducing sour-rot. Natural incidence of Penicillium spp. (a family of fungi) was also reduced on fruit inoculated with G. candidum, fungus that is a member of the human microbiome.
 
Furthermore, FreshProtect can be used in combination with several different kinds of pesticides and fertilizers which allows the application of more than one pesticide at once. This in turn reduces cost and facilitates implementation. The graph below summarizes these results:
 

The regulation for pre-harvest (in the field) application especially in California as well as in Israel may take more time than post-harvest application due the potential impact on the environment. We submitted the pre-harvest regulatory dossier on January 2023 in the US. In parallel, we started to run additional pilots in Israel with potential strategic partners in order for them to evaluate and validate the potential of FreshProtect for the pre-harvest market. We expect the registration of the product in the U.S. by the end of 2023. Once registered at the EPA level, we would be able to start the registration in California.

Our Strengths
 
We believe that our main strengths include:
 

● | Strong Management Team with Commitment to Green Products. Led by an experienced team in developing products and solutions for the agriculture industry, we plan on becoming a significant player in providing consumers with healthy and green fresh produce from farm to fork while endeavoring to ensure food safety and reducing food waste. We believe that our proprietary blend of food acids provides protection to the treated produce and works in synergy with well-known fungicides and sanitizers. This synergy allows us to significantly reduce the concentration of the fungicides that are heavily regulated in several countries and, in certain countries, outright banned and meet the food trends of sustainable and green produce. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Multi-Purpose Products that Simplify Crop Treatment Routine and Save Money. While most chemicals marketed in the industry address either food safety or food waste, our multi-purpose solution are intended to provide a solution for both problems, while simplifying crop treatment and achieving cost saving. Our solutions are capable of cleaning and controlling pathogens that would otherwise render fresh produce as unsafe for human consumption. Our proprietary blend of food acids combined with well-known sanitizers are very efficient against foodborne pathogens like E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria as well as plant pathogens in short contact time (99.999% reduction within 30 seconds of contact). In addition, with multipurpose products, there is no need to order, ship or dispose of bottles of product, resulting in less energy consumed, less CO2, less fuel, and less waste. We believe our focus on natural product chemistries will allow us to continually drive lower costs, higher product gross margins and efficacy through longer shelf life and reduction of food waste. 
● | Strong Intellectual Property Portfolio. We believe that we have built a strong intellectual property position throughout the food chain (from field to fork) as our patents claim compositions and methods that can be used to protect food and agricultural products from decay. We rely on a combination of important intellectual property assets, to protect our innovation. Our employees, consultants, customers, and vendors are subject to confidentiality agreements that protect our proprietary manufacturing processes. Our patent portfolio includes granted patents in the United States, Europe, and Israel, as well as several priority applications, across several patent families, including composition-of-matter claims, methods of use claims, including for treating edible matter, for improving the appearance of edible plant matter, and sterilization methods, as well as for articles for implementing these methods. These patents directly protect a proprietary method for extending life shelf and reducing edible matter from microbial decay. 
● | Commercially Available Products and Seamless Implementation. One of the oxidizers being used with our products is PAA, a well-known and widely used sanitizer. Following the enforcement of the FSMA in connection with the use of sanitizers, more and more packers have been choosing this healthy and eco-friendly sanitizer over chlorine, and this choice facilitates implementation of our products. In addition, the application of our products does not require special equipment as they are used in combination with or replace existing products applied on the packing line or in the mix tank in the field. This allows a relatively cheap, seamless and fast implementation. 
● | Significant Reduction of Hazardous Chemicals Food Residue. All the ingredients in our blend of food acids are recognized by the FDA as GRAS when used as intended in fruit and vegetable wash applications, while oxidizers we use such as hydrogen peroxide rapidly decompose into water and oxygen. The absence of toxicological residues not only improves food quality but also promotes occupational safety for the employees of packing houses, contributing to a friendlier and safer working environment.

Our Strategy
 
In September 2018, we changed our organizational structure and management team. After reviewing the then existing strategy and results of operation, as well as examining the market opportunities, the new management team decided to update our strategy, reduce the marketing and sales of its existing products, and focus our efforts and financial resources in developing its next generation products. During the years 2019 and 2020, we developed, validated and tested the efficacy of our next generation product - a blend of food acids - on a variety of crops in small and large scale commercial pilots. During 2021, following the completion of certain successful pilots conducted in 2020, we shifted our strategic focus to marketing, sales and overall commercialization of its products.
 
Over the course of 2022, we understood that working with global post-harvest service companies is challenging, especially when considering that our solutions reduce or replace their lucrative products (fungicides) on the packing line. Furthermore, we concluded that the validation of our solutions by these post-harvest service companies is long and required multiple pilots over several years. In addition, following the positive results on berries, and taking into account the short shelf life and the lack of existing solutions, we decided to focus our efforts on developing such solutions since a shorter shelf life may reduce our sale cycle and, accordingly, present greater market opportunity. 
 
Therefore, we have revised our strategy, to commercialize our products directly to leading packing houses and through strategic partnerships with post-harvest service companies that work with local partners and/or distributors and focus more on produce that is significantly improved by our solutions while shortening the evaluation period. Our ultimate goal is to eventually gain presence in a variety of businesses compromising the food industry, including pre-harvest, post-harvest, retail and consumer businesses.
 
In order to achieve our goals, we intend to:
 

● | Develop a Strong Marketing Message Around Promoting Safe Food While Avoiding Food Waste. We plan to brand our fresh produce with a “chemical residues free” seal of approval and we believe that like-minded fruit packers around the globe will seek to differentiate themselves from their competitors by obtaining this seal. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand Our Activities to Include Focus on Various Berries. The berry market is virtually untapped and consists of very sensitive produce with limited shelf-life that stand to benefit from our solutions. Berries can be harvested several times throughout the course of the year and are considered to be a high value crop. 
● | Acquire or License Complementary Products and Technologies. We actively search for products and technologies that can enhance our portfolio and grow our business to address all the post-harvest treatments such as fruit coating products or technologies. 
● | Expand to Additional Produce and Geographies. Our plan is to focus first on key countries and regions with the largest markets for our crops, including Mexico, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, and key markets in the United States such as California. In the future, we are also planning to increase the variety of crops that can be treated with our products, to include produce such as apples, tomatoes, pomegranate, eggplant, broccoli, and papayas. 
● | Focus on Exportation to Europe. We plan to increase our focus on exports to Europe as EU regulations permit a limited use of fungicides. When taking into account these regulations, which are becoming increasingly difficult, and the long transportation time, there is a significant increase to the risk of produce decay. 
● | Leverage Our Products Through Collaborations. Our focus and expertise in the development of green products for the agritech industry and in post-harvest treatments allow us to be a partner of choice for other businesses looking for development partners and for larger companies wanting to leverage their product such as PAA into new combination products. For example, companies selling or owning fungicides, the MRL of which is being reduced, and that are working in synergy with our products are good partners. This type of collaboration could allow them to continue selling their product.

Selling and Marketing
 
Although over the course of 2022, we ran over fifty successful pilots with potential commercial partners, we discovered that the sale cycle is significantly longer than we had anticipated and noted it would take, on average, at least two seasons for our new solutions to be fully implemented.
 
Therefore, to maximize our efforts during 2023, we optimized our marketing and sales strategy. We now concentrate our efforts first on high value crops, such as avocado, mango, citrus, pears, various berries, dates and bell peppers, while targeting larger producing countries in both the northern and southern hemispheres to overcome the seasonal effect. By March 2023, we expect to conduct pilots in South and Central America, the United States, South Africa, Turkey, Egypt, and Israel, and we are exploring collaboration opportunities in Morocco. In addition, to shorten the length of our pilots, we now aim to target fresh produce with a comparatively shorter shelf life, including various berries. Over the next 12 months, we intend to focus mainly on following up with the pilots performed during the last 18 months and convert them into full commercial applications. To facilitate our market penetration, we are collaborating with local agents and experts in various jurisdictions, each of which has connections with packers and retailers on the ground, which helps us bridge the language and cultural gaps.


The table below summarizes the market opportunities for selected produce in our target markets.

---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Our general target markets include Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Turkey and the United States. 

Turkey
 
While Turkey is not a member of the EU, the EU estimates that more than 42 percent of all Turkish exports go to EU member states, which will soon be bound by stricter rules about the origin of their imports. Turkey’s Ministry of Trade estimated that in 2020 the total value of Turkish exports to the EU exceeded €120 billion.
 
Since August 2021, we have been working with a local post-harvest agent to introduce us to local Turkish packers. Our current focus in Turkey is the citrus sector, and as of December 2021, we had three pilots ongoing with leading packers in Turkey. Following these pilots, Kalyoncu began implementing our solution in their citrus line next to Mersin.
 
We are targeting additional citrus packing houses in Turkey, which we expect to be ready for the upcoming citrus season of 2022-2023. In addition to citrus, we plan to commence a pilot of our treatment on bell peppers in Turkey.
 
Mexico
 
To promote our activities in Mexico, we are collaborating with Agrinet S. A., an agritech consultancy firm with expertise in introducing new products into Mexico. Agrinet has initiated a pilot program across Mexico to demonstrate the benefits of Save Foods solution. The program included several packing house companies in Mexico that export mainly to the United States. In mid-2022, we decided, together with Agrinet, that it would be economically advantageous to focus on sales with lime packing companies.

Following successful pilots conducted between August and October of 2020 on Persian lime, SiCar, one of the largest packers of Persian lime in Mexico, is now applying our solution in all of their packing houses in Mexico. Mexico is the largest producer of Persian limes.
 
Israel
 
During January 2022, the beginning of the easy peeler season in Israel, Mehadrin, the largest citrus packing house in Israel, began using our solution in their citrus packing houses.
 
Over the course of 2022, we ran additional pilots with large packing houses in Israel on pears, berries, pomegranate and tomatoes. Following several successful pilots on pears, a leading Israeli pear packing company elected to use our solutions as their commercial applications and plans to implement our solutions in its facilities by mid-2023.
 
On September 11, 2020, we signed a five-year exclusive distribution agreement with Safe-Pack Products Ltd., according to which we granted Safe-Pack an exclusive right to resell, distribute, advertise, and market our products in the citrus industry in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Following review and careful consideration, this agreement was not profitable for both parties as initially expected and was mutually terminated in September 2022.
 
United States
 
The first market we target for the sale and distribution of SavePROTECT is the post-harvest citrus industry in the State of California, which alone accounts for approximately 80% of all fruits and vegetables in the United States.
 
Over the last three years, we have treated more than 200,000 tons of citrus fruit with the different version of our SavePROTECT product. Under the supervision of a world leading packing house to the citrus fruit industry, we evidenced SavePROTECT utility as having a good safety profile, ensuring food safety and in controlling microbial spoilage. We plan to leverage this collaboration in order to further penetrate the citrus based fruit packing industry, both in California and beyond.
 
The Post-harvest treatment market for fruits and vegetables, which is projected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $2.3 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period, is led globally by select companies, including DECCO U.S. Post-Harvest, Inc., (United States), Pace International, (United States), Xeda International (France), John Bean Technologies (United States) and Agrofresh (United States).
 
During October 2021, we secured the appropriate regulatory approvals and, accordingly, we plan to further penetrate this market for the upcoming citrus season of 2022-2023. We currently focus on post-harvest treatment for the citrus industry (as well as mangos and avocados) in addition to pilot studies with leading packers expected to begin in March-April 2023, to evaluate and validate the efficiency of our solutions in their packing facilities.
 
On September 22, 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive commission agreement with Earthbound Technologies, LLC (“EBT”) for a period of 12 months, according to which EBT will introduce us to potential clients, pre-approved by us (the “Introduced Parties”) and will assist us in finalizing commercial agreements with the Introduced Parties. In consideration for its services, we agreed to pay EBT 12.5% of the net revenues generated from the Introduced Parties (during the agreement period and within 18 months following the termination of the agreement) up to a total aggregated amount of $2,000,000, provided that the compensation shall not exceed 25% of our gross profit under the given commercial agreement signed with the Introduced Party. In addition, in the event that the aggregated net revenues generated from the Introduced Parties exceeds $500,000, and subject to the approval of our board of directors, we will issue to EBT 7,143 options to purchase 7,143 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.4 per share. In the event that certain additional events detailed in the agreement occur, we will also issue to EBT, subject to the approval of our board of directors, an additional 7,143 options to purchase 7,143 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.4 per share. Until the date hereof, we have paid EBT an aggregate of $18,271 for the year 2022, there were no issuances of shares or options.

Spain
 
Following a collaboration with one of the world’s leading post-harvest treatment service vendors in Spain during 2020, in which we examined our product on citrus fruit, we began the registration process of our product, PeroStar. We believe our product could be an improved alternative to current fungicides that will soon be significantly reduced in this market.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on patents and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary products and intellectual property. We entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, service providers and vendors that cover, inter alia, our technology and proprietary manufacturing processes.
 
As of the date hereof, we own ten issued patents, and one allowed patent application, all which help protect our technology. These patents were granted in Israel, the United States and Europe and are valid until between 2031 and 2041. In addition, eleven further patent applications are also pending in the various stages.
 
Compositions and Methods of Treating Edible Matter and Substrates Therefor
 
This patent family includes granted patents in the United States, Israel, and an allowed application in Europe and is directed to a method for protecting edible matter from decay by applying to the edible matter a disinfecting composition containing, among other things, (1) phosphonic or phosphoric acid, (2) a carboxylic acid, (3) performic acid, (4) a performic acid source (such as formic acid) and an oxidizer (such as hydrogen peroxide).

There is also a significant risk that any issued patents will have substantially narrower claims than those that are currently sought.
 
Competition
 
Given that the market for the use of green and “residue free” solutions is evolving, we are continually facing growing competition. The market for post-harvest solutions is fragmented and includes various regional suppliers. The market of post-harvest treatments for fruits and vegetables is dominated by five large players with wide reach across the globe. We believe that a market edge will be given to a company that can solidify its reputation, product quality, customer service and customer intimacy, product innovation, technical service and value creation. Based on these variables, we believe that we compete favorably when compared with the global competition in this market.
 
Currently, our main competitors are companies providing PAA, chlorine and other sanitization solutions, such as Ozone as well as technology companies developing new biorational fungicides.
 

We also compete with heavily diversified multi-national chemical conglomerates, who produce various biocide formulations designed to kill or deactivate pathogenic micro-organisms. Of these, two companies are the most significant:
 

● | Peroxychem: Peroxychem is a subsidiary of Evonik Industries AG (Germany). It is a significant worldwide producer of hydrogen peroxide, persulfates and PAA. Peroxychem generated sales of approximately $300 million in 2019; and

● | Solvay (Belgium): Similar to Evonik Industries, Solvay is a heavily diversified multinational chemical conglomerate. During the fiscal year 2022, Solvay had approximately €13.4 billion in net sales, spread across the breadth of their product lines. Most relevant to us is their blends of PAA and hydrogen peroxide, sold in two primary formulations - OXYSTRONG for water treatment and PROXITANE for the food industry. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, we have several indirect competitors, which are companies with whom we seek to make strategic partnerships - large companies specializing in post-harvest solutions for the agricultural industry. This has been more difficult than initially anticipated due to our solutions reducing these companies’ revenues from certain fungicides used on produce. Such companies include:
 

● | Decco US Post-Harvest: Decco is a subsidiary of Decco Worldwide, which itself is a division of United Phosphorous Ltd. Decco provides a variety of solutions, both mechanical and chemical, for the post-harvest industry. They produce conventional fungicides (imazalil, thiabendizole, etc.), as well as produce coatings; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pace International: Pace International is a subsidiary of the Sumitomo Chemical Company. Similar to Decco, it provides a variety of solutions - primarily in the realm of conventional fungicides and carnauba wax coatings for fruit. 

 
We also consider Citrosol, Xeda International, JBT and Agrofresh as our indirect competitors (and current or potential collaborators).
 
The organic market offers a huge trade and income potential for producers, processors and trading companies globally. The rising demand of various organic products has driven the demand of organic post-harvest treatments. Green and organic technologies are increasingly being developed in a global market and several conventional post-harvest product and equipment suppliers, such as Citrosol, Fomesa and Peroxychem, have taken the opportunity and are starting to develop natural products.
 
Research and Development
 
In the last two years we spent an aggregate of $1,309,510 on research and development. In late 2022, our board of directors resolved to implement certain cost reduction measures, in light of the prevailing macroeconomic conditions and certain results of our operations. These cost reduction measures, included inter alia, the reduction of our budget in connection with our research and development activities and to focus mainly on the commercialization of our solutions with emphasis on converting recently completed pilots into paying customers.
 
Post-Harvest
 
During 2022, we worked on the compatibility and synergistic effect of our processing aids products SavePROTECT/PeroStar with additional post-harvest treatments used in the packing house to provide an efficient, greener and cost-effective solution.
 
In addition, we have tested a natural edible coating for microbial safety and food quality enhancement in combination with our solutions with no conclusive results so far.
 
In addition to analytical methods, we have worked first on the optimization of our delivery system and we are collaborating with an industrial engineering company to develop a new cost-effective delivery system that will be combined with the collection and transmission of data to provide users with analytics and optimization tools and increase our presence in the packing house.

Pre-Harvest – FreshProtect and our Adjuvant
 
We are also focused on developing new eco-friendly pre-harvest products which will improve post-harvest management practices by reduction of total microbial load, before even entering the packing house. An effective pre-harvest solution may reduce the need for post-harvest chemical fungicides while increasing profit through reduced spoilage in supply chains. In addition, the potential of addressing pre-harvest solution might offer new opportunities for treating crops, such as rice and wheat, with large market potential.
 
In pre-harvest application, one of the main advantages of our products is the non-toxicity of its ingredients, allowing its application up to the day of harvest (0-day pre-harvest interval), which is critical to prolonged crop protection and reduced microbial spoilage while reducing the total bacterial load entering the packing house. Field studies are conducted by Dr. James E. Adaskeveg from University of California, Riverside and the largest grower cooperative in CA in the United States on citrus trees to determine the effectiveness, optimize use protocol and effect on the environment. Additionally, in 2022, we conducted pre-harvest studies with leading Israeli citrus packers and independent mango researchers.
 
Production
 
In Israel, we work exclusively with Zohar Dalia, a reputable chemical production company. Based on our formulation and guidance, Zohar Dalia is producing our PeroStar and any other small-scale formulation that we might need for the commercialization of our solutions. Zohar Dalia is particularly regarded for its deep understanding and experience working with oxidizer like hydrogen peroxide and PAA.
 
In the United States, we work with Seeler Industries, a national leader in marketing, handling, and in the termination of hydrogen peroxide.
 
In South Africa, we began working with a local producer Auryon Industries. This producer will supply our products to our clients in Egypt and be our “backup” production site.
 
All our producers, purchase all raw materials necessary for the production of our products. All ingredients and/or raw materials that are used in the creation of our products are commodities and are readily available for purchase off the shelf.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Our products are subject to national, state and local government regulations. Based on the product claims and classification, different regulatory and registration requirements may apply at the state, provincial or federal level.


Regulation of Our Processing Aid - SavePROTECT or PeroStar
 
In the United States, our SavePROTECT product does not make any pesticidal claims and is not intended for use as a pesticide and, therefore, is not subject to the registration requirements of FIFRA. However, since the product is used on raw agricultural commodities in food processing facilities, the product is subject to regulation under the FFDCA. We believe that the product is in compliance with the FFDCA since every ingredient in the product can be considered GRAS when used as intended and the product does not have pesticidal activity per se.
 
Although SavePROTECT is not a pesticide under FIFRA, it is still required to be registered in California because the California statute requires the registration of both pesticide and adjuvant products.

On July 31, 2020, we submitted an “Application for Registration of Adjuvant” for SavePROTECT to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (the “CDPR”). The dossier submitted included the following studies: (i) acute oral toxicity and acute dermal toxicity studies, (ii) physico-chemical property testing (determination of color, physical state, odor, density, pH, viscosity and oxidation/reduction chemical incompatibility), (iii) validation of the high-performance liquid chromatography method assay, (iv) stability test, and (iv) efficacy data.
 
Based on the intended use and claims for SavePROTECT, our product was registered with CDPR on October 27, 2021 as an adjuvant.
 
In addition, based on the opinion of our U.S. regulatory experts, all SavePROTECT ingredients are GRAS when used as intended and product does not have pesticidal activity.
 
In December 2021, we submitted an application for certification for our SavePROTECT to the OMRI, an international nonprofit organization that determines which input products are allowed for use in organic production and processing. OMRI Listed® products are allowed for use in certified organic operations under the USDA National Organic Program. OMRI reviews input products to verify that they meet the organic standards for use on organic farms or in organic processing. OMRI is recognized by the USDA National Organic Program as a reputable third-party input reviewer in Interim Instruction 3012 of the NOP Handbook. In addition, OMRI is accredited under the International Organization for Standardization ISO 17065 by the USDA Quality Assessment Division.
 
In June 2022, our SavePROTECT Organic was listed by OMRI allowing us to address the certified organic industry as well.
 
In Europe, processing aids are defined as substances that are added to exert a technological function during food processing and which may end up in the finished product. According to Regulation (EC) No. 1333/2008, processing aids means any substance which (i) is not consumed as food by itself; (ii) is intentionally used in the processing of raw materials, foods or their ingredients, to fulfil a certain technological purpose during treatment or processing; and (iii) may result in the unintentional but technically unavoidable presence in the final product as residues of the substance or its derivatives, provided they do not present any health risk and do not have any technological effect on the final product.
 
Processing aids are differentiated from food additives, which are substances that are added to food with the intention to exert a technological function within the final food product. Therefore, processing aids must not follow the EFSA guideline of “Data Requirements for the Evaluation of Food Additive Applications.”
 
In Europe, our PeroStar is not considered a processing aid in the enzymatic preparation category and, therefore, PeroStar is only regulated at the national level. While there are no harmonised requirements regarding the registration of a processing aids, some data (such as full composition and some toxicological data) must be disclosed and discussed with the competent authorities before the submission of a registration request.
 
In Spain, the guidelines for precise documentation for evaluation of technological adjuvants intended to be used in human food, state specific conditions for the assessment, authorization and use of all other types of processing aids, which are not processing aids in the enzymatic preparation category. During the third quarter of 2020, we submitted a regulatory dossier as a processing aid for PeroStar in Spain and Italy with very similar information as the regulatory dossier submitted in California. In December 2022, our European regulatory consultant informed us that we satisfied the safety requirement and that no further registration is required at this time.
 
In Mexico, based on the product composition and the legal status of the substances to be used as food additives, our PeroStar/SavePROTECT can be marketed and used in Mexico as a food additive (processing aid) and no registration is required (pending the final confirmation from Mexican government).

In Israel, the guidelines of the National Food Services, Ministry of Health, define the requirements for cleaning and disinfectant agents used with food. These guidelines state that such cleaning and disinfectant agents applied to the cleaning equipment which comes into direct contact with food, must not contain carcinogens. Specifically, List A and List B published by the Inter-ministerial Committee on Carcinogens, Mutagens and Teratogens of the Ministry of Health identify products and ingredients with carcinogenic, mutagenic and teratogenic properties. Our regulatory consultant in Israel has confirmed that our PeroStar does not contain carcinogens, mutagens and/or teratogens, and, therefore, is considered approved in terms of the relevant regulations of the National Food Services, Ministry of Health, and can be used as an additive to cleaning and disinfectant agents for fresh produce.
 
On January 22, 2022, we received an approval from Peru’s Ministry of Agricultural Development and Irrigation to sell our products in Peru.
 
Registration of Our SpuDefender and FrehProtect
 
We currently have registrations for our SpuDefender (EPA Reg. No. 86381-1) and our FreshProtect (EPA Reg. No. 86381-2), at both the federal level and in the individual states where the products are sold for the use in post-harvest settings. To allow the utilization of our FreshProtect in pre-harvest settings, we submitted to EPA an updated product label in January 2023.


Regulation of Our Sanitizers - SF3H and SF3HS
 
In the United States, the primary federal laws that regulate the sale and distribution of our sanitizer products are the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”) and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”).
 
FIFRA is the federal law that regulates the sale and distribution of pesticides and is administered by the EPA. Products that claim or are otherwise intended to control microorganisms on inanimate surfaces, in water and on raw agricultural commodities are regulated, under FIFRA, as pesticides. FIFRA generally requires the pre-market registration of pesticide products. To register a pesticide product, we are required to provide test data and related information to demonstrate that the product is safe and effective under the conditions of use, as specified on the product label. The cost and timeframe to achieve EPA product registration depends on the type of product and the claims made for the product. Registered products are also subject to a number of recordkeeping and reporting obligations which require constant product oversight by companies.
 
Pursuant to FIFRA and Section 408 of the FFDCA, the EPA establishes tolerances for pesticide chemical residues that could remain in or on food, including raw agricultural commodities. A tolerance is the EPA established maximum residue level of a specific pesticide chemical that is permitted in or on a human or animal food in the United States. Generally, any pesticide chemical residue must have either a tolerance or an exemption from the requirement to have a tolerance in order to be permitted in or on human or animal food. The FDA enforces the tolerances pursuant to its authority under the FFDCA.
 
The FFDCA regulates the sale and distribution of drugs, medical devices, cosmetics and foods (including substances added to and found in food such as pesticide residues) and is administered by the FDA. Under the FFDCA, the FDA does not register or approve products that are used on food commodities and certain food-contact surfaces, such as food packaging. However, all substances that are used on food or food-contact surfaces need to be subject to an FDA regulation or permitted through other clearance mechanisms, such as a Food-Contact Notification, Threshold of Regulation opinion, by Prior Sanction or be “Generally Recognized as Safe” or “GRAS”. If all the substances or ingredients in a particular product are cleared for use on food or food-contact surfaces or are GRAS then a company can market a product without obtaining any additional clearances. GRAS substances do not require pre-market approval or clearance by the FDA although the FDA does have a notification process for GRAS substances.

At the federal level, antimicrobial agents are subject to regulation by the FDA and/or EPA, either singly or jointly, depending upon the intended use of the product. Antimicrobial products applied to processed food are solely regulated by the FDA per longstanding FDA and EPA policy outlined in an EPA Notice titled “Legal and Policy Interpretation of the Jurisdiction Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency Over the Use of Certain Antimicrobial Substances” (63 Fed. Reg. 54,532 at 54,536 & 54,541 (Oct. 9, 1998)) and EPA’s Pesticide Registration Manual, Chapter 18. Antimicrobial products applied to raw agricultural commodities (e.g. fruits and vegetables) are jointly regulated by the EPA and the FDA if their application takes place in a food-processing facility. If the antimicrobial product is applied to a raw agricultural commodity in a treatment facility that solely washes and packs food commodities, and the treatment does not change the status of the food as a raw agricultural commodity, then the EPA has sole federal regulatory jurisdiction.
 
Since our sanitizers will be and are intended to be used solely to treat raw agricultural commodities in post-harvest washing and packing facilities, at the federal level they are regulated solely by the EPA (as opposed to FDA): product registration is required under FIFRA and any food residues are regulated under the FFDCA. To complete the registration process, we will be required to submit a number of studies in the form of a registration application or dossier, which has not yet been submitted to EPA. These studies will specifically include: (i) safety studies - six acute toxicity studies (already finalized), (ii) physio-chemical properties testing (already finalized), (iii) one-year storage stability and corrosion (ongoing), and (iv) an efficacy study to demonstrate that the product is an effective sanitizer (studies conducted under non-good laboratory practices already performed and they show the product meets EPA performance standards). We have already identified and engaged with a third-party company in the United States to perform our good laboratory practices efficacy studies.
 
In addition, every state has its own laws that regulate pesticides and these laws require registration of pesticide products at the state level. Accordingly, products must also be registered in the states in which they are distributed prior to any sale.


Organizational Structure
 
As of December 31, 2022, we have one 98.48% owned subsidiary: Save Foods Ltd., which is incorporated in the State of Israel. Save Foods Ltd. is responsible for all of our commercialization of our pilots and sales activities.
Human Capital Management
 
As of March 27, 2023, we employed six full-time employees/consultants and two part-time employees. None of our employees are members of a union or subject to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. Our employees are located in Israel.
 
We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. In particular, we depend on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management. We compete for qualified personnel with other agritech companies, as well as universities and non-profit research institutions.
 
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
 
We consider our employees to be a key factor to our success and we are focused on attracting and retaining the best employees at all levels of our business. We employ people based on relevant qualifications, demonstrated skills, performance and other job-related factors. We do not tolerate unlawful discrimination related to employment and strive to ensure that employment decisions related to recruitment, selection, evaluation, compensation, and development, among others, are not influenced by race, color, religion, gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, sexual orientation, marital status, or disability. We are committed to creating a trusting environment where all ideas are welcome and employees feel comfortable and empowered to draw on their unique experiences and backgrounds.
 
We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
