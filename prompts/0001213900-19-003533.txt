Introduction
 
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on May 1, 2017 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
 
We maintain a website located at http://www.capinvestment.com. Our corporate filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K, our proxy statements and reports filed by our officers and directors under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any amendments to those filings, are available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend for information contained in our website to be a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Company History
 
In May 2017, we issued an aggregate of 10,062,500 Class B ordinary shares (“founders’ shares”) to Capitol Acquisition Management IV LLC and Capitol Acquisition Founder IV LLC (collectively, the “Sponsors”) for $25,000 in cash, at a purchase price of approximately $0.0025 per share, in connection with our organization. Our Sponsors subsequently transferred a portion of these founders’ shares to certain individuals, including our independent directors, for the same per share purchase price originally paid for such shares. The founders’ shares included an aggregate of 1,312,500 shares that were subject to forfeiture if the underwriters’ over-allotment option was not exercised in full in our initial public offering (“Offering”).
 
On August 21, 2017, we consummated the Offering of 40,250,000 units, including 5,250,000 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-third of one redeemable warrant, each whole warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share. The Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the units traded as a unit until October 6, 2017 when separate trading of Class A ordinary shares and warrants began. No fractional warrants were or will be issued and only whole warrants trade. Holders now have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component pieces. Each whole warrant entitles its holder, upon exercise, to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 subject to certain adjustments, during the period commencing 30 days after we complete an initial business combination and terminating on the five-year anniversary of the completion of our initial business combination. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $402,500,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 6,533,333 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.50 per warrant, generating total proceeds of $9,800,000. The Private Placement Warrants were purchased by our Sponsors and our directors. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in the Offering except that the Private Placement Warrants: (i) are not redeemable by us and (ii) are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or any of their permitted transferees. The purchasers of the Private Placement Warrants have also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Placement Warrants, including the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants (except to certain permitted transferees), until 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination.
 
We paid a total of $8,050,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions at the closing of the Offering (up to an additional $14,087,500 of deferred underwriting commissions may be paid upon the completion of a business combination) and $565,157 for other costs and expenses related to the Offering.


After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds to us from the Offering were approximately $393,900,000 and net proceeds from the Private Placement were $9,800,000. Of these amounts, $402,500,000 was deposited into a trust account established in connection with the Offering. We may withdraw from the trust account interest earned on the funds held therein necessary to pay our income taxes, if any, and for our working capital purposes, subject to an annual limit of $750,000. Except as described above, these funds will not be released to us until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation upon our failure to consummate a business combination within the required time period (which may not occur until August 21, 2019).

BUSINESS
 
Introduction
 
We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We are not limited to any particular industry or geographic location in selecting a target business with which to engage in a business combination.
 
We are seeking to capitalize on the extensive experience and significant contacts of our executive officers in consummating an initial business combination. Mark D. Ein, our Chief Executive Officer and the chairman of our board of directors, has over 25 years of private equity, venture capital, and public acquisition company investing experience, and L. Dyson Dryden, our President and Chief Financial Officer and a member of our board of directors, has approximately 20 years of investment banking and investing experience. Mr. Ein and Mr. Dryden are sometimes referred to herein collectively as our “founders.”
 
Mr. Ein is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Venturehouse Group, LLC, a holding company that creates, invests in, grows and builds technology, communications and related business services companies. Venturehouse was founded in 1999 to work closely with a small number of portfolio companies at any one time and to provide operational, strategic, and financing support throughout their lifecycle. Since January 2007, Mr. Ein has been the Co-Chairman and majority owner of Kastle Systems, a firm specializing in building and office security systems, which he acquired through his personal investment holding company, Leland Investments Inc. Prior to forming Venturehouse, from 1992 to 1999, Mr. Ein was a Principal with The Carlyle Group, a leading global private equity firm. Mr. Ein led many of Carlyle’s technology and telecommunications private equity investment activities. Earlier in his career, from 1989 to 1990, Mr. Ein worked for Brentwood Associates, a leading West Coast growth-focused private equity firm, and from 1986 to 1989 for Goldman, Sachs & Co.
 
Track Record with Similarly Structured Acquisition Vehicles
 
Mr. Ein and Mr. Dryden have a ten-year track record of successful execution with the following similarly structured public acquisition vehicles, the only ones our management have sponsored.
Capitol I/Two Harbors
 
Capitol Acquisition Corp., or Capitol I, was a special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial public offering in June 2007. Mr. Ein was the founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Capitol I. Capitol I completed its business combination with Two Harbors Investment Corp., or Two Harbors, in October 2009. Two Harbors was a newly formed Maryland real estate investment trust, or REIT, established to focus on residential mortgage backed securities in partnership with Pine River Capital Management L.P. Two Harbors’ common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol “TWO”. Mr. Ein served as Vice-Chairman of the board of directors of Two Harbors from October 2009 to May 2015. During Mr. Ein’s tenure as Vice-Chairman, Two Harbors completed the spin-off of Silver Bay Realty Trust, which was the first ever publicly traded single family housing REIT. Mr. Dryden served as Capitol I’s investment banker throughout the search process and assisted with the execution of the Two Harbors transaction.
Capitol II/Lindblad Expeditions
 
Capitol Acquisition Corp. II, or Capitol II, was a special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial public offering in May 2013. Mr. Ein was the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Dryden was Chief Financial Officer and Director of Capitol II. Capitol II completed its business combination with Lindblad Expeditions, Inc., or Lindblad, in July 2015. Lindblad is a global leader in expedition cruising and extraordinary travel experiences offering captivating trips featuring highly curated content to 40+ remarkable destinations on all seven continents in partnership with National Geographic. Lindblad’s merger with Capitol II enabled it to pursue attractive growth opportunities including new ship builds, expanded charters and acquisitions. Lindblad’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “LIND” and its public warrants are traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “LINDW”. Since the closing of the business combination, Mr. Ein has continued to serve as the Chairman of the Board and Mr. Dryden has continued to serve as a Director of Lindblad.
 
Capitol III/Cision
 
Capitol Acquisition Corp. III, or Capitol III, was a special purpose acquisition company that completed its initial public offering in October 2015. Mr. Ein was the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Dryden was President, Chief Financial Officer and Director of Capitol III. Capitol III completed its business combination with Canyon Holdings S.a.r.l., or Cision, in June 2017. Cision is a leading media communication technology and analytics company that enables marketers and communicators to effectively manage their earned media programs in coordination with paid and owned channels to drive business impact. As the creator of the Cision Communications Cloud™, the first-of-its-kind earned media cloud-based platform, Cision has combined cutting-edge data, analytics, technology and services into a unified communication ecosystem that brands can use to build consistent, meaningful and enduring relationships with influencers and buyers in order to amplify their marketplace influence. Cision solutions also include market-leading media technologies such as PR Newswire, Gorkana, PRWeb, Help a Reporter Out (HARO) and iContact. Cision serves over 75,000 customers in 170 countries and 40 languages worldwide, and maintains offices in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. Cision’s ordinary shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “CISN”. Since the closing of the business combination, Messrs. Ein and Dryden have continued to serve as directors of Cision.

Additionally, two of our three independent directors were directors of Capitol I, Capitol II and Capitol III and the third was a Special Advisor for Capitol I. Our executive vice president of corporate development was a member of the Capitol II and Capitol III teams, as well as an investment banker to Capitol I. The past performance of our founders and other members of our management team is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management’s performance as indicative of our future performance.
 
Acquisition Strategy
 
We employ a pro-active acquisition strategy focused on companies that have demonstrated a potential for future growth or companies for which we believe we can be the catalyst to accelerating growth. Our acquisition selection process will leverage our team’s extensive network of industry, private equity and venture capital sponsor relationships as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants who we believe should provide us with significant business combination opportunities.
 
We have identified the following criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We seek to acquire companies that we believe:
 

● | will experience substantial growth post-acquisition. We believe that we are well-positioned to evaluate a company’s current growth prospects and opportunities to enhance growth post-acquisition. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | have developed leading positions within industries that exhibit strong fundamentals. We intend to evaluate each industry and the target businesses within those industries based on several factors, including growth characteristics, competitive positioning, profitability margins and sustainability. 
● | exhibit unseen value or other characteristics that have been disregarded by the marketplace. We intend to leverage the operational experience and financial acumen of our team to focus on unlocking value others may have overlooked. 
● | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return on investment for our shareholders. We will seek to acquire the target on attractive terms. Financial returns will be evaluated based on both organic cash flow, growth potential and an ability to create value through new initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the business will be weighed against any downside risks.

 
While these criteria will be used in evaluating business combination opportunities, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business or businesses that do not meet these proposed criteria and guidelines.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
NYSE rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (net of amounts previously disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another valuation or appraisal firm that regularly renders fairness opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new ordinary or preference shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in order to consummate such transaction. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination.
 
If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions.

Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds and experience will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.
 
Financial Position
 
With the funds available in our trust account, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
Effecting a Business Combination
 
General
 
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants, the proceeds of the private sale of our shares at the time of our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
 
Our Sponsors, officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, another blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. Our Sponsors, officers and directors have agreed that if they do, they will present to us, prior to presenting to such other blank check company, all suitable business combination opportunities. Accordingly, we do not believe that the involvement in any future blank check company will affect our ability to complete an initial business combination or present a conflict of interest in determining which entity to present suitable business combination opportunities to.
 
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings.
 
4

 

These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our filings with the SEC and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our Sponsors or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee for introducing a target business to us.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsors, officers or directors, or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsors, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsors, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another valuation or appraisal firm that regularly renders fairness opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the existing management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, Sponsors, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If our initial shareholders, Sponsors, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to us to pay income taxes and for working capital (subject to an annual limit of $750,000), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is $10.00 per public share (excluding any interest earned thereon). The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our initial shareholders, which include our independent directors, have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons.
 
If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. In such case, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of our initial business combination.


6

 

If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased by them in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 15,093,751, or 37.5%, of the 40,250,000 public shares sold in the Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted). Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote, or how they vote on, the proposed transaction. 
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete our initial business combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the Offering (“Excess Shares”) without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the shares sold in the Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
 
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 
Tendering share Certificates in Connection with Exercising Redemption Rights
 
In connection with any vote held to approve a proposed business combination, public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, the need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. Accordingly, the fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares in advance of the meeting.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. If a holder of public shares delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provided that we will have until August 21, 2019 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to us to pay income taxes and for working capital (subject to an annual limit of $750,000) and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors in all cases subject to and the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period.
 
Our initial shareholders, which include our independent directors, have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination prior to August 21, 2019. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination prior to August 21, 2019.
 
Our Sponsors, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination prior to August 21, 2019, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to us, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsors, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the trust account plus the interest earned on the funds in the trust account available to us, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00.
 
We will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders. However, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver only if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.

In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our founders have agreed that they will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable); nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our founders to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our founders have sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our founders would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our founders assert that they are unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations or that they have no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our founders to enforce their indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our founders to enforce their indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share.
 

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination prior to August 21, 2019, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination prior to August 21, 2019 or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
