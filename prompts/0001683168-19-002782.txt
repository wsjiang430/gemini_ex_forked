The Company
 
Patriot Scientific Corporation (the “Company”, “PTSC”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is an intellectual-property licensing company with several patents (described below) covering the design of microprocessor chips. Chips with our patented technology are used throughout the world in products ranging from computers and cameras to printers, automobiles and industrial devices. Through our joint venture, Phoenix Digital Solutions, LLC (“PDS”), we pursue the commercialization of our patented microprocessor technologies through broad and open licensing and by litigating against those who may have infringed on our patents.
 
We are currently exploring, developing or acquiring new lines of business which at present include evaluating blockchain and artificial intelligence solutions. We are in the early stages of this effort. 
 
Our business address is 2038 Corte Del Nogal, Suite 141, Carlsbad, California 92011; our main telephone number is (760) 795-8517. Our internet website page is located at http://www.ptsc.com. All of our reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available free of charge on our internet website. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this Annual Report.
 
PTSC is a corporation organized under Delaware law on March 24, 1992, and is the successor by merger to Patriot Financial Corporation, a Colorado corporation, incorporated on June 10, 1987. In June 2005, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Technology Properties Limited, Inc. (“TPL”) to form PDS. In September 2008, we acquired Patriot Data Solutions Group, Inc. formerly known as Crossflo Systems, Inc. (“PDSG”) which engaged in data-sharing services and products primarily in the public safety/government sector. During April 2012, we sold substantially all of the assets of PDSG.
 
Our Technology
 
The global semiconductor (or silicon “chip”) market has many segments and categories. The best-known - and most profitable - of these is the microprocessor segment. Microprocessor chips are the “brains” of most electronic and electrical devices throughout the world. Although microprocessors are often closely associated with personal computers (“PCs”), PCs account for only a small fraction of the microprocessor chips made and sold every year. The vast majority of microprocessors are used in everyday items like automobiles, digital cameras, cell phones, video game players, data networks, industrial flow-control valves, sensors, medical devices, weapons, home appliances, robots, security systems, televisions, and much more. These “embedded microprocessors” (so called because they’re embedded into another product) are far more ubiquitous than the chips inside personal computers. This is the market that our technology serves.
Phoenix Digital Solutions, LLC
 
On June 7, 2005, we entered into a Master Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) with TPL, and Charles H. Moore, an individual (“Moore”). We, TPL and Moore were parties to certain lawsuits filed by us alleging infringement (the “Infringement Litigation”) of seven U.S. patents issued dating back to 1989 on our microprocessor technology (the “Microprocessor Patents”) and a lawsuit also filed by us alleging claims for declaratory judgment for determination and correction of inventorship of the Microprocessor Patents (the “Inventorship Litigation”). The transactions described in the Master Agreement and related agreements (the “Transactions”) included the settlement or dismissal of the Inventorship Litigation.
 
Pursuant to the Master Agreement we caused certain of our respective interests in the Microprocessor Patents to be licensed to PDS, a joint venture limited liability company owned 50% by us and 50% by TPL, and PDS engaged TPL to commercialize the Microprocessor Patents pursuant to a Commercialization Agreement among PDS, TPL and us (the “Commercialization Agreement”). Under the Commercialization Agreement, PDS granted to TPL the exclusive right to grant licenses and sub-licenses of the Microprocessor Patents and to pursue claims against violators of the Microprocessor Patents, in each case, on behalf of PDS, us, TPL and Moore, and TPL agreed to use reasonable best efforts to commercialize the Microprocessor Patents in accordance with a mutually agreed business plan. Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, PDS agreed to a reimbursement policy with regard to TPL’s expenses incurred in connection with the commercialization of the Microprocessor Patents. All proceeds generated by TPL in connection with the commercialization of the Microprocessor Patents were paid directly to PDS. From the inception of the Commercialization Agreement to May 31, 2019, gross license revenues to PDS totaled $312,814,535.

Pursuant to the Master Agreement, we and TPL entered into the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of PDS (“LLC Agreement”). We and TPL each own 50% of the membership interests of PDS, and each member has the right to appoint one member of the three-member management committee. The TPL and PDS appointees are required to select a mutually acceptable third member of the management committee. Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, we and TPL must each contribute to the working capital of PDS and at the discretion of PDS’s management committee we may be obligated to make future contributions in equal amounts in order to maintain a working capital fund. The LLC Agreement provides that PDS shall indemnify its members, managers, officers and employees, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, for any liabilities incurred as a result of their involvement with PDS, if the person seeking indemnification acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interest of PDS.
 
On July 11, 2012, we entered into a Licensing Program Services Agreement (the “Program Agreement”) with PDS, TPL, and Alliacense Limited, LLC (“Alliacense”, an affiliate of TPL) creating an amendment to the Commercialization Agreement, and an Agreement (the “TPL Agreement”) with TPL. Pursuant to the Program Agreement, PDS engaged Alliacense to negotiate Moore Microprocessor Patent (“MMP”) portfolio licenses and to pursue claims against violators of the MMP portfolio on behalf of PDS, TPL, and the Company. The Program Agreement extended through the useful life of the MMP portfolio patents. Pursuant to the TPL Agreement, we and TPL agreed to certain allocations of obligations in connection with the engagement of Alliacense. On July 17, 2012, we entered into an Agreement with PDS, TPL, and Alliacense whereby we agreed to certain additional allocations of obligations relating to the Program Agreement. On July 24, 2014, the Program Agreement was amended with PDS and Alliacense entering into the Amended Alliacense Services and Novation Agreement (the “Novation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Novation Agreement certain performance goals and incentives were established for Alliacense. The Novation Agreement also provided for the addition of a second licensing company, which was engaged on October 10, 2014, to complement the MMP licensing commercialization. However, Alliacense fulfilled only a portion of its obligations under the Novation Agreement associated with the deployment of the second licensing company and on May 11, 2015 Alliacense was terminated by PDS.
 
On August 10, 2016, PDS entered into an agreement with Alliacense and MMP Licensing, LLC to settle matters relating to Alliacense’s non-performance under terms of the Novation Agreement. The August 10, 2016 agreement required Alliacense to provide PDS’s second licensing company, Dominion Harbor Group (“DHG”), with certain materials and to cooperate with reasonable discovery requests relating to infringement litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. MMP Licensing, LLC will provide commercialization services to PDS for the MMP portfolio with respect to certain companies. The August 10, 2016 agreement, and the agreement retaining DHG as PDS’s second licensing company, will both expire on October 4, 2022.
 
On March 20, 2013, TPL filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On March 5, 2018, TPL’s Motion for Entry of Final Decree Closing Chapter 11 was granted.
 
In the event we are required to provide funding to PDS that is not reciprocated by TPL, our ownership percentage in PDS will increase and we will have a controlling financial interest in PDS, in which case, we will consolidate PDS in our consolidated financial statements.
 
PDS is currently pursuing a litigation strategy, which includes the intent to file a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States in regards to a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, stemming from litigation in U.S. District Court against multiple companies alleged to be infringers of the MMP portfolio. We continue to believe that the significant investment in legal effort and costs incurred to date at PDS is necessary for the protection of our interests in the MMP portfolio.
 
Licenses, Patents, Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Rights 
 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, software security measures, license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technologies. Our policy is to seek the issuance of patents that we consider important to our business to protect inventions and technology that support our microprocessor technology.
 
We have seven U.S., nine European, and three Japanese patents all of which expired between August 2009 and October 4, 2016. These patents, while expired, may have certain retrospective statutory benefits that will fully diminish six years after the patent expiration dates. The patent useful life for purposes of negotiating licenses is finite and these patents are subject to legal challenges, which in combination with the limited life, could adversely impact the stream of revenues. A successful challenge to the ownership of the technology or the proprietary nature of the intellectual property would materially damage business prospects. Any issued patent may be challenged and invalidated.

There can be no assurance that our patents will provide meaningful commercial advantages to us. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.
 
We generally require all of our employees and consultants, including our management, to sign a non-disclosure and invention assignment agreement upon employment with us.
 
Products and Services 
 
Our investment in the MMP portfolio represents virtually all of our business interests at this time. As our patents have expired, we are exploring developing or acquiring new lines of business which at present include evaluating blockchain and artificial intelligence solutions. We are in the early stages of this effort.
Employees
 
At May 31, 2019, we have one full-time and one part-time employee. We also engage consultants and part-time assistance, as needed.
 
Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our employees are not covered by key man life insurance policies.
