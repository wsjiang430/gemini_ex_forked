Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”), is a Delaware statutory trust formed on March 26, 2018, and structured as an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. On October 26, 2018, the Company elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “1940 Act”). In addition, the Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (a “RIC”) under the Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Code”).
We are externally managed by Blackstone Credit BDC Advisors LLC (the “Adviser”). Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors LP (the “Administrator” and, collectively with its affiliates in the credit-focused business of Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”), “Blackstone Credit,” which, for the avoidance of doubt, excludes Harvest Fund Advisors LLC and Blackstone Insurance Solutions) provides certain administrative and other services necessary for the Company to operate pursuant to an administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”). Blackstone Credit is part of the credit-focused platform of Blackstone and is the primary part of its "Credit & Insurance" reporting segment. 
Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We believe that Blackstone’s investment platform provides us with a competitive advantage in selecting investments, and to achieve our investment objectives, we will leverage the Adviser’s investment team’s and Blackstone’s extensive network of relationships with other sophisticated institutions to source, evaluate and, as appropriate, partner with on transactions. There are no assurances that we will achieve our investment objectives.
Under normal market conditions, we generally invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments. Our portfolio is composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans. To a lesser extent, we have and may continue to also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans and other debt and equity securities. We do not currently expect to focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other Blackstone Credit funds. As of December 31, 2022, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 97.95% first lien senior secured investments and unitranche loans, 0.48% second lien debt investments and 1.57% in equity instruments. As of December 31, 2022, 99.9% of our debt investments were floating rate in nature (93.1% of which had an interest rate floor above zero) and the weighted average yield on our income producing investments was at fair value. As of December 31, 2022 we had investments in 176 portfolio companies, with an average debt investment size in each of our portfolio companies of approximately $56.33 million based on fair value.
As a BDC, at least 70% of our assets must be the type of “qualifying” assets listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, as described herein, which are generally privately-offered securities issued by U.S. private or thinly-traded companies. We may also invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in “non-qualifying” portfolio investments, such as investments in non-U.S. companies. We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our available earnings annually by making quarterly cash distributions. We use leverage and intend to continue to use leverage for our investment activities. We use and intend to continue to use leverage, which is permitted up to the maximum amount allowed by the 1940 Act (currently limited to a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1), to enhance potential returns. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Borrowings.”
Effective on December 10, 2020, we changed our name from “Blackstone / GSO Secured Lending Fund” to “Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.”
On October 28, 2021, the Company priced its initial public offering (“IPO”), issuing 9,180,000 of its common shares of beneficial interest at a public offering price of $26.15 per share. Net of underwriting fees, the Company received net cash proceeds, before offering expenses, of $230.6 million. On November 4, 2021, the underwriters in the IPO exercised their option to purchase an additional 1,377,000 shares of common shares, which resulted in net cash proceeds, before offering expenses, of $33.8 million. The Company’s common shares began trading on the NYSE under the symbol “BXSL” on October 28, 2021.

Our Investment Adviser
Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser, a subsidiary of Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors LP, the primary investment manager for Blackstone Credit. The principal executive offices of our Adviser are located at 345 Park Avenue, 31st Floor New York, NY, 10154. Our Adviser is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.
In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of Blackstone Credit, including our Adviser and its affiliates, subject to the policies and procedures of Blackstone regarding the management of conflicts of interest. In order to source transactions, the Adviser utilizes its significant access to transaction flow, along with its trading platform. The Adviser seeks to generate investment opportunities through direct origination channels as well as through syndicate and club deals. With respect to Blackstone Credit’s origination channel, the global presence of Blackstone Credit generates access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with what we believe to be attractive investment characteristics. With respect to syndicate and club deals (i.e., where a limited number of investors participate in a loan transaction), Blackstone Credit has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. Blackstone Credit also has a significant trading platform, which, we believe, allows us access to the secondary market for investment opportunities. Blackstone Credit employs a rigorous investment process and defensive investment approach to evaluate all potential opportunities with a focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. The investment professionals employed by Blackstone Credit have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to invest in private companies. Before undertaking an investment, the Adviser’s transaction team conducts a thorough and rigorous due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the portfolio company fits our investment strategy.
Our Adviser’s investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) is responsible for reviewing and approving our investment opportunities. The Adviser’s Investment Committee review process is consensus-driven, multi-step and iterative, and occurs in parallel with the diligence and structuring of investments. Others who participate in the Investment Committee process include the team responsible for conducting due diligence, others on the investing team and other senior members of Blackstone and Blackstone Credit. There are no representatives from other business groups of Blackstone involved in the Adviser’s Investment Committee process.
We have agreed to pay our Adviser a management fee at an annual rate of 1.0% of the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. We also pay the Adviser an income based incentive fee based on our aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters. See “—Investment Advisory Agreement” for more information.
The members of the senior management and Investment Team of the Adviser serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, or of investment funds managed by the same personnel. As a result, the Adviser, its officers and employees and certain of its affiliates will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between us and other activities in which they are or may become involved, including the management of its affiliated equipment funds. See “—Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interests” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Adviser and Its Affiliates”
Our Administrator
Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors LP, a Delaware limited partnership, serves as our Administrator. The principal executive offices of our Administrator are located at 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154. We reimburse the Administrator for its costs, expenses and allocable overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) in connection with administrative services performed for us. See “—Administration Agreement.”
Blackstone Credit
Blackstone Credit is part of the credit-focused platform of Blackstone, which is the largest alternative asset manager in the world with leading investment businesses across asset classes. Blackstone’s platform provides significant competitive advantages including scale, expertise across industries and capital structures, and deep relationships with companies and financial sponsors.
Blackstone’s four business segments are real estate, private equity, credit and insurance, and hedge fund solutions. Through its different investment businesses, as of December 31, 2022, Blackstone had total assets under management of approximately $975 billion. As of December 31, 2022, Blackstone Credit’s asset management operation had aggregate assets 
Table of Contents

under management of approximately $246 billion across multiple strategies within the leveraged finance marketplace, including loans, high yield bonds, distressed and mezzanine debt and private equity, including hedge funds, and approximately $280 billion with the inclusion of Harvest and BIS. Blackstone Credit, through its affiliates, employed 518 people headquartered in New York, with offices in London, Dublin, Houston, Baltimore, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, Toronto, Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Sydney, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore as of January 1, 2023. Blackstone Credit’s 138-person private credit investment team (excluding Dwight Scott, Global Head of Blackstone Credit) is supported by a 56-person Chief Investment Office team, which consists of individuals focused on Investment Process, Portfolio Management, Asset Management, Capital Formation, Insurance Portfolios, and Data Sciences. Blackstone Credit’s Senior Managing Directors have on average 24 years of industry experience. Since inception, Blackstone Credit has originated over $149 billion in private credit transactions and during 2022, Blackstone Credit originated over $34 billion in private credit transactions. Blackstone Credit believes that the depth and breadth of its team provides it with a significant competitive advantage in sourcing product on a global basis, structuring transactions and actively managing investments in the portfolio.
Market Opportunity
We believe that there are and will continue to be significant investment opportunities in the targeted asset classes discussed below.
Attractive Opportunities in Senior Secured Loans
We believe that opportunities in senior secured loans are significant because of the strong defensive characteristics of this asset class. While there is inherent risk in investing in any securities, senior secured debt is on the top of the capital structure and thus has priority in payment among an issuer’s security holders (i.e. senior secured debt holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders). Further, these investments are secured by the issuer’s assets, which may be collateralized in the event of a default, if necessary. Senior secured debt often has restrictive covenants for the purpose of additional principal protection and ensuring repayment before junior creditors (i.e. most types of unsecured bondholders, and other security holders) and preserving collateral to protect against credit deterioration.
Opportunity in U.S. Private Companies
In addition to investing in senior secured loans generally, we believe that the market for lending to private companies, which includes middle market private companies within the United States, is underserved and presents a compelling investment opportunity. We believe that the following characteristics support our belief:
Secular Tailwinds in the Private Market, Including Private Credit. One of the important drivers of growth in the strategy is the increasing secular tailwinds in the private markets (i.e., social or economic trends positively impacting private markets), including growing demand for private credit, which has created attractive opportunities for private capital providers like Blackstone Credit. As of December 31, 2022, private equity funds with strategies focused on leveraged buyouts in North America had approximately $579.1 billion of “dry powder” (i.e., uncalled capital commitments), which should similarly drive demand for private capital providers like Blackstone Credit.1 This shift is partially due to traditional banks continuing to face regulatory limitations and retreating from the space, creating additional opportunities for private credit to take advantage of. Further, financial sponsors and companies are becoming increasingly interested in working directly with private lenders as they are seeing the tremendous benefits versus accessing the public credit markets. The Company believes some of these benefits include faster execution and greater certainty, ability to partner with sophisticated lenders, more efficient process, and in some instances fewer regulatory requirements. As a result, Blackstone Credit benefits from increasing flow of larger scale deals that have become increasingly available to direct lending universe over traditional banks and other financing institutions.
Attractive Market Segment. We believe that the underserved nature of such a large segment of the market can at times create a significant opportunity for investment. In many environments, we believe that private companies are more likely to offer attractive economics in terms of transaction pricing, up-front and ongoing fees, prepayment penalties and security features in the form of stricter covenants and quality collateral than loans to public companies.
Limited Investment Competition. Despite the size of the market, we believe that regulatory changes and other factors have diminished the role of traditional financial institutions and certain other capital providers in providing financing to companies. As tracked by Leverage Commentary & Data (LCD), private credit markets financed 274 leveraged buyouts (“LBO”) (83% of total LBOs in 2022) compared to the publicly syndicated markets, which financed only 56 (17% of total LBOs in 2022). In addition, due to bank consolidation, the number of banks has also rapidly declined, furthering the lack of

supply in financing to private companies. As of July 2020, there were approximately 4,375 banks in the U.S., which was only one-third of the number of banks in 1984, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data.
We also believe that lending and originating new loans to private companies generally requires a greater dedication of the lender’s time and resources compared to lending to public companies, due in part to the size of each investment and the often fragmented nature of information available from these companies. Further, we believe that many investment firms lack the breadth and scale necessary to identify investment opportunities, particularly in regards to directly originated investments in private companies, and thus attractive investment opportunities are often overlooked. 
Blackstone Credit Strengths
Blackstone Credit is one of the largest private credit investment platforms globally and a key player in the direct lending space. Blackstone Credit has experience scaling funds across its platform that invest throughout all parts of the capital structure. Blackstone Credit strives to focus on transactions where it can differentiate itself from other providers of capital, targeting large transactions and those where Blackstone Credit can bring its expertise and experience in negotiating and structuring. We believe that Blackstone Credit has the scale and platform to effectively manage a U.S. private credit investment strategy, offering investors the following potential strengths:
Ability to Provide Scale, Differentiated Capital Solutions. We believe that the breadth and scale of Blackstone Credit’s approximately $246 billion platform, as of December 31, 2022, and affiliation with Blackstone are distinct strengths when sourcing proprietary investment opportunities and provide Blackstone Credit with a differentiated capability to invest in large, complex opportunities. Blackstone Credit is invested in over 3,100 corporate issuers across its portfolios globally and has focused primarily on the non-investment grade corporate credit market since its inception in 2005. Blackstone Credit expects that in the current environment, in which committed capital from banks remains scarce, the ability to provide flexible, well-structured capital commitments in appropriate sizes will enable Blackstone Credit to command more favorable terms for its investments. Blackstone Credit seeks to generate investment opportunities through its direct origination channels and through syndicate and club deals (generally, investments made by a small group of investment firms). With respect to Blackstone Credit’s origination channel, we seek to leverage the global presence of Blackstone Credit to generate access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with attractive investment characteristics. We believe that the broad network of Blackstone Credit provides a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us. With respect to syndicate and club deals, Blackstone Credit has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. Blackstone Credit also has a significant trading platform, which, we believe, allows us access to the secondary market for investment opportunities.
Established Origination Platform with Strong Credit Expertise. As of December 31, 2022, Blackstone Credit employed 518 people headquartered in New York, with offices in London, Dublin, Houston, Baltimore, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, Toronto, Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Sydney, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore as of January 1, 2023. Blackstone Credit’s 138-person private credit investment team (excluding Dwight Scott, Global Head of Blackstone Credit) is supported by a 56-person Chief Investment Office team, which consists of individuals focused on Investment Process, Portfolio Management, Asset Management, Capital Formation, Insurance Portfolios, and Data Sciences. Blackstone Credit’s Senior Managing Directors have on average 24 years of industry experience. Since inception, Blackstone Credit has originated over $149 billion in private credit transactions and during 2022, Blackstone Credit originated over $34 billion in private credit transactions. We believe that Blackstone Credit’s strong reputation and longstanding relationships with corporate boards, management teams, leveraged buyout sponsors, financial advisors, and intermediaries position Blackstone Credit as a partner and counterparty of choice and provides us with attractive sourcing capabilities. In Blackstone Credit’s experience, these relationships help drive substantial proprietary deal flow and insight into investment opportunities.
Blackstone Credit believes that having one team responsible for alternatives private origination allows us to leverage the strengths and experiences of investment professionals to deliver the leading financing solutions to our companies. The team has operated through multiple industry cycles, with deep credit expertise, providing them valuable experience and a long-term view of the market. The team is also focused on making investments in what are characterized as “good neighborhoods,” which

are industries experiencing favorable tailwinds, such as life sciences, software & technology, and renewable energy. In addition, the team is able to leverage the expertise of other parts of Blackstone’s business that specialize in these fields.
Additionally, over the last several years, Blackstone Credit has also expanded its U.S. origination and sponsor coverage footprint with regional offices opened in select markets. Blackstone Credit has investment professionals across the U.S. and Europe and has developed a reputation for being a valued partner, with the ability to provide speed, creativity, and assurance of transaction execution. We believe that establishing this regional presence in the U.S. may help us more effectively source investment opportunities from mid-sized leveraged buyout sponsors as well as direction from companies, while potentially strengthening the Blackstone Credit brand.
Value-Added Capital Provider and Partner Leveraging the Blackstone Credit Advantage Program. Blackstone Credit has established a reputation for providing creative, value-added solutions to address a company’s financing requirements and believes our ability to solve a need for a company can lead to attractive investment opportunities. In addition, Blackstone Credit has access to the significant resources of the Blackstone platform, including the Blackstone Advantage Program (“Blackstone Advantage”), which refers to the active management of the Blackstone portfolio company network, including cross-selling efforts across all of Blackstone, and aims to ensure practice sharing, operational, and commercial synergies among portfolio companies, effective deployment of Blackstone resources, and communication of the program with businesses and partners, and the Blackstone Credit Advantage Program (“Blackstone Credit Advantage”), which is a global platform that provides access to a range of cost saving, revenue generating and best practice sharing opportunities. Specifically, Blackstone Credit Advantage provides (i) partnership and best practices for portfolio companies by offering invaluable access to industry and function experts both within the Blackstone organization (including the Blackstone Portfolio Operations team) and the network among portfolio companies; (ii) cross selling opportunities across Blackstone and Blackstone Credit portfolio companies; (iii) industry knowledge via leadership summits and roundtables; and (iv) quarterly reports sharing meaningful insights from CEOs on business and economic trends. Finally, one of the most important benefits of the program is Blackstone’s GPO, which is a collective purchasing platform that leverages the scale and buying power of the $5.9 billion of estimated total spending of Blackstone’s portfolio companies with strategic partners and vendors measured over the past 10+ years. Blackstone and Blackstone Credit portfolio companies have generated significant cost savings through their use of the GPO, up to 40%, often from existing suppliers, on maintenance, repair, operations, back office, information technology, hardware, software, telecommunications, business insurance and human resources, among others. The benefits of working with Blackstone’s GPO can include improved pricing and terms, differentiated service, and ongoing service that drops straight to the bottom line. As of December 31, 2022, Blackstone Advantage has grown revenue by over $500 million for Blackstone portfolio companies and Blackstone Credit Advantage has reduced annual costs by $249 million. The dedicated Blackstone Credit operational program provides support to portfolio companies and has created approximately $3 billion in value.4 Blackstone Advantage has 112 internal Blackstone resources available to our portfolio companies as of December 31, 2022. 
Flexible Investment Approach. Blackstone Credit believes that the ability to invest opportunistically throughout a capital structure is a meaningful strength when sourcing transactions and enables the Company to seek investments that provide the best risk/return proposition in any given transaction. Blackstone Credit’s creativity and flexibility with regard to deal-structuring distinguishes it from other financing sources, including traditional mezzanine providers, whose investment mandates are typically more restrictive. Over time, Blackstone Credit has demonstrated the ability to negotiate favorable terms for its investments by providing creative structures that add value for an issuer. Blackstone Credit will continue to seek to use this flexible investment approach to focus on principal preservation, while generating attractive returns throughout different economic and market cycles.
Long-Term Investment Horizon. Our long-term investment horizon gives us great flexibility, which we believe allows us to maximize returns on our investments. Unlike most private equity and venture capital funds, as well as many private debt funds, we will not be required to return capital to our shareholders once we exit a portfolio investment. We believe that freedom from such capital return requirements, which allows us to invest using a long-term focus, provides us with an attractive opportunity to increase total returns on invested capital.
Disciplined Investment Process and Income-Oriented Investment Philosophy. Blackstone Credit employs a rigorous investment process and defensive investment approach to evaluate all potential opportunities with a focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. We believe Blackstone Credit has generated attractive risk-adjusted returns in its investing activities throughout many economic and credit cycles by (i) maintaining its investment discipline; (ii) performing intensive credit work; (iii) carefully structuring transactions; and (iv) actively managing its portfolios. Blackstone Credit’s investment approach involves a multi-stage selection process for each investment opportunity, as well as ongoing monitoring of each investment made, with particular emphasis on early detection of deteriorating credit conditions at portfolio companies,

which would result in adverse portfolio developments. This strategy is designed to maximize current income and minimize the risk of capital loss while maintaining the potential for long-term capital appreciation. Additionally, Blackstone Credit’s senior investment professionals have dedicated their careers to the leveraged finance and private equity sectors and we believe that their experience in due diligence, credit analysis and ongoing management of investments is invaluable to the success of the U.S. direct lending investment strategy. Blackstone Credit generally targets businesses with leading market share positions, sustainable barriers to entry, high free cash flow generation, strong asset values, liquidity to withstand market cycles, favorable underlying industry trends, strong internal controls and high-quality management teams.
Strong Investment Track Record. Blackstone Credit’s track record in private debt lending and investing in below investment grade credit dates back to the inception of Blackstone Credit. Since 2005 through December 31, 2022, Blackstone Credit has provided approximately $149 billion in capital in privately-originated transactions. Blackstone Credit has approximately $170 billion of investor capital currently deployed.
Efficient Cost Structure. We believe that we have an efficient cost structure, as compared to other publicly traded BDCs, with low management fees, expenses, and financing costs. We believe our operating efficiency and senior investment strategy enable us to generate greater risk-adjusted investment returns for our investors relative to other publicly traded BDCs.
Scale. Scale allows for more resources to source, diligence and monitor investments, and enables us to move up market where there is often less competition.
Investment Strategy
Our investment objectives are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. We seek to meet our investment objectives by:
•utilizing the experience and expertise of the management team of the Adviser, along with the broader resources of Blackstone Credit, which include its access to the relationships and human capital of Blackstone Credit’s parent, Blackstone, in sourcing, evaluating and structuring transactions, subject to Blackstone’s policies and procedures regarding the management of conflicts of interest;
•employing a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection, generally lending on what the Adviser believes are (i) protective multiples of the borrower’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) to its interest coverage obligations, (ii) conservative loan-to-value ratios and (iii) favorable financial covenant protections;
•focusing primarily on loans and securities of private U.S. companies, including syndicated loans, specifically small and middle market companies. In many market environments, we believe such a focus offers an opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns;
•maintaining rigorous portfolio monitoring in an attempt to anticipate and pre-empt negative credit events within our portfolio; and
•utilizing the power and scale of Blackstone and the Blackstone Credit platform to offer operational expertise to portfolio companies through the Blackstone Credit Advantage Program.
Under normal market conditions, we generally invest at least 80% of our total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in secured debt investments (including investments that are secured by equity interests). Our portfolio is composed primarily of first lien senior secured and unitranche loans (including first out/last out loans). To a lesser extent, we have and may continue to also invest in second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans and other debt and equity securities. We do not currently focus on investments in issuers that are distressed or in need of rescue financing. Subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, we may invest in loans or other securities the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other Blackstone Credit funds.
Includes invested and committed capital for privately originated and anchor investments across private credit strategies and vehicles since 2005, including Direct Lending, Sustainable Resources, Mezzanine, and Opportunistic. Excludes liquid credit strategy investments. 
As of December 31, 2022. Investor capital deployed as of December 31, 2022, consists of fee earning AUM of $97 billion for Liquid Credit Strategies and $73 billion for Private Credit and other liquid funds (inclusive of leverage).
Table of Contents

Although we do not expect a significant portion of our portfolio to be composed of second lien, third lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, there is no limit on the amount of such loans in which we may invest, subject to compliance with our 80% policy. We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, including investments in senior secured bonds, through secondary market transactions in the “over-the-counter” market or directly from our target companies as primary market, directly originated or syndicated investments. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive equity interests such as warrants or options as additional consideration. We have and may continue to also purchase or otherwise acquire minority interests in the form of common or preferred equity or equity-related securities, such as rights and warrants that may be converted into or exchanged for our common shares or other equity or the cash value of shares or other equity, in our target companies, generally in conjunction with one of our debt investments or through a co-investment with a financial sponsor, such as an institutional investor or private equity firm, or a finance company transaction (such as a joint venture). In addition, a portion of our portfolio may be composed of unsecured bonds, CLOs, other debt securities and derivatives, including total return swaps and credit default swaps. Depending on market conditions, we may increase or decrease our exposure to less senior portions of the capital structure or otherwise make opportunistic investments.
Investment Selection
When identifying prospective investment opportunities, the Adviser currently intends to rely on fundamental credit analysis in order to minimize the loss of the Company’s capital. The Adviser expects to invest in companies possessing the following attributes, which it believes will help achieve our investment objectives:
Leading, Defensible Market Positions. The Adviser intends to invest in companies that it believes have developed strong positions within their respective markets and exhibit the potential to maintain sufficient cash flows and profitability to service their obligations in a range of economic environments. The Adviser will seek companies that it believes possess advantages in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing, or product quality versus their competitors, thereby minimizing business risk and protecting profitability.
Proven Management Teams. The Adviser focuses on investments in which the target company has an experienced and high-quality management team with an established track record of success. The Adviser typically requires companies to have in place proper incentives to align management’s goals with the Company’s goals.
Private Equity Sponsorship. Often the Adviser seeks to participate in transactions sponsored by what it believes to be high-quality private equity firms. The Adviser believes that a private equity sponsor’s willingness to invest significant sums of equity capital into a company is an implicit endorsement of the quality of the investment. Further, private equity sponsors of companies with significant investments at risk generally have the ability and a strong incentive to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should operational issues arise, which could provide additional protections for our investments.
Diversification. The Adviser seeks to invest broadly among companies and industries, thereby potentially reducing the risk of a downturn in any one company or industry having a disproportionate impact on the value of the Company’s portfolio.
Viable Exit Strategy. In addition to payments of principal and interest, we expect the primary methods for the strategy to realize returns on our investments include refinancings, sales of portfolio companies, and in some cases initial public offerings and secondary offerings. While many debt instruments in which we will invest have stated maturities of five to eight years, we expect the majority to be redeemed or sold prior to maturity. These instruments often have call protection that requires an issuer to pay a premium if it redeems in the early years of an investment. The Investment Team regularly reviews investments and related market conditions in order to determine if an opportunity exists to realize returns on a particular investment. We believe the ability to utilize the entire resources of Blackstone Credit, including the public market traders and research analysts, allows the Adviser to gain access to current market information where the opportunity may exist to sell positions into the market at attractive prices.
Investment Process Overview
Our investment activities are managed by our Adviser. The Adviser is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis.
Table of Contents

The investment professionals employed by Blackstone Credit have spent their careers developing the resources necessary to invest in private companies. Our transaction process is highlighted below.
Sourcing and Origination
In order to source transactions, the Adviser utilizes its significant access to transaction flow, along with its trading platform. The Adviser seeks to generate investment opportunities primarily through direct origination channels, and also through syndicate and club deals. With respect to Blackstone Credit’s origination channel, the global presence of Blackstone Credit generates access to a substantial amount of directly originated transactions with what we believe to be attractive investment characteristics. With respect to syndicate and club deals, Blackstone Credit has built a network of relationships with commercial and investment banks, finance companies and other investment funds as a result of the long track record of its investment professionals in the leveraged finance marketplace. We believe that Blackstone Credit’s strong reputation and longstanding relationships with its broad network will help drive substantial proprietary deal flow and provide a significant pipeline of investment opportunities for us.
Evaluation
Initial Review. The Investment Team examines information furnished by the target company and external sources, including banks, advisors and rating agencies, if applicable, to determine whether the investment meets our basic investment criteria within the context of proper allocation of our portfolio among various issuers and industries, and offers an acceptable probability of attractive returns with identifiable downside risk. In the case of directly originated transactions, Blackstone Credit conducts detailed due diligence investigations. For the majority of securities available on the secondary market, a comprehensive analysis is conducted and continuously maintained by a dedicated Blackstone Credit research analyst, the results of which are available for the transaction team to review.
Credit Analysis/Due Diligence. Before undertaking an investment, the Investment Team conducts a thorough and rigorous due diligence review of the opportunity to ensure the company fits our investment strategy for originated investments, which may include. but are not limited to: 
•a full operational analysis to identify the key risks and opportunities of the target’s business, including a detailed review of historical and projected financial results;
•a detailed analysis of industry and customer dynamics, competitive position, regulatory, tax, legal and environmental, social and governance matters;
•on-site visits and customer and supplier reference calls, if deemed necessary;
•background checks to further evaluate management and other key personnel;
•a review by legal and accounting professionals, environmental or other industry consultants, if necessary;
•financial sponsor due diligence, including portfolio company and lender reference checks, if necessary; and
•a review of management’s experience and track record.
Third parties are often involved in the Adviser’s due diligence process, whether they are hired by the Adviser or by the lead sponsor in a transaction. Utilizing consultants to help evaluate a business and test an investment thesis is typically very beneficial. When possible, the Adviser seeks to structure transactions in such a way that our target companies are required to bear the costs of due diligence, including those costs related to any outside consulting work we may require.
The foregoing initial assessment is then followed by extensive credit analysis, including asset valuation, financial analysis, cash flow analysis and scenario analysis, legal and accounting review, and comparable credit and equity analyses. A thorough assessment of structure and leverage of a transaction and how the particular investment fits into the overall investment strategy of the portfolio is conducted. Blackstone Credit’s typical diligence process for an originated investment opportunity spans two to six months, from the initial screen through final approval and funding. Depending on the deal, each investment

team typically consists of three to four investment professionals, consisting of a portfolio manager, managing director, principal or vice president and associate and/or analyst.
Blackstone Credit’s due diligence emphasizes the following key criteria to facilitate decisions by the Investment Committee (described below) on an investment:
•Valuation: What is the intrinsic value of the business? How has the business historically generated returns on capital? Will these returns continue in the future? What growth opportunities does the business have, if any? And, most importantly, is the investment being purchased at a deep discount to long-term intrinsic value?
•Return Hurdles: Is the investment expected to generate a rate of return that meets the Company's objectives?
•Risk of Principal Loss & Risk/Reward: What is the expected recovery in a severe downside case? Does the expected upside appropriately compensate for risk of loss?
•Company Analysis: Does the business have a reason to exist? Does it provide needed products and services? Does it have strong business characteristics such as high relative market share and a defensible niche?
•Industry Analysis: What is the expected time and depth of cyclical downturn? Is the distress related to cyclical or secular issues? Is there a favorable industry structure with respect to customers, suppliers and regulation?
•Due Diligence: Do we have sufficient information to make an informed investment decision? 
•Catalyst: What steps are required to complete a reorganization, eliminate financial distress, gain control and implement improved business strategies?
•Exit Plan: Do we expect refinancings, a sale of the company, or other exit opportunities?
Investment Committee Process. The Investment Committee review process is multi-step and iterative, and occurs in parallel with the diligence and structuring of investments. The initial investment screening process involves an Investment Committee heads-up (the “Heads-Up”) review presentation by the portfolio manager and members of the investment team. The Heads-Up review involves the production of a short memo with a focus on the following diligence items: an early diligence review of the underlying business fundamentals; expected return potential; expected investment size; assessment of key risks; and an appropriate initial diligence plan. At this point in the decision-making process, the Investment Committee will decide whether or not the Investment Team should proceed with deeper diligence on the investment opportunity.
Once in-depth diligence has begun, the investment team presents updates at the weekly Investment Committee meetings. The senior team reviews all activity for the prior week, with a focus on detailed updates of ongoing situations and in-depth review of all new investment opportunities. The type of diligence materials reviewed at these meetings for each company may include, but are not limited to:
•Detailed historical financial performance
•Financial models with detailed revenue drivers 
◦This includes the construction of a base case, a downside case and specifically tailored cases. This process includes probability-weighted analysis and a range of outcomes analysis.
•Quarterly liquidity analyses
•Industry analysis incorporating internal and external work from research analysts and industry consultants
•Competitive position and market share analysis
•Customer analysis, including revenue, profitability and concentration risk
•Pricing and volume analyses
•Detailed fixed vs. variable cost analysis, and line item analysis of cost of goods sold as well as selling, general and administrative expenses
•Public and private credit and equity comparable analysis
Table of Contents

•Accounting quality of earnings analysis
•Legal due diligence
The ultimate results and findings of the investment analysis are compiled in comprehensive investment memoranda that are used as the basis to support the investment thesis and are utilized by the Investment Committee (or the applicable delegates or sub-committees as described below) for final investment review and approval. Each investment requires the consent of the Investment Committee, which may emphasize the following key criteria (among others) in making a decision:
•Company Analysis: Does the company meet the investment criteria defined by the “Blackstone Credit Scorecard”?:
◦Leading market share position
◦Sustainable barriers to entry that drive pricing power
◦High-quality management team
◦Stable financials: strong free cash flow generation, high earnings before interest and tax margins
◦Conservative capital structure with underlying equity value
◦Liquidity to withstand market cycles
•Industry Analysis: Is there a favorable industry structure with respect to customers, suppliers and regulation?
•Due Diligence: Have we fully diligenced each of the investment criteria specified by the Blackstone Credit Scorecard? Have we completely vetted each of the risk factors identified throughout the diligence and Investment Committee process?
•Valuation: What is the intrinsic value of the business? How has the business historically generated returns on capital? Will these returns continue in the future? What growth opportunities does the business have, if any? Is there substantial equity value to support the capital structure?
•Risk of Principal Loss & Risk/Reward: What is the expected recovery in a severe downside case? Does the expected upside appropriately compensate for risk of loss?
•Return Hurdles: Is the investment expected to generate a rate of return that meets the Company’s objectives?
•Exit Plan: Do we expect refinancings, a sale of the company, or other exit opportunities?
The Investment Committee utilizes a consensus-driven approach and currently consists of the following senior investment professionals: Dwight Scott, Brad Marshall, Robert Zable, Michael Zawadzki, Dan Smith, Rob Horn, Rob Petrini, Louis Salvatore and Paulo Eapen. Others who participate in the Investment Committee process include the members of the Investment Team responsible for sourcing, analyzing and conducting due diligence on the investment and other senior members of Blackstone Credit. For certain investments, generally smaller investments where the Company is participating alongside other lenders in a “club” deal, providing an anchor order or purchasing broadly syndicated loans, the Investment Committee has delegated the authority to make an investment decision to a sub-committee of the full Investment Committee. For broadly syndicated loan investments made by the Company alongside funds within Blackstone Credit’s Liquid Credit Strategies, the portfolio managers of the Company may conduct a joint investment committee with the Liquid Credit Strategies business that follows the investment committee process for the Liquid Credit Strategies business in lieu of the Investment Committee process described above. There are no representatives from other business groups of Blackstone involved in the Company’s Investment Committee process.
Monitoring
Portfolio Monitoring. Active management of our investments is performed by the team responsible for making the initial investment. The Adviser believes that actively managing an investment allows the Investment Team to identify problems early and work with companies to develop constructive solutions when necessary. The Adviser will monitor our portfolio with a focus toward anticipating negative credit events. In seeking to maintain portfolio company performance and help to ensure a successful exit, the Adviser will work closely with, as applicable, the lead equity sponsor, loan syndicator, portfolio company management, consultants, advisers and other security holders to discuss financial position, compliance with covenants, financial requirements and execution of the company’s business plan. In addition, depending on the size, nature and performance of the 
Table of Contents

transaction, we may occupy a seat or serve as an observer on a portfolio company’s board of directors or similar governing body.
Watch List. Typically for its portfolio companies, Blackstone Credit establishes at closing a number of reporting and management tools. These tools include regular reporting on portfolio composition and reporting, calls with CEOs and detailed reports and calls with senior management on a regular basis, and quarterly in-person board meetings and board presentations. All reports and presentations are designed with Blackstone Credit input based on its past experience with private investments. These tools allow Blackstone Credit to identify problems quickly and work to fix them before they impair an investment. In addition, Blackstone Credit maintains a “watch list” for each business under-performing its expectations. Blackstone Credit seeks to approach each situation with the view that working closely with senior management and the shareholders of the company on strategies to remedy problems will ultimately maximize value realization. When, in order to maximize our recovery, Blackstone Credit is forced to take positions inconsistent with the company’s shareholders, Blackstone Credit expects to act quickly to enforce its rights.
Blackstone Credit strives to position itself to be able to identify and manage the process surrounding a troubled portfolio company. When companies under-perform, Blackstone Credit generally increases its involvement in the business and works closely with senior management to develop plans to help get performance on track. Blackstone Credit will request more information and will enhance our information quality so that we are aware of any developments. Blackstone Credit’s Investment Committee process is designed to identify red flags of a potential opportunity early and to leverage the collective knowledge of its prior experiences. Blackstone Credit believes that vetting all investments through its Investment Committee, which has deep expertise across industries, differentiates Blackstone Credit and can help it avoid mistakes. Additionally, Blackstone Credit may provide guidance on key management hires or supplement the portfolio company’s board with relevant industry people that Blackstone Credit has worked with previously to engage more deeply in the operations of a portfolio company. Additionally, the GPO team can be leveraged to help reduce costs and augment key leadership positions.
Default/Workout. An important element of Blackstone Credit’s strategy for originated investments is to attempt to structure investments in a manner such that Blackstone Credit will control negotiations should an issuer violate covenants or need to restructure its balance sheet. Blackstone Credit believes that this is typically achieved by ensuring that an investment is at or above the “fulcrum” security, if a restructuring were to occur. A fulcrum security is the security in a company’s capital structure that, if the company were to be liquidated, would be partially repaid. Generally, securities more senior than the fulcrum security would typically be fully repaid in such a liquidation and securities more junior than the fulcrum security would typically receive no recovery in a liquidation. If an investment should default, Blackstone Credit believes it has ample resources necessary to take a company through a restructuring, as many of its investment professionals have restructuring backgrounds.
The Blackstone Credit deal team, along with other creditors and outside counsel, will be responsible for monitoring any defaulting portfolio companies and driving the restructuring processes thereafter. The same Investment Team members who originate an investment remain actively involved, from sourcing through diligence, execution and ongoing management all the way to exit. In the case that an investment requires a heavy workout that results in a board seat and more operational involvement, Blackstone Credit may dedicate or add a senior investment professional to solely focus on the workout situation. This individual will get involved and run the full workout process to allow the other deal team members to focus on new origination and other portfolio companies. Any investment undergoing a workout will also be discussed with portfolio management and the Investment Committee on a regular basis.
Valuation Process. Each quarter, we will value investments in our portfolio, and such values will be disclosed each quarter in reports filed with the SEC. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, a valuation committee appointed by the Board of Trustees will assist the Board of Trustees in determining the fair value of such investments in good faith, based on procedures adopted by and subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees.
Managerial Assistance. As a BDC, we must offer, and provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies except where the Company purchases securities of an issuer in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance, including through the Blackstone Credit Advantage program. The Adviser and the Administrator will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. To the extent fees are paid for these services, we, rather than the Adviser, will retain any fees paid for such assistance.

Exit
In addition to payments of principal and interest, we expect the primary methods for the strategy to realize returns on its investments include refinancings, sales of portfolio companies, and in some cases initial public offerings and secondary offerings. While many debt securities in which we will invest have stated maturities of five to eight years, based on Blackstone Credit’s past experience, we believe most of these securities will be redeemed or sold prior to maturity. These securities often have call protection that requires an issuer to pay a premium if it redeems in the early years of an investment. However, there is no assurance that our investments will achieve realization events as a result of refinancings, sales of portfolio companies or public offerings and these realization events will become more unlikely when conditions in the loan and capital markets have deteriorated.
The Investment Team regularly reviews investments and related market conditions in order to determine if an opportunity exists to realize returns on a particular investment. We believe the Adviser’s ability to utilize the entire resources of Blackstone Credit, including the public market traders and research analysts, allows the Adviser to gain access to current market information where the opportunity may exist to sell positions into the market at attractive prices.
Allocation of Investment Opportunities and Potential Conflicts of Interest
Blackstone Credit, including the Adviser, provides investment management services to other registered investment companies, investment funds, client accounts and proprietary accounts that Blackstone Credit may establish (other than the Company) (collectively the “Other Blackstone Credit Clients”). In addition, Blackstone provides investment management services to other registered investment companies, investment funds, client accounts and proprietary accounts that Blackstone may establish (together with the Other Blackstone Credit Clients, the “Other Clients”). See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Adviser and Its Affiliates—There may be conflicts of interest related to obligations that the Adviser’s senior management and Investment Team have to other clients.”
Blackstone Credit will share any investment and sale opportunities with its other clients and the Company in accordance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act") and firm-wide allocation policies, which generally provide for sharing pro rata based on targeted acquisition size or targeted sale size. Subject to the Advisers Act and as further set forth in this annual report, certain other clients may receive certain priority or other allocation rights with respect to certain investments, subject to various conditions set forth in such other clients’ respective governing agreements.
In addition, as a BDC regulated under the 1940 Act, the Company is subject to certain limitations relating to co-investments and joint transactions with affiliates, which likely in certain circumstances limit the Company’s ability to make investments or enter into other transactions alongside other clients.
Co-Investment Relief
We have in the past co-invested, and in the future may co-invest, with certain affiliates of the Adviser. We have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions. Pursuant to such order, the board of trustees of the Company (the “Board”) has established objective criteria (“Board Criteria”) clearly defining co-investment opportunities in which the Company will have the opportunity to participate with one or more listed or private Blackstone Credit-managed BDCs (including the Company, the “Blackstone Credit BDCs”), and other public or private Blackstone Credit funds that target similar assets. If an investment falls within the Board Criteria, Blackstone Credit must offer an opportunity for the Blackstone Credit BDCs to participate. The Blackstone Credit BDCs may determine to participate or not to participate, depending on whether Blackstone Credit determines that the investment is appropriate for the Blackstone Credit BDCs (e.g., based on investment strategy). The co-investment would generally be allocated to us, any other Blackstone Credit BDCs and the other Blackstone Credit funds that target similar assets pro rata based on available capital in the applicable asset class. We generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent trustees make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objectives and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing. If the Adviser determines that such investment is not appropriate for us, the investment will not be allocated to us, but the Adviser will be required to report such investment and the rationale for its determination for us to not participate in the investment to the Board at the next quarterly board meeting.

Investments
As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of our investments was $9,617 million and $9,855 million, respectively, in 176 and 148 portfolio companies, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the Company had unfunded delayed draw terms loans and revolvers in the aggregate principal amount of $690.3 million and $1,407.3 million, respectively.
See the Consolidated Schedule of Investments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 in our consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Consolidated Schedule of Investments” for more information on these investments.
Capital Resources and Borrowings
As a RIC, we intend to distribute substantially all of our investment company taxable income (“ICTI”) (as that term is defined in the Code, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid) to our shareholders. We anticipate generating cash in the future from the issuance of shares and cash flows from operations, including interest received on our debt investments.
Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company’s asset coverage was 174.8% and 180.2%, respectively.
Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must take provisions to prohibit any distribution to our shareholders (which may cause us to fail to distribute amounts necessary to avoid entity-level taxation under the Code), or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In addition, we must also comply with positive and negative covenants customary for these types of facilities. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Investment Advisory Agreement
The Adviser provides management services to us pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Investment Advisory Agreement has been approved by the Board. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for the following:
•determining the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes in accordance with our investment objectives, policies and restrictions;
•identifying investment opportunities and making investment decisions for us, including negotiating the terms of investments in, and dispositions of, portfolio securities and other instruments on our behalf;
•monitoring our investments;
•performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies;
•exercising voting rights in respect of portfolio securities and other investments for us;
•serving on, and exercising observer rights for, boards of directors and similar committees of our portfolio companies;
•negotiating, obtaining and managing financing facilities and other forms of leverage; and
•providing us with such other investment advisory and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of capital.
The Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities, and it intends to do so, so long as its services to us are not impaired.
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay our Adviser a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components: a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders.
Table of Contents

Management Fees
The management fee is payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate 1.0% (which rate was 0.75% prior to the IPO) of the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, “gross assets” means our total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), excluding undrawn commitments but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts. For the quarter in which the IPO occurred, the management fee shall be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after the IPO based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after the IPO.
In order to maintain the same management fee arrangement that the Company had in place prior to the IPO for a period of time following the IPO, the Adviser voluntarily waived its right to receive the base management fee in excess of 0.75% of the average value of the Company’s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters from the date of consummation of the IPO through the two year anniversary of the consummation of the IPO (the “Waiver Period”). As a result of the fee waiver, the pre-listing management fee and incentive fee rates paid by the Company to the Adviser will not increase during the Waiver Period. Amounts waived by the Adviser are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. 
Incentive Fees
The incentive fees consists of two components that are determined independently of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. One component of the incentive fee is based on our income and the other component is based on of our capital gains, each as described below.
(i) Income based incentive fees
The first part of the incentive fees is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns” means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement entered into between us and the Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”), and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee).
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The Company excludes the impact of expense support payments and recoupments from pre-incentive fee net investment income.
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a “hurdle rate” of return of 1.5% per quarter (6.0% annualized).
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company is required to pay an income based incentive fee of 15% prior to the consummation of the IPO and 17.5% following the consummation of the IPO, with a 1.5% hurdle and 100% catch-up. However, the Adviser has implemented a voluntary waiver with respect to the income based incentive fee. The Adviser has voluntarily waived its right to receive an income based incentive fee above 15% during the Waiver Period.
The Company pays its Adviser an income based incentive fee based on its aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income, as adjusted as described above, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (such period, the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”).
The hurdle amount for the income based incentive fee will be determined on a quarterly basis and is equal to 1.5% multiplied by the Company’s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for issuances by the Company of common shares, including issuances pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The income based incentive fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated.
Table of Contents

For the income based incentive fee, the Company will pay the Adviser a quarterly incentive fee based on the amount by which (A) aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the “Excess Income Amount.”
The income based incentive fee for each quarter will be determined as follows:
•No income based incentive fee is payable to the Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount;
•The Adviser will be paid 100% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters, but is less than or equal to an amount, which we refer to as the “Catch-up Amount,” determined as the sum of 1.76% (7.06% annualized) prior to the end of the Waiver Period, or 1.82% (7.27% annualized) following the Waiver Period, multiplied by the Company’s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters that is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income.
•The Adviser will be paid 15% prior to the end of the Waiver Period, or 17.5% following the Waiver Period, of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters that exceeds the Catch-up Amount.
The amount of the income based incentive fee that will be paid to the Adviser for a particular quarter will equal the excess of (a) the income based incentive fee so calculated over (b) the aggregate income based incentive fee that was paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters subject to the Incentive Fee Cap as described below.
The income based incentive fee that will be paid to the Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 15% prior to the end of the Waiver Period, or 17.5% following the Waiver Period, of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate income based incentive fee that was paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.
“Cumulative Net Return” means (x) the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss (as defined below), if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company will pay no income based incentive fee to the Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the income based incentive fee that is payable to the Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company will pay an income based incentive fee to the Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the income based incentive fee that is payable to the Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company will pay an income based incentive fee to the Adviser equal to the incentive fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.
“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.
These calculations are prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a calendar quarter in which we incur an overall loss taking into account capital account losses. For example, if we receive Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in excess of the quarterly hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that calendar quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. If the Waiver Period ends on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the incentive fee applicable after the Waiver Period will be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable during and after the Waiver Period based on the number of days in such calendar quarter during and after the Waiver Period. In no event will the amendments to the income based incentive fee to include the three year income and total return lookback features allow the Adviser to receive greater cumulative income based incentive fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement than it would

have under the prior investment advisory agreement. Amounts waived by the Adviser are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income:
Incentive Fee Based on Income Prior to the end of the Waiver Period(1)

(expressed as an annualized rate(2) of return on the value of net assets as of the beginning of each of the quarters included in the Trailing Twelve Quarters)

(2)The income based incentive fee is determined on a quarterly basis but has been annualized for purposes of the above diagram. The diagram also does not reflect the Incentive Fee Cap.

(ii) Capital Gains based incentive fees
Since the completion of the IPO, the second part of the incentive fee, a capital gains incentive fee, has been determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to 17.5% of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Prior to the IPO, the second part of the incentive fee, a capital gains incentive fee, was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year in an amount equal to 15.0% of realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, similar to the voluntary waivers referenced above, the Adviser voluntarily waived its right to receive a capital gains based incentive fee above 15% from the date of consummation of the IPO through the Waiver Period. The Company will accrue, but will not pay, a capital gains incentive fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. Amounts waived by the Adviser are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.
The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period are appropriately prorated.
Administration Agreement
Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator provides, or oversees the performance of, administrative and compliance services, including, but not limited to, maintaining financial records, overseeing the calculation of NAV, compliance monitoring (including diligence and oversight of our other service providers), preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC, preparing materials and coordinating meetings of our Board, managing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others and providing office space, equipment and office services. We will reimburse the Administrator for its costs, expenses and allocable portion of overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) in connection with the services performed for us pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we will reimburse the Administrator for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. The Administrator has hired a sub-administrator to assist in the provision of administrative services. The sub-administrator receives compensation for its provision of sub-administrative services under a sub-administration agreement.
Certain Terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement
Each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement has been approved by the Board. Unless earlier terminated as described below, each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date it first became effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the independent trustees. We may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement or the Administration Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon 60 days’ written notice. The decision to terminate either agreement may be made by a majority of the Board or the shareholders holding a majority outstanding voting securities, which means the lesser of (1) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. In addition, the Adviser may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement or the Administrator may terminate the Administration Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon 60 days’ written notice. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations in the event of its assignment.
The Adviser and the Administrator shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for any act or omission or any loss suffered by the Company in connection with the matters to which the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, respectively, relate, provided that the Adviser and Administrator shall not be protected against any liability to the Company or its shareholders to which the Adviser or Administrator would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations (“disabling conduct”). Each of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement provides that, absent disabling conduct, each of our Adviser and our Administrator, as applicable, 
Table of Contents

and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administrator’s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as adviser or administrator for us. The Adviser and the Administrator shall not be liable under their respective agreements with us or otherwise for any loss due to the mistake, action, inaction, negligence, dishonesty, fraud or bad faith of any broker or other agent; provided, that such broker or other agent shall have been selected, engaged or retained and monitored by the Adviser or the Administrator in good faith, unless such action or inaction was made by reason of disabling conduct, or in the case of a criminal action or proceeding, where the Adviser or Administrator had reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful.
Distributions
We generally intend to distribute substantially all of our available earnings annually by paying distributions on a quarterly basis, as determined by the Board in its discretion. We cannot assure investors that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our distributions will generally be paid from current and/or accumulated tax earnings and profits, which includes interest income and capital gains generated by our investment portfolio, and any other income, including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees, that we receive from portfolio companies, if any. However, if we do not have sufficient current and/or accumulated tax earnings and profits to support our distributions, all or a part of such a distribution may be characterized as a return of capital for U.S. tax purposes. The specific tax characteristics of our dividends and other distributions are reported to shareholders after the end of each calendar year. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Distributions and Dividend Reinvestment.”
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”), pursuant to which we reinvest all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their dividends in cash, as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Distributions and Dividend Reinvestment.”
The number of shares to be issued to a shareholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a shareholder by the market price per common share at the close of regular trading on the NYSE on the payment date of a distribution, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. However, if the market price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share, the Company will issue shares at the greater of (i) the most recently computed NAV per share and (ii) 95% of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeded the most recently computed NAV per share). For example, if the most recently computed NAV per share is $25.00 and the market price on the payment date of a cash dividend is $24.00 per share, the Company will issue shares at $24.00 per share. If the most recently computed NAV per share is $25.00 and the market price on the payment date of a cash dividend is $27.00 per share, the Company will issue shares at $25.65 per share (95% of the current market price). If the most recently computed NAV per share is $25.00 and the market price on the payment date of a cash dividend is $26.00 per share, the Company will issue shares at $25.00 per share.
We use newly issued shares to implement the plan. Shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments.
No action is required on the part of a registered shareholder to have his, her or its cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in our shares. Shareholders can elect to “opt out” of the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan in their Subscription Agreements. A shareholder may elect to receive its entire dividend in cash at any time by notifying the Company’s transfer agent in writing. If, however, a shareholder requests to change its election within 95 days prior to a distribution, the request will be effective only with respect to distributions after the 95-day period.
There are no brokerage charges or other charges to shareholders who participate in the plan.
The Board may amend or supplement the terms of the dividend reinvestment plan at any time without shareholder approval. The plan may be terminated by the Company at any time upon notice in writing mailed to each shareholder of record.

Share Repurchase Plan
In October 2021, our Board approved a share repurchase plan (the "Company 10b5-1 Plan"), to acquire up to approximately $262 million (representing the net proceeds from the IPO) in the aggregate of our common shares at prices below our NAV per share over a specified period, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The Company 10b5-1 Plan terminated by its own terms in November 2022.  In February 2023, our Board authorized a share repurchase plan, under which we may repurchase up to $250 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common shares in the open market at prices below our NAV per share for a one-year term, in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act (the “Company 10b-18 Plan”). The timing, manner, price and amount of any share repurchases will be determined by us, in our sole discretion, based upon the evaluation of economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal and regulatory requirements and other factors. The Company 10b-18 Plan does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares of common shares or any shares of common shares at all. Consequently, we cannot assure shareholders that any specific number of shares of common shares, if any, will be repurchased under the Company 10b-18 Plan. The Company 10b-18 Plan may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. 
Competition
We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, mezzanine funds, performing and other credit funds, and funds that invest in CLOs, structured notes, derivatives and other types of collateralized securities and structured products), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. These other BDCs and investment funds might be reasonable investment alternatives to us and may be less costly or complex with fewer and/or different risks than we have. Moreover, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, have begun to invest in areas in which they have not traditionally invested, including making investments in middle market private U.S. companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities in middle market private U.S. companies may intensify. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we have. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to do. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors’ pricing, terms or structure. If we are forced to match our competitors’ pricing, terms or structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. A significant part of our competitive advantage stems from the fact that the market for investments in middle market private U.S. companies is underserved by traditional commercial banks and other financial sources. A significant increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors in this target market could force us to accept less attractive investment terms. Furthermore, many of our competitors have greater experience operating under, or are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC.
For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Risks Related To Our Business And Structure.”
Human Resource Capital
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of the Adviser or its affiliates pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administrator or its affiliates pursuant to the Administration Agreement. Each of our executive officers described herein is employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Adviser. The services necessary for the sourcing and administration of our investment portfolio will be provided by investment professionals employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. The Investment Team will focus on origination, non-originated investments and transaction development and the ongoing monitoring of our investments.
Regulation as a Business Development Company
The following discussion is a general summary of the material prohibitions and descriptions governing BDCs generally. It does not purport to be a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs.
Qualifying Assets. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “Qualifying Assets,” unless, at the time the acquisition is made, Qualifying Assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of Qualifying Assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
Table of Contents

(1)Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an Eligible Portfolio Company (as defined below), or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an Eligible Portfolio Company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An “Eligible Portfolio Company” is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
(a)is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b)is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
(c)satisfies any of the following:
(i)does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
(ii)has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
(iii)is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the Eligible Portfolio Company; or
(iv)is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million.
(2)Securities of any Eligible Portfolio Company controlled by the BDC.
(3)Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
(4)Securities of an Eligible Portfolio Company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and the BDC already owns 60% of the outstanding equity of the Eligible Portfolio Company.
(5)Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
(6)Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Significant Managerial Assistance. A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as Qualifying Assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its trustees, officers or employees, offers to provide and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company’s officers or other organizational or financial guidance.
Temporary Investments. Pending investment in other types of Qualifying Assets, as described above, our investments can consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which are referred to herein, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets would be Qualifying Assets.
Warrants. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the issuance, terms and amount of warrants, options or rights to purchase shares that it may have outstanding at any time. In particular, the amount of shares that would result from 
Table of Contents

the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase shares cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares.
Leverage and Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio. We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at or above 150% immediately after each such issuance. On September 25, 2018, our sole shareholder approved the adoption of this 150% threshold pursuant to Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and such election became effective the following day. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we are required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. We are also permitted to borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities.
We have established asset based credit facilities and may establish future facilities or enter into other financing arrangements to facilitate investments and the timely payment of our expenses. Our existing financing facilities bear, and it is anticipated that any future credit facilities will bear interest at floating rates at to be determined spreads over LIBOR. Shareholders indirectly bear the costs associated with any borrowings under a credit facility or otherwise, including increased management fees payable to the Adviser as a result of such borrowings. Our current credit facilities require us, and future lenders may require us to pledge assets, commitments and/or drawdowns (and the ability to enforce the payment thereof) and to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. In addition, from time to time, our losses on leveraged investments may result in the liquidation of other investments held by us and may result in additional drawdowns to repay such amounts.
We also issued unsecured bonds and may have additional bond offerings in the future. 
We may enter into a total return swap (“TRS”) agreement. A TRS is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the TRS, which may include a specified security, basket of securities or securities indices during a specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate. A TRS effectively adds leverage to a portfolio by providing investment exposure to a security or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or investing directly in such market. Because of the unique structure of a TRS, a TRS often offers lower financing costs than are offered through more traditional borrowing arrangements. The Company would typically have to post collateral to cover this potential obligation. To the extent the Company complies with the applicable requirements of Rule 18f-4, the leverage incurred through TRS will not be considered a borrowing for purposes of the Company’s overall leverage limitation.
We have also created leverage by securitizing our assets (including in CLOs) and retaining the equity portion of the securitized vehicle and may enter into other debt securitizations in the future. Debt securitizations (including in CLOs) are a form of secured financing, which would generally be consolidated on our financial statements and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a CLO debt securitization on favorable terms or at all or that any such financing will benefit our investment performance. We may also from time to time make secured loans of our marginable securities to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions.
Code of Ethics. We and the Adviser have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code are permitted to invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. You may obtain copies of the codes of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
Affiliated Transactions. We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from conducting certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our trustees who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits us, among other things, to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliates of the Adviser and certain funds managed and controlled by the Adviser and its affiliates, subject to certain terms and conditions.
Other. We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act, and be subject to the periodic reporting and related requirements of the 1934 Act.
We are also required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any trustee or officer against any 
Table of Contents

liability to our shareholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
We are also required to designate a chief compliance officer and to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation.
We are not permitted to change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of such company’s shares present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by the Adviser, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, the Adviser has a duty to monitor corporate events and to vote proxies, as well as a duty to cast votes in the best interest of clients and not subrogate client interests to its own interests. Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act places specific requirements on registered investment advisers with proxy voting authority.
Proxy Policies
The Adviser’s policies and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that the Adviser votes proxies in the best interest of the Company and addresses how it will resolve any conflict of interest that may arise when voting proxies and, in so doing, to maximize the value of the investments made by the Company, taking into consideration the Company’s investment horizons and other relevant factors. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although the Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
Decisions on how to vote a proxy generally are made by the Adviser. The Investment Committee and the members of the Investment Team covering the applicable security often have the most intimate knowledge of both a company’s operations and the potential impact of a proxy vote’s outcome. Decisions are based on a number of factors which may vary depending on a proxy’s subject matter, but are guided by the general policies described in the proxy policy. In addition, the Adviser may determine not to vote a proxy after consideration of the vote’s expected benefit to clients and the cost of voting the proxy. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, the Adviser will require the members of the Investment Committee to disclose any personal conflicts of interest they may have with respect to overseeing a Company’s investment in a particular company.
Proxy Voting Records
You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, Blackstone Credit BDC Advisors LLC, 345 Park Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, NY 10154.
Reporting Obligations and Available Information
We furnish our shareholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the 1934 Act.
We file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, and our directors, officers and 10% beneficial owners file reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 pursuant to section 13(a), 15(d) or 16(a) of the 1934 Act. The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information. We have made available free of charge on our website (www.bxsl.com) our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our governing documents.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following discussion is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to the Company. This discussion does not purport to be complete or to deal with all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to the Company. This discussion is based upon present provisions of the Code, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative ruling authorities, all of which are subject to change, or differing interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors with regard to the U.S. federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of our shares, as well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, foreign country or other taxing jurisdiction.
The Company has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify each taxable year, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
To qualify for the favorable tax treatment accorded to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code, the Company must, among other things: (1) have an election in effect to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; (2) have filed with its return for the taxable year an election to be a RIC or have made such election for a previous taxable year; (3) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from (a) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including but not limited to gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or currencies; and (b) net income derived from an interest in certain publicly traded partnerships that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that derive less than 90% of their gross income from the items described in (a) above (each, a “Qualified Publicly Traded Partnership”); and (4) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year of the Company (a) at least 50% of the value of the Company’s total assets is represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities and securities of other RICs, and other securities for purposes of this calculation limited, in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater in value than 5% of the value of the Company’s total assets and to not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of the Company’s total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of (I) any one issuer, (II) any two or more issuers which the Company controls and which are determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses or (III) any one or more Qualified Publicly Traded Partnerships (described in 3b above).
As a RIC, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that term is defined in the Code, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes in each taxable year to its shareholders, provided that it distributes at least 90% of the sum of its investment company taxable income and its net tax-exempt income for such taxable year. The Company intends to distribute to its shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain.
Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax. To prevent imposition of the excise tax, the Company must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 of the calendar year, and (iii) any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years. For these purposes, the Company will be deemed to have distributed any income or gains on which it paid U.S. federal income tax.
A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of any calendar year if it is declared by the Company in October, November or December with a record date in such a month and paid by the Company during January of the following calendar year. Such distributions will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.
If the Company fails to qualify as a RIC or fails to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on its taxable income (including distributions of net capital gain), even if such income were distributed to its shareholders, and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxed to shareholders as ordinary dividend income. Such distributions generally would be eligible (i) to be treated as “qualified dividend income” in the case of individual and other non-corporate shareholders and (ii) for the dividends received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders. In addition, the Company could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay taxes and make distributions (which could be subject to interest charges) before requalifying for taxation as a RIC.
