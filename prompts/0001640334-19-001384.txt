As of that date, we had 991,770,362 issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001.

The acquired entities are owned by the Company’s management; therefore, the transaction has been accounted for as a business combination under common control in accordance to ASC-805-30-5, in which the assets and liabilities of HK and WOFE have been presented at their carrying values at the date of the transaction. 

During the year ended March 31, 2018, we disposed the discontinued business, Element Resources International Limited. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the disposal.

The Company has no present plans to be acquired or to merge with another company, nor does the Company, nor any of its shareholders, have plans to enter into a change of control or similar transaction.

Current Business

The Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Wyoming as Ace Lock & Security, Inc. The Company was established as an exploration stage company engaged in the search for commercially viable minerals. We no longer pursue opportunities related to the exploration of minerals. Our name changed to Yinfu Gold Corporation, as filed with the State of Wyoming on November 18, 2010, signified that we have commenced working toward a major change in our business plan and business model.

Effective November 20, 2014, the Company executed a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) to acquire 100% of the shares and assets of China Enterprise Overseas Investment & Finance Group Limited (“CEI”). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company has agreed to issue 800 million restricted common shares of the Company to the owners of CEI. In connection with the acquisition, the Company acquired the domain http://www.dahuacheng.com with a customer database consisting of 31 million members as of November 17, 2014.

Pursuant to the Agreement, on or before January 1, 2015, CEI was to deliver to the Company, duly authorized, properly and fully executed documents in English, evidencing and confirming the sale of 100% of the shares of CEI and its assets, specifically detailing the assets and an asset valuation prepared by an independent professionally qualified valuator. The valuation report was received by the Company on January 28, 2015.

Additionally, the Agreement stated that both parties agreed that all the shares, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement, shall be issued as soon as practicable following the signing of the agreement, but all the shares so issued were to be held in escrow until all terms and conditions are fulfilled.

As of the date of this filing, the various terms and conditions of the Agreement have been fulfilled on January 28, 2015, therefore, the share certificates representing the shares have been issued in the names of the CEI shareholders and the Agreement between the Company and CEI was closed on January 28, 2015.

Currently, we do not yet have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. Historically, we were able to raise a limited amount of capital through a private placement of our equity stock and through loans from our president, but we are uncertain about our continued ability to obtain adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail.

Our president and directors continue to provide their labor at no charge. When we are able to do so, we plan to hire up to 20 staff members during the next 12 months of operation, and will also rely on the services of independent professionals for the auditing, evaluation and legal requirements for our listing business.

Markets

We are working to establish and build a P2P online lending service platform and become one of the P2P on-line lending service providers in China.

Competition

Barrier to entry in the industry is low and there are many competitors. Our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. There are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful. 
Seasonality 

The nature of our products and services does not appear to be affected by seasonal variations.

Government Regulations

Other than the required adherence to general business laws and regulatory disclosure, our services do not appear to be affected by any specific additional regulations. However, this does not preclude the possibility that governments where we operate or may eventually operate will not institute regulations that will make our company difficult or impossible to operate.
Intellectual Property

We currently hold rights to a registered database with 31 million members, and we have not filed for copyright or trademark protection for our name or services.

Research and Development

We have spent no time on specialized research and development activities, and have no plans to undertake any research or development in the future.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are not subject to environmental laws, including any laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes and we do not anticipate capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.
Employees

We currently have eight employees, including our president and directors who serve without remuneration. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with local prevailing wage regulations. None of our employees is represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and our relationship with our employees is good.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
