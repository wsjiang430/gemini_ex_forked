ITEM 1.        BUSINESSHistory and Organization
     Gold Resource Corporation was organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on August 24, 1998. We are a producer of metal concentrates that contain gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, and doré containing gold and silver from the Aguila and Alta Gracia projects in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico (“Oaxaca Mining Unit”). The Aguila project includes the Arista underground mine and processing facility, which commenced operation in 2010. The Alta Gracia project includes the Mirador underground mine which began operations in 2017.  
     On August 12, 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Walker Lane Minerals Corporation.  The assets included in that acquisition included the Isabella Pearl project, including significant permitting for an open-pit heap leach operation in the Walker-Lane mineral belt in Nevada.  Since the acquisition, we have continued development on the project and in May 2018, we received the final regulatory approvals to construct and operate a mine. We commenced construction of the mine shortly thereafter and expect to commence production in mid-2019.  We also continue exploration and evaluation work on our portfolio of other precious metal properties in Nevada, United States of America (“Nevada Mining Unit”) and continue to evaluate other properties for possible acquisition.
     The Aguila processing facility produces metal concentrates and doré from ore mined from both the Arista and Mirador Mines. All of our production and revenue currently comes from our Oaxaca Mining Unit.  The Aguila and Alta Gracia projects, include a total of approximately 30,439 hectares of mining concessions, access roads from a major highway, haul roads, a processing facility, and adjoining buildings, an assay lab, an open pit and underground mines, tailings facilities and other infrastructure. Please see Item 2. Properties for maps and additional information.
     We commenced mining and milling operations from the Aguila project in July 2010, initially from the Aguila open pit mine, followed by development and mining the Arista underground mine.  The Arista Mine was expanded in 2016 with the development of the Switchback vein system.  The Arista underground mine is located approximately two kilometers from the processing facility.  Most of the production from our Oaxaca Mining Unit from 2011 to present has been from the Arista Mine.  In 2017, development of the Mirador Mine advanced to a point which allowed for consistent ore feed to the Aguila processing facility.
     Our operations in Oaxaca are conducted through our Mexican subsidiary, Don David Gold Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“DDGM”). Our Nevada exploration, development and construction work is performed through two wholly-owned subsidiaries, GRC Nevada Inc. and Walker Lane Minerals Corp. (“Walker Lane”).
     In this report, “Company,” “our,” “us” and “we” refer to Gold Resource Corporation together with our subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.  See glossary on page 30 for additional definitions

    2018 Developments
     For the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported revenue of $115.3 million, mine gross profit of $33.7 million and net income of $9.3 million. Substantially all of our 2018 revenue was from the Arista Mine in Mexico.  We achieved our annual production outlook of 27,000 gold ounces and 1,700,000 silver ounces plus or minus a range of 10%. Our annual 2018 mill production totaled 26,838 gold ounces, 1,672,034 silver ounces, 1,652 copper tonnes, 7,280 lead tonnes and 19,808 zinc tonnes.

 Oaxaca Mining Unit 
     During 2018, we continued to develop the Arista underground mine, including the Switchback vein system.  In 2018, we began some bulk tonnage mining techniques at Switchback, while also processing a large amount of development ore.  We began construction of three critical capital projects in 2018.  These projects are the paste fill plant, the tailings lift, and the power grid project.  The paste fill plant is targeted to improve the Arista Mine’s safety, allow for more efficient extraction of stope pillars when possible, and provide for cemented tailings storage underground which will reduce the amount of surface tailings deposition.  The third phase of the surface tailings impoundment lift was near completion at the end of 2018.  The power grid project began construction in 2018 and will provide lower cost grid power to the Aguila project.  
     In addition to the Arista underground mine, we continued to develop the Mirador Mine in 2018 and consistently delivered development ore to the Aguila processing facility.  While difficult ground conditions slowed development at times, we continued to target higher grade areas in the mine.  We have built, commissioned and continued to develop and operate the Mirador Mine with internally generated cash flow.
     Nevada Mining Unit
     During 2018, we obtained all the necessary permits to commence development and construction on our Isabella Pearl project.  We completed the construction of and liner placement on the heap leach pad as well as the pregnant and barren solution ponds.  We installed and commissioned the crushing facility, the laboratory, and office buildings.  We began mining, crushing, and placing ore on the pad during the fourth quarter of the year.  Construction of the ADR plant is ongoing as is other infrastructure including water tanks and water and electrical service.  We continue to target gold sales in mid-2019.Dividends 
     Since July 2010, we have paid a monthly dividend. During 2018, we paid one-sixth cent per share per month, which totaled $0.02 per share for the year. Please see Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities for additional information.     Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance
     Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to property loss, environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, below for additional information.Environmental Matters 
     We conduct our operations so as to protect the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Our operating mines have reclamation plans in place that we believe meet all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2018, $3.3 million was accrued on our consolidated balance sheet for reclamation costs relating to operating and development properties.

Competitive Business Conditions
     The acquisition of gold and silver properties is subject to intense competition. Identifying and evaluating potential mining prospects is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. Due to our limited capital and personnel, we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many other companies with regard to exploration and, if warranted, advancement of mining properties. We believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense in the future.Government Regulations and Permits 
     In connection with mining, milling and exploration activities, we are subject to United States and Mexican federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. The department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”).  The departments responsible for the environmental regulation in the United States of America include the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP), Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and the Nevada Department of Wildlife (“NDOW”).  Any of these regulators have broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with its environmental regulations or standards. Potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies, including ours, include but are not limited to, acid rock drainage, cyanide containment and handling, contamination of water sources, dust, and noise.
     For operations at our Oaxaca Mining Unit, we have secured and continue to secure various regulatory permits from federal, state and local agencies. These governmental and regulatory permits generally govern the processes being used to operate, the stipulations concerning air quality and water issues, and the plans and obligations for reclamation of the properties at the conclusion of operations. We have received the required local community support for the Aguila and Alta Gracia projects in the area where we are currently producing. 
     We have obtained the permits necessary to develop, construct, and operate our Isabella Pearl project.  Please see Item 2. Properties – Nevada Mining Unit, for more information on the status of our development efforts.  In connection with these permits and exploration activities in Nevada, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment, including, but not limited to, the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. 
    
Customers
     During the year ended December 31, 2018, one customer accounted for 94% of our revenue in our Oaxaca Mining Unit.  In the event that our relationship with the customer is interrupted for any reason, we believe that we would be able to locate another entity to purchase our products. However, any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and adversely affect our operating results. We periodically review our options for alternative sales outlets to mitigate the concentration of risk in case of any unforeseen disruptions.Employees and Contractors
     We have approximately forty-seven full-time employees, six of which serve as our executive officers. These individuals devote all of their business time to our affairs.
