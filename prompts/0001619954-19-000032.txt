On September 17, 2014, Inovalon, Inc. implemented a holding company reorganization, pursuant to which Inovalon Holdings, Inc. became the new parent company of Inovalon, Inc. and Inovalon, Inc. became the direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware on September 11, 2014. Inovalon, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 18, 2005. In this Annual Report, unless we indicate otherwise or the context requires, references to the “Company,” “Inovalon,” “we,” “our,” “ours,” and “us” refer to Inovalon Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Industry Overview and Demand Drivers
The Company believes that healthcare is increasingly becoming data-driven in nature, transactional in design, real-time in speed, and ultimately consumer-centric in focus. Driven by the first waves of disease-burden based reimbursement models and quality incentive programs, data has gained an increasing role in the U.S. healthcare system. Data is increasingly a competitive differentiator, as its aggregation, analysis, validation, and associated connectivity can be leveraged to identify individual patients’ unique needs, refine care plans, speed drug discovery and commercialization, reduce waste, expand the value proposition of medications and medical devices, and streamline healthcare workflows and supply chains. As transparency into the many facets of healthcare increases, the Company believes the pace of the industry’s transformation will continue to accelerate, ultimately placing consumers at the center as they play an increasingly active role in their care.
We believe that demand for our offerings is driven by the confluence of a number of fundamental healthcare industry trends, including:
Shift to Value-Based Healthcare.    The healthcare industry is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a shift from volume-based models to value-based and outcome-based models. The traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model in healthcare has played a major role in elevating both the level and growth rate of healthcare spending. In response, both the public and private sectors are shifting away from the historical fee-for-service (volume-based) models toward value-based, capitated payment models that are designed to incentivize value and quality at an individual patient level. The number of Americans covered by capitated payment programs (care programs wherein an organization is financially responsible for the healthcare of a population of patients for which the total compensation is fixed other than adjustments for factors including specifically how sick individual patients are, how much resource is needed to be applied or spent on each patient, what is the quality of the clinical care, and other demographic factors) continues to increase, according to industry sources and our internal estimates. This increase is expected to further drive the critical importance to accurately measure, analyze, report, and improve patient disease and comorbidity conditions, utilization rates, and clinical quality outcomes. Further, this shift from volume-based to value-based and outcome-based models is increasingly impacting other segments of the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, medical device 
1

manufacturers, and diagnostics companies. For example, pharmaceutical companies are increasingly pursuing outcomes-based contracting (“OBC”) arrangements with health plans in order to leverage data and analytics to demonstrate value and improve care outcomes. This is particularly true as a large number of new, complex, and expensive specialty treatments are expected to enter the market over the coming years.
Digitization of Healthcare Information.    Across the healthcare landscape, a significant amount of data is being created every day, driven by patient care, payment systems, regulatory compliance, and record keeping. These data include information within patient health records, clinical trials, pharmacy benefit programs, imaging systems, sensors and monitoring platforms, laboratory results, patient reported information, hospital and physician performance programs, and billing and payment processing. However, despite significant investments by public and private sources within the industry, the digitized healthcare data remain largely stored in “walled gardens”—data that is static and not easily shared or interpreted. As the amount of data in healthcare continues to grow, we believe that it will be critical for participants across the healthcare industry to be able to analyze this disparate data and apply insights in a targeted manner in order to better achieve the goals of higher quality and more efficient care.
Healthcare Becoming Increasingly Consumer-centric. Increasingly, the patient (the consumer of healthcare) wants to take a more active and informed role in how their own individual healthcare is delivered—how to select their health plan and based on what information, how to select and interact with a physician, how to determine whether or not to have a particular surgical procedure or whether or not to take a particular medication, etc. Similar to other industries including financial services, retail, and entertainment, the healthcare marketplace is becoming increasingly consumer-centric. This transformation means that interactions in healthcare are becoming increasingly data-driven, transactional, and real-time in nature, all of which require increasingly sophisticated data ingestion and analytical capabilities, extensive industry connectivity, and high-speed, scalable, and secure compute infrastructures.
Increasing Complexity.    The healthcare industry is on a course of dramatically progressive complexity. As technology employed in the healthcare space has become increasingly sophisticated, new diagnostics and treatments have been introduced, the pool of clinical research has expanded, and the paradigms dictating payment and regulatory oversight have multiplied. This expanding complexity drives a growing and continuous need for the aggregation, analysis, and targeted application of the underlying and resulting data.
Unsustainable Rise in Healthcare Costs. According to the 2017 National Health Expenditure Projections prepared by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), healthcare spending in the U.S. is projected to have increased 4.6% on a year-over-year basis to $3.5 trillion in 2017, representing 17.9% of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”). CMS projects healthcare spending in the U.S. to increase to approximately 20% of GDP by 2026. To address this expected significant rise in healthcare costs, the U.S. healthcare market is seeking more efficient and effective methods of delivering care. This same trend is playing out across modernized nations around the globe.

Our Market Opportunity
We believe that our market opportunity for data-driven healthcare solutions is significant and growing. The ability to aggregate, integrate, and analyze data on a massive scale and apply garnered insights in a manner that achieves meaningful impact is crucial for healthcare payers (e.g., health plans and integrated health delivery systems), healthcare providers (e.g., hospitals, accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), post-acute care providers, and physicians), pharmaceutical companies (e.g., medication discovery and manufacturers, specialty pharmacies, retail pharmacies, pharmacy benefit management companies), medical device manufacturers, diagnostics companies, and consumers. 
According to third-party industry estimates, the addressable market for software and related services capabilities serving these healthcare constituents continues to expand from an estimated $84 billion in 2014 to approximately $142 billion in 2018. According to industry sources, the market for software and related services is approximately $17.3 billion within the U.S. payer market. We believe that as analytics continue to demonstrate greater value within the U.S. payer landscape, the market will expand commensurately. We believe that the market opportunity for our current offerings within the payer market, the historical focus of our Company, is approximately $16.3 billion. As we continue to build and launch new capabilities and expand our market opportunities following the acquisition of ABILITY, we believe analytics will provide a significantly larger value opportunity within this same payer space. For providers, industry sources estimate that software and related services represent a $40.1 billion U.S. market size. We believe that the market opportunity for our current offerings within the provider market is approximately $6.8 billion (excluding expected expansion of market opportunity following the ABILITY acquisition). In the pharmaceutical and life-sciences market, industry sources estimate a $51.4 billion market size for total software and related services spend. We believe that the market opportunity for our current offerings within the pharmaceutical and life-sciences market is approximately $7.0 billion, largely driven by our acquisitions of Avalere Health, Inc. (“Avalere”), a leading provider of data-driven advisory services and business intelligence solutions in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry, in 2015, and Creehan Holding Co., Inc. (“Creehan”), a leader in specialty pharmacy software platforms, in 2016. In the consumer market, industry sources estimate a $33.2 billion global market size for mobile health applications and solutions. We believe that, over time, analytics will also drive a significant opportunity expansion in the consumer market, as consumers seek to take a more active and informed role in how their healthcare is delivered.

Platform Capabilities
Data Integration.    Throughout the healthcare industry, data is captured from many different sources, and while standards for exchanging information between healthcare applications are emerging, much of the data associated with population health remains in disparate silos, without the exchange of data, insight into patient or program status, or coordination of relevant patient engagements, and is both interchanged and processed without automation. Where investments have been made in the digitization of health data, many of the resulting solutions remain “walled gardens” of information—data that is static and not easily shared or interpreted.
Our data integration platform capability was designed and developed to address these challenges. This capability enables integration of any data source, on any hardware platform, in any data format at extremely high speeds. Our data integration platform receives information from external sources through a number of channels, including secure FTP, web services, and direct connections to external systems. Our data integration platform loads data into our “data lake” in its native format, which ensures that we maintain all data as it is received and allows users to query the data directly in its structured or unstructured format. Processing data in its raw format, however, presents many technological challenges. We have developed interactive data mapping technologies to support the mapping of the raw data files to staging structures used by our platform to convert data from its native format into a structured format that can be used by all processes on our platform. Once mapped, the data is run through multiple processes to standardize the data and perform data verification and integrity checks so that values are uniform across our entire platform.
We believe that our enterprise-scale data integration and management capability enables us to receive, integrate, and process extremely large-scale data flows at industry-leading speeds, and is a critical capability in achieving material improvement in clinical quality outcomes and financial performance in healthcare, creating a material market differentiator and value creator for us and our clients. We integrate data seamlessly and securely into our systems through our proprietary Extract, Transform, Load tools and processes. This system manages the process of defining and configuring thousands of industry data feeds from our clients and partners (such as electronic health records (“EHR”), laboratory, pharmacy, patient reported, claims, paper based medical records, biometric, and hospital data feeds respectively), manages the data processing workflow, and monitors the ongoing provision and quality of data through the application of more than 2,000 data integrity checks.
Our big data technology has been created through the use of internally developed software coupled with industry-leading technology frameworks that are vendor-agnostic. We leverage modern big data frameworks such as Hadoop and the Hadoop Distributed File System, which enable us to store structured and unstructured data while making it readily accessible by our analytics engine. Our big data processing capabilities enable dramatic improvements in data integration and analytical cycle speed to value recognition to empower improvements for intelligent product development through the “real world” functional application. Our big data technology lays the foundation of the data fabric allowing integration into our analytical capabilities. 
Advanced Analytics.    We have developed, honed, and scaled a broad portfolio of sophisticated analytics. Applying our subject matter expertise in computer processing, data architecture, statistics, medical sciences, healthcare policy, and leveraging the billions of medical events within our significant propriety datasets, we believe that we have developed one of the most advanced analytical platforms in the industry, as well as a culture and set of analytical toolsets that serve to rapidly innovate and expand our platform capabilities. In addition, by leveraging technologies such as Optical Character Recognition, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, we are able to further enhance our analytical capabilities, improve efficiency, and accelerate processing capacity and client value delivery.
Intervention Systems.    In order to translate analytical insights into tangible impact, interventions at the point of care are critical. We are able to translate our analytical insights into meaningful impact through data-driven, multi-channel intervention platforms, which include toolsets and services that enable our clients to take the insights derived from our analytics and implement solutions that achieve meaningful impact at the patient and provider level. Our intervention capabilities include direct connectivity with many leading EHR systems, hard copy and electronic mail, and interactions via telephone, in patients’ homes, through mobile devices, at dedicated patient centers, through web-enabled decision support tools, in retail pharmacies, and in traditional clinical locations.
Business Processing.    Our business processing capability consists of a powerful business intelligence system and comprehensive data warehousing to provide historical and current data insight, reporting, and benchmarking to support multiple client business needs such as government-mandated data filings, financial planning, and compliance requirements. We have also implemented an integrated platform of data visualization, allowing clients and their downstream users and operators to access data and analytical results from the population-level down to sophisticated individual drill-down details in real-time.
Data Sets
Datasets and the management of data are part of our core strengths, which provide meaningful insight into how a patient, provider, or population is doing. Our datasets grant us both relative and absolute insight, and inform the construction of new 
5

analytics capabilities, predictive models, and impact predictions. Further, data management speeds our time to client impact, decreases the burden on clients choosing to do business with us, and empowers our achievement of mission and results.
In addition to being maintained and tagged within client-specific data lakes, data we receive in the course of providing our services are statistically de-identified and stored in our MORE2 Registry®. The MORE2 Registry® goes beyond just claims data to include information about demographics, enrollment, diagnoses, procedures, pharmacy, laboratory results, and deep medical record clinical data and presents a significant representative mix of commercial, HIX Marketplace, Medicare Advantage, and managed Medicaid care plan patients. As of December 31, 2018, our MORE2 Registry® dataset contained data pertaining to more than 964,000 physicians, 519,000 clinical facilities, 264 million Americans, and 42 billion medical events. The following is a sample of components within our MORE2 Registry®:

• Patient Demographic Data | • Benefits Data 
• Medical Record Documentation | • Encounter and Procedural Data 
• Operating Room, Procedure, | • Pharmacy Data 
Discharge Summary, | • Imaging Report Data 
Emergency Room Records | • Laboratory & Pathology Data 
• Electronic Health Record Data | • Durable Medical Equipment Data 
• Health Risk Assessment Data | • Self-Reported Data 
• Practitioner Profile Data | • Social History Data 
• Claim Diagnostic Data | • Activities of Daily Living (ADL)
• Eligibility and Enrollment Data | • Cost Data 

Connectivity
We have developed technology that enables real-time, highly differentiated data aggregation and point-of-care interoperability through many leading EHR systems, which drives positive impact and efficiency for clients, clinicians, patients, and the Company. 
The Inovalon ONE® Platform facilitates the two-way exchange of clinical data with both cloud and non-cloud based EHR and integrates the Healthcare Enterprise systems, connecting thousands of physicians in an effective, efficient, secure and scalable fashion while minimizing disruption. The Inovalon ONE® Platform automatically requests and retrieves necessary clinical data, which is then analyzed by our advanced predictive analytics to identify gaps in patient care, and then embeds those insights directly into the clinical workflow to inform targeted interventions at the point-of-care. 
Technology Infrastructure
We believe that our track record of service is the result of our commitment to excellence and our devotion to maintaining one of the industry’s most sophisticated technology infrastructures. We have made significant investments over the past decade to build an industry-leading enterprise-scale infrastructure capable of managing the heavy computing and storage requirements of our 
6

cloud-based data-driven business. Today, we employ a combination of owned, virtualized data centers along with hosted facilities to enable seamless, secure, and scalable solutions nationwide.
Our physical converged compute and storage infrastructure is deployed with a hybrid approach to cloud computing. Leveraging heavily virtualized infrastructure together with orchestration and automation tools, we have achieved significant capabilities within our private cloud environment. 
The following diagram provides a high level overview of our key infrastructure elements.
_______________________________________
Our data and compute capacity is maintained within an interconnected set of infrastructure sets made up of owned and co-located data centers. The three principal datacenters owned by Inovalon are located in the Washington D.C. metro area, Atlanta metro region and the Pittsburgh metro region. Our co-located datacenter facilities are located in Northern Virginia, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Phoenix, Arizona. Each datacenter supports the ability to interconnect agnostically to third-party cloud capacity providers. This macro architecture provides us a significant ability to maintain both enterprise-level capacity and redundancy, while also achieving significant flexibility and cost effectiveness for burst capacity needs.
We have a proven track record of implementing virtualization as our current datacenters are over 85% virtualized using VMware technologies. Operations of the virtualization technologies are streamlined by the orchestration, automation, and reporting capabilities provided by our private cloud and integration with public cloud service providers. These technologies are used to provide computing, storage, and networking components to the hosting environment and provide operational efficiencies and cost optimization for the corporation.
We have implemented a sophisticated hybrid cloud and service based application stack design, enabling “burst” capacity architecture to allow provider-agnostic utilization of public cloud capacity if such capacity is required. Our virtualization technology has been integrated with automation and orchestration technology to create a cloud environment that provides both Infrastructure and Platform as a Service capabilities. These service based capabilities allow us to dynamically expand our compute capacity in real time and provide the business with a cost effective and nimble platform. By leveraging both private and public cloud offerings, we can provide efficient, elastic, and cost effective compute resources based on the operational needs of our clients. We believe we are leaders in the use of big data technology and high performance compute technology stack at the point of care in our industry.
Our platform is built utilizing an innovative enterprise infrastructure platform enabling robust performance scaling, strong security, high availability, and advanced business continuity options. The building blocks of this infrastructure consist of the following:

• | Multiple data centers connected by redundant high-speed WAN connections;


• | High competency and utilization of virtualization technologies;

7


• | Rapid provisioning of computing capabilities to support the dynamic elasticity needed to support the variable computing needs of the application;


• | Measured service to optimize resource utilization and provide transparency of the utilized services; and


• | Available hosting facilities providing physical structure compliance with Federal Information Security Management Act (“FISMA”) standards.

Disaster Recovery.    Our contingency program is designed to provide response and subsequent recovery from unplanned business disruptions. Supported by our data centers, our contingency program provides a coordinated emergency response foundation across the organization. The program includes business continuity, emergency occupant, pandemic planning, security incident response, and disaster recovery plans that encompass all areas of our technology and business operations. These interrelated processes align to provide significant protection and risk mitigation. In addition to company-wide plans, specific details on event response and subsequent business recovery actions and activities are included within each respective business unit plan.
_______________________________________

Through significant investment in hardware, software, and application design, Inovalon provides solutions that support mission critical, business critical, and business important products and services through our nationwide enterprise data center presence.
Network Operations Center.    We maintain a central network operations center (“NOC”) where systems are monitored to ensure proper operation and capacity utilization. The NOC monitors and collects information about a multitude of technology operating metrics regarding system load and status. In conjunction with the rapid provisioning capability, automation, and standardization, the NOC provides us with the automated capabilities to oversee and manage our technology resources in order to meet business demands.
Privacy Management and Data Security.    Protected health information is a sensitive component of personal information. It is highly important that information about an individual’s healthcare is properly and thoroughly protected from any inappropriate access, use and disclosure. Given the industry vertical in which we operate, we realize the importance of the safety and sensitivity of personal health information. We have been a trusted partner to our clients and are committed to the security and privacy of our client data, enterprise data, and our systems through the application of highly trained personnel, robust processes, and technology. Our privacy and security management includes:

• | governance, frameworks, and models to promote good decision making and accountability. Our comprehensive privacy and security program is based on industry practices including those of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, Defense Information Systems Agency, and FISMA;


• | an internal security council, which advises on and prioritizes the development of information security initiatives, projects, and policies;

8


• | a layered approach to privacy and security management to avoid single points of failure;

• | ongoing evaluation of privacy and security practices to promote continuous improvement;


• | use of safeguards and controls including: administrative, technical, and physical safeguards;


• | collaboration with our clients on best security and privacy practices; and


• | working closely with leading researchers, thought leaders, and policy makers.

Platform Modularity
Our platform has been created through the use of internally-developed software coupled with industry-leading technology frameworks that are vendor-agnostic. Because we have designed and developed our own software, we have built significant flexibility and modularity into our platform components. This enables us to not only enhance our existing products as our clients’ needs evolve, but also to increase our addressable market opportunity by rapidly developing new product offerings and expanding into adjacent markets in the healthcare industry. Our acquisitions of ABILITY, Avalere, and Creehan further enhance this process through the infusion of our data and analytics into additional offerings, new products, greater differentiation, additional capabilities, technologies, client relationships, and industry expertise that they bring. Our large, deep proprietary data sets in the MORE2 Registry® also enable and support this flexibility and modularity, as the depth and breadth of the data allows its analysis and application in the context of many situations across the healthcare industry-not just for payers, but also providers, pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, diagnostics companies, etc. For example, within the set of Inovalon ONE® Platform Components that would typically enable our Quality Measurement and Reporting offering for a national health plan, a certain subset of these Components could be combined with an additional new set of Components to enable our OBC offering with a global pharmaceutical company.
Our Clients
For over 19 years, we have provided quality services to our clients. During that time, we have built a leading position and have become a true thought leader and innovator in our industry. We have achieved significant scale, and we believe that we play a key role in the U.S. healthcare market. 
Our clients renew existing client agreements throughout the year. The renewal rates of existing clients for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were approximately 90%, 88% and 93%, respectively. The renewal rate is representative of clients with engagements exceeding $0.1 million in revenue. 
Sales and Marketing
We believe that our sales and marketing initiatives are key to capitalizing on our significant market and growth opportunities. During 2018, we significantly increased the scale and sophistication of our sales force by leveraging the expertise of technology focused personnel supported by subject matter experts. While we have successfully leveraged our sales and marketing as we have grown, we believe that additional strategic investments in sales and marketing capacity and capabilities will enable us to increasingly seize on the healthcare industry’s need for advanced technological capabilities including data connectivity, advanced analytics, intervention toolsets, and integrated business processing to empower the healthcare industry’s transformation from volume-based models to value-based models.
We sell our offerings primarily through three avenues:

• | Business development led by product and management personnel: We benefit significantly from the subject matter expertise, market credibility, thought leadership, and relationships of our executives, senior management, and product leaders within the industry. They have played, and are expected to continue to play, a significant role in the establishment and ongoing development of our client relationships.

In addition, in order to enhance our value proposition, our sales and marketing staff develops best practices tools, case studies, and educational materials to drive deeper client engagement, understanding, and utilization.
Operations
Our operations are divided into two groups. Our IT Operations Group manages the process steps from data receipt through to the generation of analytical outputs. Our Services Operations Group manages the process steps applied to achieve impact through our data-driven intervention platforms.
IT Operations Group
We achieve excellence in the operation of our technology based on a foundation of service management aligned with data integration, data provisioning, system support, and security operations. These operational processes are measured clearly through a framework of key performance indicators, which seek to provide an optimal level of transparency and control.
We have implemented a rigorous command and control structure for maintaining availability of production systems and ensuring the security of technology infrastructure. Our NOC is responsible for monitoring network and systems, security incident response, and management and communication as well as the oversight of planned system maintenance. The personnel of the NOC are also responsible for invoking our business continuity plan when appropriate.
The security operations within our NOC maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our production systems and technology infrastructure by maintaining security situational awareness, as well as coordinating security incident response and proactively protecting sensitive data. The security operations team utilizes a variety of tools and techniques to identify, contain, remediate, and gather intelligence on both known and emerging technology threats. Reports are tracked through automated event management triggers and communicated to leadership through our business service management layer.
We have a comprehensive framework for managing change control, problem management, incident and event management, service management, and production operations. We use a defined quality change control management system for managing technology changes.
Product support integration across all of our solutions enables commonality of processes—allowing our clients to benefit from increased technology operational efficiencies. Regardless of the efficiencies achieved, we are continuously enhancing our technology product operations through the dedication of the process automation and performance assurance team focused on designing and deploying zero-touch capabilities.
Services Operations Group
Many of our clients utilize the analytical outputs of our platform to feed into their own internal systems to achieve value within the provider and patient base. Other clients license our data-driven intervention platforms to facilitate the realization of value from our analytics. For still other clients, our service support personnel operate our data-driven intervention platforms to deliver end-to-end value realization. For these clients, through the implementation of our sophisticated platforms, we leverage our analytical output to provide data-driven intervention support services at the varying points of care necessary to achieve the goals of our clients. This unique end-to-end approach implements the solutions necessary to turn insight generated through our advanced analytics into meaningful impact and realized value for our clients on a national scale.
One of the centerpieces of our services operations is our strong management systems, which serve as vehicles to drive transparency, ownership and execution. Our management systems enable general managers and operational leaders the ability to “see around the corner” and be ambidextrous in how they balance achieving efficiency gains while also focusing on exceptional client value delivery.
Competition
We compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. We believe the competitive landscape is highly fragmented with no single competitor offering similarly expansive capabilities and diverse platform solution offerings in healthcare data analytics, 
10

data-driven interventions, connectivity, and data visualization solutions. Our primary competitive challenge is to demonstrate to our existing and potential clients the value of utilizing our platforms rather than developing or assembling their own alternative capabilities. We believe that the combination of our competitive strengths and successful culture of innovation, including our large proprietary datasets, advanced data integration technologies, sophisticated predictive analytics, extensive industry connectivity, data-driven intervention platforms, and the deep subject matter expertise of our associates, make it time- and cost-prohibitive for our clients to replace or replicate all that we offer. In addition, we believe the combination of these attributes differentiates us from our competition.
The competitive landscape can be characterized by the following categories of companies that provide capabilities or solutions that compete with one or more offerings of our platform:

• | Large-scale healthcare-specific solutions providers, such as Optum, Change Healthcare (formerly Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc. and McKesson Technology Solutions), Verscend Technologies (formerly Verisk Health), and IQVIA (formerly QuintilesIMS);


• | Providers of enterprise-scale, industry agnostic IT solutions, such as Oracle, Dell, SAP, SAS, and IBM;


• | Large-scale IT consultants and third-party service providers, such as Accenture and Deloitte Consulting; and


• | Point solution providers, such as Change Healthcare, DST Systems, edifecs, and Silverlink.

Intellectual Property
We generally rely on copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements, licenses, and other agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, and customers. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary software, confidential information and know-how, technology, and other intellectual property. Historically, because our initial technological innovations were primarily algorithmic in nature, these innovations were well suited to trade secret protection. Accordingly, and due to the complex, time intensive, and costly patent process, with somewhat limited utility for business processes, the use of patents has not historically been compelling for us. However, beginning in the second quarter of 2015, we filed a limited number of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. We expect to continue to seek patents in the future.

Our Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 2,499 associates across the following areas: Technology, Innovation and Product, Data-driven Client Services, and Selling, General and Administrative. There were 2,104 full-time associates and 395 part-time associates. None of our associates are represented by a labor union; all of our associates currently work in the U.S. and its territories (Puerto Rico), and we consider our current relations with our associates to be good.
Requirements Regarding the Privacy and Security of Personal Information
HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements.    There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information (“PHI”) and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Our health plan customers, as well as healthcare clearinghouses and certain providers with which we have or may establish business relationships, are covered entities that are regulated under HIPAA. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and an implementing regulation known as the Omnibus Final Rule significantly expanded HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. Among other things, HITECH and the Omnibus Final Rule make HIPAA’s privacy and security 
11

standards directly applicable to “business associates,” which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are considered a “business associate” and thus are directly subject to HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. In order to provide our covered entity clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of PHI, HIPAA requires our clients to enter into business associate agreements with us. Such agreements must, among other things, require us to:

• | limit how we will use and disclose PHI;


• | implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse;


• | enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information;


• | report security incidents, breaches, and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and


• | assist the customer in question with certain of its duties under the privacy standards.

In addition to HIPAA, HITECH, and their implementing regulations, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws. Such laws prohibit unfair or deceptive privacy and security practices and/or place requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and data access. We may also be subject to state medical record privacy laws (sometimes more strict than HIPAA), including the laws of the state of California.
Data Protection and Breaches.    In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of individuals’ personal information. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. Under HIPAA and pursuant to our business associate agreement obligations, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners upon discovery. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and the media.
We have implemented and maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards intended to protect individually identifiable health information. We have controls in place to assist us in complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual requirements regarding the protection of these data. We have established processes that allow us to properly respond to any security breaches or incidents. 
In many cases, applicable state laws, including breach notification requirements, are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy and security standards and are subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thereby complicating our compliance efforts. Where a state law is not preempted by HIPAA, we may also be subject to that state law’s requirements, in addition to our obligations under HIPAA, HITECH, and their implementing regulations. Additionally, state and federal laws regarding deceptive practices may apply to public assurances we provide to individuals about the security of services we provide on behalf of our contractual customers.
Other Requirements.    In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. federal and state laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information and healthcare provider information. Some states are also considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy, and security of medical records or other types of medical information. Further, Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
Seasonality
The nature of our customers’ end-market results in partial seasonality reflected in both revenue and cost of revenue differences during the year. Regulatory impact of data submission deadlines in, for example, January, March, June, and September drive some degree of predictable timing of analytics and data processing activity variances from quarter to quarter. Further, regulatory clinical encounter deadlines of June 30th and December 31st drive predictable intervention concentrations variances from quarter to quarter. The timing of these factors results in analytical and intervention activity mix variances, which have limited predictable impact in the aggregate on our financial performance from quarter to quarter. However, quarter to quarter financial performance may increasingly vary from historical seasonal trends as we continue to expand into adjacent markets and increase the portion of our revenue generated from new offerings. Further, we also expect the impact of seasonality to decrease over time as we expand our mix of revenue generated from a subscription-based model. The timing of new contract signings and their respective implementations can also lead to variances in our seasonal revenue performance.
