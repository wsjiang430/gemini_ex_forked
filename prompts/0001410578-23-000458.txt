Since its inception, Alliance has made nine accretive business acquisitions, including Phantom Sound and Vision, MSI Music, Infinity Resources, Alliance, ANConnect, Mecca Electronics, Distribution Solutions, Mill Creek, and COKeM.

Alliance believes the three pillars of its business; Service, Selection, and Technology create a powerful competitive advantage that will protect the Company’s market leadership and propel its future growth into the evolving physical entertainment product segments.

Industry Background
The industries in which the Company participates are:

● | Packaged Goods consisting of physical media and entertainment content;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Gaming Consoles and Accessories; and
--+-------------------------------------


● | Toys and Collectibles.
--+-----------------------

The background components within the physical media and entertainment industry are as follows:
Vinyl Records
The Company expects vinyl sales to increase over the next five years. Industry wide, vinyl sales surpassed CD sales. Revenue in the industry from vinyl grew to $1.0 billion in 2021 and accounts for 63% of physical entertainment sales dollars. The market is expected to grow by $563.97 million from 2021 to 2025. The expected CAGR is 8.41% during the same period.
The largest market in terms of record sales is the United States followed by the United Kingdom, France, Japan, and Germany.
Alliance believes that the growth in vinyl is being driven by millennial consumers. It is economically priced, more accessible and has better audio quality, according to some experts.
Gaming Products
The gaming industry shows strong growth over the next few years from 2021 to 2026. The gaming industry was valued at $173.7 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $314.4 billion by 2026. The CAGR is 9.64% over the forecast period from 2021 to 2026. Contributing factors include more people staying home than before and emerging technologies in gaming such as cloud, AR, VR and AI.
The global user base for AR and VR gaming is estimated to increase to 216 million users by 2025.
Consumer Products and Collectibles
The market for consumer products/collectibles shows steady growth over the next few years. The collectibles market is expected to grow by $1.24 billion during the period of 2021 to 2025. The CAGR is over 4% for the forecast period. Toys and collectibles (Funko, Mattel, Hasbro, Lego, Playmobil, action figures) capitalize on the social trend of facilitating creative play while reducing screen time.

Compact Discs
Vinyl continues to surpass CD sales. CD Revenues in the US in 2021 were $584 million. Sales in the United States have dropped from 122.9 million shipments in 2015 to only 31.6 million shipments in 2021. Alliance historically over-indexes the industry compared to CD revenues in the United States due to its Amped division adding more exclusive labels to distribute.
DVD and Blu-Ray
Disc versions of video game consoles allow those users access to play the disc version of movies. Broadband speeds are not always ideal for high quality streaming even in developed countries. This problem is worse in developing countries. However, factors such as access to digital copies of films, and on-demand streaming services have caused DVD sales to decline.
Shipments are expected to decrease from 46.6 million in 2019 to 16.1 million in 2025. Forecast for unit shipments shows an overall decline of 16.2% CAGR from 2019 – 2025.
DVD’s biggest competitor, the online streaming services market is expected to grow by $191.72 billion during 2021 – 2025 with a CAGR of 18%.
Alliance historically over-indexes the industry compared to DVD and BluRay revenues in the United States because of Distribution Solution’s division adding more exclusive studio products to distribute.
Market Opportunity
The Company has identified two primary market areas where it currently conducts business and plans to grow its business:
Content Media

● | The global content media market is expected to grow from $289.13 billion in 2021 to $308.97 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 6.9%. The film and music market growth are mainly due to the companies rearranging their operations and recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The market is expected to reach $392.34 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 6%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Despite the rise of digital distribution models, 64% of console consumers still prefer to buy their games on disc.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The global animation collectibles market is poised to grow by $1.24 billion during 2021 – 2025, progressing at a CAGR of over 4% during the same period.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fulfillment

● | The global e-commerce fulfillment services market size was valued at $77.57 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% from 2021 to 2028 ($168.72 billion).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consumer electronics is expected to emerge as the fastest-growing segment registering a CAGR of over 12% from 2021 to 2028.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The market is anticipated to witness substantial growth during the period due to the proliferation of the e-commerce industry, especially in emerging markets leading to an unprecedented rise in the number of online buyers. This trend implies North America will not grow as quickly as other global segments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | It is anticipated that fulfilment in North America will continue to be funneled into established brands (for example, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and Target).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5




● | The global third-party logistics market was valued at $1,032 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to reach $1,656.7 billion by the year 2027. The market is anticipated to register a CAGR of 8.2% over the same period.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Retailers and manufacturers are increasing their focus on core competencies to sustain the intense competition in their respective markets. Due to this, they are outsourcing their other supporting activities to third party vendors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Significant barriers to entry and market leadership. Alliance is a leader in fulfillment and e-commerce distribution with over 425,000 SKUs in stock.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppliers
Alliance distributes and markets over 600,000 products worldwide from approximately 400 of the industry’s premier physical media entertainment products suppliers. Typically, it maintains over 425,000 SKUs of unique items in its on-hand inventory.
For the six months ended December 31, 2022, there were 23 suppliers in the top 80% of Alliance’s purchase expenditures and five suppliers representing approximately 48%. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, there were 26 suppliers in the top 80% of Alliance’s product purchases by expenditures. The top five suppliers as a group represented 53 % of its purchase expenditures. No single supplier comprised more than 15% of Alliance’s total purchases for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Alliance has written supply agreements with many of its suppliers and these agreements usually provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and often include territorial restrictions that limit the countries, and in some cases certain channels, in which it may distribute the products. Some of Alliance’s agreements with suppliers may contain limitations of liability with respect to our suppliers’ obligations and warranties. Historically, warranty expense has not been material.
The agreements also are generally short-term, subject to annual renewal, and in some cases contain provisions permitting termination by either party without cause upon relatively short notice. Certain supply agreements either require (at our option) or allow for the repurchase of inventory upon termination of the agreement. In cases in which suppliers are not obligated to accept inventory returns upon termination, some suppliers will nevertheless elect to repurchase the inventory while other suppliers will assist with either liquidation or resale of the inventory.
Customers
Alliance has over 4,000 customers shipping to over 35,000 storefronts and service over 2,000 independent music and video retailers.
It conducts business with most of the leading retailers of entertainment products and services around the world. Alliance serves a customer base that is divided into categories including retailers, direct marketers, Internet-based resellers, independent dealers, product category specialists and other distributors. Management believes that many of its customers are heavily dependent on Alliance as a partner with the necessary systems, capital, inventory availability, and distribution and facilities in place to provide fulfillment and other services. Alliance tries to reduce our exposure to the impact of business fluctuations by maintaining a balance in the customer categories we serve.
In most cases Alliance conducts business with our customers under our general terms and conditions, without minimum purchase requirements. It also has resale contracts with some of its reseller customers that are terminable at will after a reasonable notice period and have no minimum purchase requirements. Alliance typically ships products on the same day it receives and accepts customers’ 

7



purchase orders. Unless otherwise requested, substantially all of Alliance’s products are delivered by common freight carriers. Backlog is usually not material to its business because orders are generally filled shortly after acceptance.
Alliance has specific agreements in place with certain suppliers and resellers in which it provides supply chain management services such as order management, technical support, call center services, forward and reverse logistics management, and procurement management services. These agreements generally may be terminated by either party without cause following reasonable notice.
For the year ended June 30, 2022, Alliance’s top five customers represented approximately 47% of its consolidated revenue. Alliance’s top customer represented 19% of its consolidated net sales.
None of the Company’s customer contracts exceed a one-year term, with most contracts having auto-renewal clauses.
Our Business is Affected by Seasonality
Alliance experiences some seasonal fluctuation in demand in our business. For instance, Alliance typically sees lower demand, particularly in Europe, in the summer months. The Company also normally sees an increase in demand in the September-to-December period, driven primarily by pre-holiday impacts on stocking levels in the retail channel for its North American business.
How We Manage Our Inventory
Alliance strives to maintain sufficient quantities of product inventories to achieve optimum order fill rates. Alliance’s business, like that of other distributors, is subject to the risk that the value of our inventory will be impacted adversely by suppliers’ price reductions or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising the inventory. It is the policy of many suppliers to offer distributors limited protection from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or a supplier’s price reductions. When protection is offered, the distributor may be restricted to a designated period of time in which products may be returned for credit or exchanged for other products or during which price protection credits may be claimed. Alliance continually takes various actions, including monitoring inventory levels and controlling the timing of purchases, to maximize its protection under supplier programs and reduce inventory risk. However, no assurance can be given that current protective terms and conditions will continue or that they will adequately protect Alliance against declines in inventory value, or that they will not be revised in such a manner as to adversely impact Alliance’s ability to obtain price protection. Alliance is subject to the risk that inventory values may decline, and supplier agreements may not adequately cover the decline in values. Alliance manages these risks through pricing and continual monitoring of existing inventory levels relative to customer demand, reflecting its forecasts of future demand and market conditions. On an ongoing basis, Alliance reduces inventory values for excess and obsolescence to assist in the liquidation of impacted inventories. Music CD’s and Video Movies are 100% returnable back to Alliance’s suppliers. Products that have exclusive distributions for Amped and Distribution Solutions are not owned by Alliance and are treated as consignment as for ownership and title.
Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due, in part, to differences in actual demand from that forecasted when orders were placed, the addition of new suppliers or new product lines with current suppliers, expansion into new product areas and strategic purchases of inventory. In addition, payment terms with inventory suppliers may vary from time to time and could result in fewer inventories being financed by suppliers and a greater amount of inventory being financed by our own capital. Our payment patterns can be influenced by incentives, such as early pay discounts offered by suppliers.
Sales and Marketing
Alliance’s product management and marketing groups help create demand for Alliance’s suppliers’ products and services, enable the launch of new products, and facilitate customer contact. Our marketing programs are tailored to meet specific supplier and customer needs. These needs are met through a wide offering of services by our in-house marketing organization, including advertising, market research, online marketing, retail programs, sales promotions, training, and solutions marketing. In addition, Alliance creates and utilizes specialized channel marketing communities to deliver focused resources and business building support to solution providers.

For its DTC division, the Company deploys performance marketing strategies through digital and offline channels to drive additional traffic and transactions from high-intent prospective customers. To increase the efficiency of its performance marketing initiatives, the Company utilizes a Customer Relationship management platform, which provides further opportunities to personalize marketing campaigns and target advertising to specific market segments. Alliance complements its brand and performance marketing with nurture initiatives through email and outbound communications to ensure the Company retains high-value customers, increases brand loyalty, and drives recurring transactions.
The Company’s marketing strategy includes brand performance, and viral marketing. Brand marketing, which may also include the Company’s presence on social media platforms, increases awareness among potential customers, helping them understand the benefits of using Alliance’s platforms.
In addition to brand, and performance marketing, Alliance engages in traditional public relations and communications activities, such as trade show participation, to strengthen its brand and enable it to be less reliant on performance marketing, reducing the Company’s customer acquisition costs. The Company’s communications team works across press and policy channels to share timely and important news about the Company. They also oversee the execution of a consumer, product, corporate, and policy communications plan that supports Alliance’s brand strategy.
Competition
Alliance faces competition from a variety of competitors, including some of our own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market, wholesale distributors, retailers, and internet-based businesses. We are a leading company in the sale and marketing of physical media entertainment products, including vinyl, gaming, DVDs, CD’s and consumer products and toys offerings, and operate in the competitive e-commerce business environment. We compete with several smaller physical media companies in our product categories, as well as with many larger e-commerce companies in the United States and internationally.
In addition, we compete with entertainment companies that digitally download and stream their products. Competition is based primarily on meeting consumer product preferences and on the quality and play value of our physical media products and experiences. To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product pricing.
Many of the major entertainment and gaming companies are part of large, diversified companies with a variety of other operations. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase entertainment revenues and streaming placement. In addition, the resources of the major entertainment producers may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including media content, that we might also be interested in acquiring. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our products or pay more for third party content, any of which could harm our business.
The changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to entertainment and barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies and different mediums for viewing content, such as the growing number of streaming platform options, continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups to develop products and offerings that compete with our entertainment and e-commerce offerings. In the future, the Company may face increased competition through the emergence of new competitors or business models. Some of Alliance’s competitors may have access to significant financial resources, greater name recognition and well-established client bases in their target customer segments, differentiated business models, technology and other capabilities, or a differentiated geographic coverage, which may make it more difficult for Alliance to attract new customers.
Intellectual Property
Alliance’s intellectual property is an important component of its business. The Company relies on a combination of domain names, trademarks, copyright, know-how and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to protect its intellectual property. As of December 31, 2022, Alliance has no active patents or patent applications, but intends to pursue patent protection to the extent it believes it would be beneficial and cost effective.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned 32 U.S. registered or pending trademarks and registered or pending trademarks in two other jurisdictions. Alliance also owns over 300 domain names including www.deepdiscount.com, www.aent.com, www.cokem.com, www.importcds.com, www.ds.aent.com, and www.ampeddistribution.com.

The Company relies on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain its competitive advantage. Alliance seeks to protect its trade secrets and confidential information through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees, third parties, and others who may have access to the Company’s proprietary information. Alliance also requires key employees to sign invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from their employment and restrict unauthorized access to the Company’s proprietary technology. In addition, Alliance has developed proprietary, AI-driven software that is protected through a combination of copyright and trade secrets.
Notwithstanding the Company’s efforts to protect its intellectual property, there can be no assurance the measures taken will be effective or that its intellectual property will provide any competitive advantage. Alliance can provide no assurance that any patents will be issued from its pending applications or any future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect its proprietary technology. The Company’s intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Furthermore, the laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, as a result, Alliance may be unable to protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights in certain jurisdictions. In addition, while the Company has confidence in the measures it takes to protect and preserve its trade secrets, it cannot guarantee these measures will not be circumvented, or that all applicable parties have executed confidentiality or invention assignment agreements. In addition, such agreements can be breached, and may not have adequate remedies should any such breach occur. Accordingly, Alliance’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, Alliance had approximately 786 employees on its payroll and approximately 410 workers hired through staffing agencies throughout the U.S. and internationally.
As of June 30, 2022, Alliance had approximately 797 employees on its payroll and approximately 332 workers hired through staffing agencies throughout the U.S. and internationally.
None of Alliance’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and Alliance believes it has a good relationship with its employees.
Employees & Demographics. With respect to global demographics, approximately 47% of the Company’s payroll employees are female and 53% are male.
Talent & Turnover. With a focus on talent acquisition, the leadership team seeks out the most qualified candidates for open roles and endeavors to keep them at Alliance. Alliance has a robust program for seeking out those candidates, which ranges from sourcing through talent applications, reviewing direct applicants and using internal referrals to fill roles. Additionally, Alliance strives to promote internally when possible.
Alliance’s program resulted in an annualized turnover rate of 15% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.
Compensation Practice & Pay Equality. As Alliance evolves and expands operations, Human Resources, in partnership with the leadership team, will continue to evaluate the existing workforce to ensure that best practices are maintained across the entire team without risk of inequality. Pay structures for hourly employees are reviewed annually and for all other employees, compensation is benchmarked according to the position when a vacancy becomes available. This ensures best practices in a competitive market and, as part of that review, compensation will be realigned where appropriate for existing employees and new hires.
Health, Safety & Welfare. Alliance acted quickly to respond to safety protocols as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to protect the health and safety of its team members. To support team members, Alliance provided temporary pay increases to certain employees, offered remote work where possible, purchased additional sanitation supplies and increased personal protective materials provided to staff.
Regulatory Compliance
The Company’s overall business approach and strategy includes rigorous attention to regulatory compliance, as its operations are subject to regulations in the following principal areas, across a wide variety of jurisdictions. Alliance’s business is subject to a wide 

10



array of laws, regulations, and standards in each domestic and foreign jurisdiction where we operate. Alliance has a buying office in the UK and operates under the name Fulfillment Express. Fulfillment Express sources music from the UK music suppliers that is then transferred (exported from the United Kingdom) to Kentucky where that music product is prepared to sell in the US market. Fulfillment Express makes no sales of any kind, it only is a buying office.
The regulatory environment in each market is often complex, evolving and can be subject to significant change. Some relevant laws and regulations are inconsistent, ambiguous and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied to an innovative hospitality provider such as Alliance, which often makes their application to its business uncertain. For additional information regarding the laws and regulations that affect the Company’s business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Privacy and Data Protection Regulation
In processing purchase transactions and information about customers, the Company receives and stores a large volume of personally identifiable data. The collection, storage, processing, transfer, use, disclosure and protection of this information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and variations and implementations of that regulation in the member states of the European Union, as well as privacy and data protection laws and regulations in various U.S. states and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), and the UK General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act.
Alliance incorporates a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data within the Company’s platforms and business services, including personally identifiable data pertaining to guests and employees, and Alliance is engaged in an ongoing process of evaluating and considering additional steps to maintain compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act, GDPR, PIPEDA, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and the UK Data Protection Act.
Employment Laws
The Company is also subject to laws governing its relationship with employees, including laws governing wages and hours, benefits, immigration and workplace safety and health.
Other Regulation
Alliance’s business is subject to various other laws and regulations, involving matters such as income tax and other taxes, consumer protection, online messaging, advertising, and marketing, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws governing bribery and other corrupt business activities, and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering or prohibiting business activities with specified countries or persons. As the Company expands into additional markets, it will be subject to additional laws and regulations.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. We also maintain a website at www.aent.com. Through the Investors Relations section of our website, we make available, free of charge, annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this annual report.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “ emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on 

11



executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) of 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equals or exceeds $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
