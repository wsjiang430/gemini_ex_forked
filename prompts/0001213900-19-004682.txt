Organization
 
Drone Aviation Holding Corp. has two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Lighter Than Air Systems Corp. (“LTAS”) and Drone AFS Corp. (“AFS”). Drone Aviation Holding Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on April 17, 2014, as a wholly owned subsidiary of MacroSolve, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation (“MacroSolve”), and effective April 30, 2014, in order to consolidate our operations into an entity incorporated in Nevada, MacroSolve merged with and into us. On June 3, 2014, we acquired Drone Aviation Corp. through a share exchange transaction, and on March 26, 2015, Drone Aviation Corp. merged with and into us. As a result of the share exchange and merger with Drone Aviation Corp., we acquired Drone Aviation Corp.’s subsidiary, LTAS. AFS became our subsidiary upon its formation on July 9, 2015. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company,” as used in this Annual Report refer to Drone Aviation Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 11651 Central Parkway #118, Jacksonville, Florida 32224 and our phone number is (904) 834-4400.
 
Business Overview
 
We design, develop, market and sell specialized tethered aerial monitoring and communications platforms serving national defense and security customers for use in applications including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (“ISR”) and communications. We focus primarily on the development of a tethered aerostat known as the Winch Aerostat Small Platform (“WASP”) and have developed and sold tethered drone products, including the WATT electric drone and the FUSE Tether System designed for the DJI Matrice 200 (M200) professional drones. Our products are primarily designed for military and security applications where they can provide secure and reliable aerial monitoring for extended durations while being tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether.
Products
 
WASP TACTICAL AEROSTATS
 
The WASP tethered aerostat system includes the WASP and WASP Lite, lighter-than-air (LTA), compact tactical aerostat platforms that are either self-contained on a trailer that can be towed by a military all-terrain vehicle, or “MATV,” or mine resistant ambush protected vehicle (“MRAP”) or other standard vehicle, operated from the bed of a pickup truck or mounted to a building rooftop. They are designed to provide semi-persistent, mobile, real-time day/night high definition video for ISR, detection of improvised explosive devices, border security and other governmental and civilian uses. All our products can also be utilized for disaster response missions by supporting two-way and cellular communications and acting as a repeater or provider of wireless networking. 
 
The aerostat systems have a tethered envelope filled with helium gas and carry either a stabilized ISR or communications payload, portable ground control station and a datalink between the ground station and the envelope. Hovering between 500 and at up to 1,500 feet above the ground, the systems provide surveillance, electronic warfare and communications capabilities with relatively low acquisition and maintenance costs.  The systems require an operational crew of a minimum of two personnel, relatively simple maintenance procedures, and feature quick retrieval and helium top-off for re-inflation.

The WASP is a mobile, tactical-sized aerostat capable of carrying a variety of payloads in support of military operations helping troops in the field gain a tactical edge while communicating over greater distances. The WASP leverages aerostat technology to elevate network payloads up to 90 pounds to an advantaged height of up to 1,500 feet, to enable persistent network connectivity while reducing risk to units conducting missions. U.S. Army-owned WASP tactical aerostats have successfully completed a number of field tests and exercises including the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) Enterprise Challenge, Stormforce, and various Army Network Integration Evaluations, which allows the U.S. Government to evaluate, among other things, the WASP’s ability to provide secure communications and capture and relay real-time, high definition video to various handheld devices, tablet computers and other deployed systems. In October 2016, we were awarded contracts from a U.S. Government customer to integrate advanced communication solutions and optical payloads into their WASP aerostats which were delivered in March 2017. In October 2017 and October 2018, we were awarded contracts from a U.S. Government customer for our WASP tactical aerostat and spare parts, which were delivered in February 2018 and December 2018, respectively. In December 2018, we were awarded a contract from a U.S. Government customer which we expect to begin delivering late in the second quarter of 2019. Due to the recent Government shutdown which furloughed the staff required to approve our disclosure of contract details, we have not yet been able to provide all the specifics of this new relationship beyond what is discussed below in the Recent Developments section. Building upon a 10-year relationship with our U.S. Government customers, we will continue to support the U.S. Army-owned WASP systems for future operations and exercises.
 
The WASP Lite is a newly developed system that utilizes the proven fieldability of our larger WASP aerostat system incorporated into a small footprint design. It is a compact, non-trailer based, cost effective aerostat system that is highly mobile and can be setup and deployed virtually anywhere from the bed of pickup to a rooftop while anchored or moored. WASP Lite can move while deployed up to 40 mph and supports a wide range of lighter payloads including ISR, communications, and signal intelligence (SIGINT). We are currently engaged in flight testing and operational training with a DoD customer and working with other potential customers to demonstrate WASP Lite’s rapidly deployable, highly mobile, persistent ISR and communications capabilities.
 
OTHER TETHERED PRODUCTS
 
The Company has produced and sold in limited quantities other tethered aerial products including the electric-powered WATT and BOLT tethered drones and the FUSE Tether System.


WATT was our first model of a new line of commercial-grade powered tethered drones designed to provide secure and reliable aerial monitoring for extended durations while being connected to a ground-based, software-controlled winch via a safe and secure armored tether line. The concept of the tethered drone system is built on the strength of our experience in developing tethered solutions for our aerostat products and combining that with the advantages of multi-rotor copters. The result is a robust capability designed to be used in almost all-weather environments and controlled with the push of a button. The WATT is designed to take off, hover and land via remote control while connected by a proprietary tether technology where all data, controls and endurance are built into the tether. The same components and systems that our military customers rely on in our launcher systems are being incorporated into the self-contained copter system in order to produce a heavier-than-air, tethered product. WATT is designed to hover in a stationary position directly above its launch site at one of several preset altitudes of up to 300 feet for up to 8 hours while a highly-stabilized military-grade/broadcast quality HD video image can provide a 360° live aerial monitoring feed directly through the tether to its host vehicle or to a network of mobile devices, such as tablets or laptop computers. Compact and lightweight, the WATT system features the ability to draw power from either its host vehicle or independently provide up to 8 hours of operation through its own ground power equipment and is specially designed to be transported and deployed from commercial vehicles using its standard 120-volt adapter. Although a contract for WATT from a U.S. Government customer was awarded in September 2016 and delivered in December 2016, the Company believes it is a niche product and, as such, has focused our development and marketing efforts on the WASP systems.
 
Another electric tethered drone we announced in 2016 is called the BOLT. BOLT is designed to meet a wide range of military and commercial applications requiring persistent, heavy lift capabilities. The BOLT coaxial tethered helicopter delivers rapid setup, high mobility and whisper-quiet operations at altitudes of up to 800 feet. BOLT has a field changeable universal payload bay which supports radio, signals intelligence, or “SIGINT,” and ISR packages of up to 15 pounds and requiring up to 1 kilowatt of power. The Company continues to respond to interest from a select number of potential customers since the introduction and plans to complete development and custom manufacture each vehicle based on order specifications it receives in the future.

In May 2017 we introduced the FUSE Tether System which is an automated smart winch tethering system designed to meet the unique specifications for DJI professional drones, specifically, the Matrice 200 series. Utilizing our patent-pending power pack, DJI users can dramatically and affordably increase flight time with uninterrupted power from the ground via a tether and winch.
 
At present, consistent with our efforts to focus on our aerostat products, we are limiting investment in, or pursuit of, additional business development activity for our other tethered products to responses to direct inquiries from our existing customers.
 
Market
 
The market for our LTA advanced aerostats and tethered drones has grown significantly over the last several years and has seen interest increase significantly following the adoption of new commercial drone regulations (Part 107) adopted by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) at the end of August 2016 because our tethered drone product line is designed to comply with the FAA’s regulations. The military has transformed into a smaller, more agile fighting force in need of a network of technologies to provide improved observation, communication and precision targeting of combat troop locations, which are often embedded in dense population centers or dispersed in remote locations.  Our products provide critical observation and communication capabilities serving the increased demand for ISR and communications, including real-time tactical reconnaissance, tracking, combat assessment and geographic data, while reducing the risks to our troops in theatre. Finally, in a highly constrained fiscal environment, we believe the typically lower acquisition and use/maintenance costs of LTA advanced aerostats and tethered drones make them more appealing compared to their heavier than air manned or larger LTA unmanned system alternatives. 
 
The markets for our systems on a stand-alone basis and/or combined with other payloads relates to the following applications, among others:
 
Governmental Markets:
 

● | International, federal, state and local governments and agencies thereof, including DoD, U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, U.S. Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. and state Departments of Transportation, penitentiaries, and police forces; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Military, including the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and U.S. Air Force installations; 
● | ISR, including the United States Special Operations Forces; 
● | Border security monitoring, including U.S. Homeland Security, to deter and detect illegal entry; 
● | Drug enforcement along U.S. borders; 
● | Monitoring environmental pollution and sampling air emissions; and 
● | Vehicle traffic monitoring, including aerial speed enforcement by state and local law enforcement agencies. 

Commercial Markets:
 

● | TV and media production mobile communications systems, expanding on-site reporting capabilities to include aerial videography and photography;

Distribution
 
We sell our products directly to end customers and through distribution agreements with firms such as ADS Inc., a leading value-added logistics and supply chain solutions provider that serves the U.S. military, federal, state and local government organizations, law enforcement agencies, first responders, partner nations and the defense industry. In addition, we sell our products through several prime contractors and our products are included in the U.S. Government’s GSA Schedule, which allows government customers to directly negotiate and acquire products and services from commercially-listed suppliers.
Competition
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets for the Company’s tethered systems (aerostat and drones) include product performance, features, acquisition cost, lifetime operating cost, including maintenance and support, ease of use, integration with existing equipment, size, mobility, quality, reliability, customer support, brand and reputation.  
 
Our proprietary and recently patented tethering technology, in particular, our tension control winch system, is an important competitive differentiator in the market. The winch systems utilized in our products have undergone extensive testing and continued refinement through coordination with customers, including the U.S. Army.
 
We believe the current market competitors to the WASP aerostat system include a large number of companies ranging from small “mom and pop” tethered aerostat and balloon companies to large defense contractors, including TCOM, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, ISL, ILC Dover, Compass Systems, Raven Aerostar, American Blimp Corporation, and RT Aerostat Systems, Inc., the American subsidiary of Israeli aerostat company RT LTA. We believe there are numerous commercial drone companies, such as DJI and Parrot, offering free flying drones for pleasure and commercial use, as well as many larger drone manufactures, such as Northrop Grumman, AeroVironment, Inc. and Boeing, offering military grade free flying drones to the U.S. Government, which could compete with the WASP. There are very few commercial grade tethered drone competitors for our WATT tethered drone system that remain tethered to the ground via a high strength armored tether, including Aria Insights (formerly Cyphy Works Inc.) located in Danvers, MA, Elistair located in Lyon, France, Hoverfly Technologies, Inc. located in Orlando, Florida, and Skysapience located in Yokneam, Israel.
 
Many of our LTA aerostat competitors have received considerable funding from government or government-related sources to develop and build LTA aerostats.  Most of these organizations and many of our other competitors have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and sales resources and capabilities than we do. We anticipate increasing competition as a result of defense industry consolidation, which has enabled companies to enhance their competitive position and ability to compete against us.  In addition, other companies may introduce competing aerostats or solutions based on alternative technologies that may adversely affect our competitive position.  As a result, our products may become less or non-competitive or obsolete. For further discussion of certain risks relating to competition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
 
Technology, Research and Development
 
We conduct the development, commercialization and manufacturing of our products in-house at our facility in Jacksonville, Florida. 
 
Our research and development efforts are largely focused on the LTA aerostat systems, including management and recovery of helium gas. We have developed an aerostat system called WASP LITE for use in commercial or governmental applications which do not require the same level of durability and ruggedness as the WASP, and we continue to work on different models with different payloads for various applications.

The concept of the powered drone systems is built on the strength of our years of developing tethered solutions for our LTA aerostat products combined with the advantages of rotor copters. The result is a robust product designed to be utilized in almost all-weather environments and controlled with the push of a button. Our tethered drones are designed to take off, hover and land via remote control all while being connected by a unique tether technology where all data, controls and endurance are built into the tether. The same components and systems that our military customers rely on from our launcher systems are incorporated into our self-contained tethered drone systems in order to produce a unique heavier than air, tethered product offering.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we spent $107,015 and for the year ended December 31, 2017, we spent $351,768 on research and development activities. Research and development expenditures are not borne directly by customers nor are the costs accounted for in our pricing models. Throughout 2019, we do not anticipate significant increases in research and development expenses from levels reported in 2018 as we focus activities on continual, incremental improvement to the WASP platform in order to increase its features and capabilities.
 
Strategic Partners 
 
We are party to several agreements with strategic partners and distributors to assist us with the marketing and sales of various products, as we currently have limited in-house sales capabilities. Current relationships include:

● | A sales and distribution partnership with U.S. government prime contractor ADS Inc.; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | An exclusive teaming agreement with a non-affiliate U.S. government prime contractor; 

Intellectual Property
 
On September 18 and 19, 2014, we filed provisional patent application numbers “62/052,289” and “62/052,946” entitled “Tethered Portable Aerial Media broadcast System” based on the tethered drone system. On September 18, 2015, we filed a utility patent application claiming a priority date of the two provisional patent applications and having application Serial Number “14858467” entitled “Apparatus and Methods for Tethered Aerial Platform and System.” On July 7, 2015, we filed a provisional patent application number “62/189,341” entitled “Apparatus, Methods and System for Tethered Aerial Platform.” On September 20, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued patent number 9,446,858 entitled “Apparatus and methods for tethered aerial platform and system.” This new patent on our electric tethered aerial platform (“ETAP”) technologies covers the core systems currently incorporated into the WATT and BOLT products. 
 
On April 19, 2016, we filed an application for registration of the trademark “Taming Altitude”. On August 7, 2018, the USPTO issued trademark number 5,532,648 entitled “Taming Altitude”.
 
In addition, the Company’s intellectual property portfolio includes an exclusive commercial license to vision-based navigation and advanced autonomous flight management software that it acquired in 2015 and exclusive commercial licenses to a number of unmanned vehicle technologies developed by Georgia Tech Research Corporation, including “GUST” (Georgia Tech UAV Simulation Tool) autopilot system.

Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. As we continue the development of our aerial products, we expect that we will rely on patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions. We have also registered the trademark “Blimp in a Box.”  In certain cases, when appropriate, we opt to protect our intellectual property through trade secrets as opposed to filing for patent protection in order to preserve confidentiality.  All of our employees are subject to non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. For further discussion of risks relating to intellectual property, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. For further discussion about the intellectual property rights and licenses and minimum royalties, see Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes.
 
Dependence on a Few Customers and Regulatory Matters
 
We believe there is a large, growing market for our commercial tethered drones internationally as well as in the U.S. With the recently enacted guidelines for commercial drone use in the U.S. by the FAA (Part 107), we have witnessed a growing U.S. market for commercial drone applications that our tethered drones can serve. Until the FAA officially adopted and published these guidelines in late August 2016, we and our customers were restricted to operating our tethered aerial products in the National Air Space under either FAA granted exemptions or Certificates of Authorization. In addition to domestic opportunities, we are evaluating various international markets where the FAA does not control the airspace and where our tethered drones can potentially be operated. We anticipate that the majority of our LTA aerostat revenue at least in the foreseeable future will come from U.S. Government and Government-related entities, including the DoD and other departments and agencies.  Government programs that we may seek to participate in compete with other programs for consideration during Congress’s budget and appropriations hearings and may be affected by changes not only in political power and appointments, but also general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control.  Reductions, extensions or terminations in a program that we are seeking to participate in or overall defense spending or delays in Government funding such as occurred in late December 2018 which shutdown certain departments and agencies, could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and realize any profits.  We cannot predict whether potential changes in security, defense and intelligence priorities will afford opportunities for our business in terms of research and development or product contracts, but any reduction in government spending on such programs could negatively impact our ability to generate revenues.
 
We have registered as a contractor with the U.S. Government and are required to comply with and will be affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts.  Government contract laws and regulations affect how we will do business with customers, and in some instances, will impose added costs on our business.  A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of any then existing contracts, or the inability to bid on future contracts.  For further discussion of the risks relating to U.S. Government contracts and FAA rules and regulations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. For further discussion about our dependence on a few major customers see Note 15 – Concentrations in the Notes.
 
International sales of our products may also be subject to U.S. laws, regulations and policies like the U.S. Department of State restrictions on the transfer of technology, International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and other export laws and regulations and may be subject to first obtaining licenses, clearances or authorizations from various regulatory entities.   This may limit our ability to sell our products abroad and the failure to comply with any of these regulations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and generate revenues as well as increase our operating costs.  Our products may also be subject to regulation by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulate wireless communications
 
Sources and Availability of Components

Certain materials and equipment for our products are custom made for those products and are available only from a limited number of suppliers. Failure of a supplier could cause delays in delivery of the products if another supplier cannot promptly be found or if the quality of such replacement supplier’s components is inferior or unacceptable.  For further discussion of the risks relating to sources and availability of components, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.

Employees

We have 18 full-time and two part-time employees. Our executive management and accounting team are comprised of six of those full-time employees. We have no labor union contracts and believe relations with our employees are satisfactory.Recent Developments

Our marketing efforts include submission of bids on a several government procurement projects that we expect will be awarded in 2019. In the past, we also showcased our products and technologies at numerous conferences and live demonstrations, including the 2017 Special Operations Forces Industry Conference, Warrior Expo East and took part in a series of tests conducted on the southern border of the United States, State of Florida HURREX exercise, CyberQuest 2017, and presentations to a variety of federal and state government agencies. We have also increased marketing efforts and announced the following:

● | On January 31, 2019, we announced that we secured an additional $2.0 million in capital, completing a private placement raising an aggregate of $4.0 million which will be used to expand production and staffing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | On January 22, 2019, we announced the conclusion of training for a U.S. Army unit on the next generation WASP ERS tactical aerostat. The delivery of the $1.7 million dollar order itself was announced on October 15, 2018. 
● | On January 15, 2019, we announced the expansion of our manufacturing capacity. 
● | On January 8, 2019, we announced that we had been selected by a prime contractor in an exclusive relationship to receive an initial award valued at $3.8 million dollars. 
● | On December 27, 2018, we announced that we had eliminated over 70% of our existing debt in support of our planned growth. 
● | On November 8, 2018, we announced that our FUSE Tether System completed law enforcement flight operations at multiple large public events. 

Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection
 
In July 2018, we entered into an exclusive teaming agreement with a U.S. Government prime contractor which is the recipient of a previously awarded IDIQ (indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity) prime contract from of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”). Under the terms of the teaming agreement:

● | We will work together to propose retrofit and new production of surveillance systems developed under the prime contract; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We will provide the WASP aerostat, engineering support for WASP system integration, Field Service Representatives personnel support for WASP aerostat maintenance, training, WASP deployment, retrieval and movement, and warranty for WASP.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In December 2018, the prime contractor awarded us a subcontract valued at $3.8 million for six WASP aerostat systems, which we have previously announced. These WASP powered surveillance systems are expected to be deployed at a CBP Border Patrol Sector on the southern border of the United States. There are 20 Border Patrol Sectors along U.S. borders, 9 of which are located along the U.S. Southern border. We have begun production of the initial units at our facilities in Florida and at our ISO 9001-certified manufacturing partner’s facility. Deliveries are expected to begin late in the second quarter of 2019 and continue throughout 2019. We are working closely with the prime contractor to explore additional product and services opportunities in DHS and CBP under our exclusive teaming agreement.
