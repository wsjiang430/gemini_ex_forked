 Item 1.  Business
 OVERVIEW
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing medicines to improve the survival and quality of life of cancer patients. Both our marketed product, COPIKTRA™ (duvelisib) capsules, and most advanced product candidate, defactinib, utilize a multi-faceted approach designed to treat cancers originating either in the blood or major organ systems. We are currently developing our product candidates in both preclinical and clinical studies as potential therapies for certain cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, mesothelioma, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. We believe that these compounds may be beneficial as therapeutics either as single agents or when used in combination with immuno-oncology agents or other current and emerging standard of care treatments in aggressive cancers that are poorly served by currently available therapies.
 COPIKTRA is an oral inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and the first approved dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma, two enzymes known to help support the growth and survival of malignant B-cells. PI3K signaling may lead to the proliferation of malignant B-cells and is thought to play a role in the formation and maintenance of the supportive tumor microenvironment.  COPIKTRA was approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) on September 24, 2018 and is now indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) after at least two prior therapies and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies. The indication in FL is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate.  Continued approval for this FL indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefits in confirmatory trials.
 We are also developing duvelisib for the treatment of multiple types of cancer, the most advanced of which is designed to treat patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).  The development of duvelisib in PTCL has been awarded Fast Track status by the FDA and a registration study is underway. During 2019, we plan to continue to further develop duvelisib through the initiation of a confirmatory study of patients with FL and other sponsored trials. We also plan to report interim data for several ongoing investigator sponsored studies (ISTs).
 Our second product candidate, defactinib, is a targeted inhibitor of the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) signaling pathway. FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the Protein Tyrosine Kinase-2 (PTK-2) gene that is involved in cellular adhesion and, in cancer, metastatic capability.  Similar to COPIKTRA, defactinib is delivered orally and designed to be a potential therapy for patients to take at home under the advice of their physician. Defactinib is currently being investigated in combination with immunotherapeutic and other agents through ISTs. During 2019, we plan to report results from certain ongoing dose escalation combination studies involving this product.

 OUR FOCUS
 We are focused on the development and commercialization of small molecules for optimized efficacy and safety – primarily as orally available drugs and drug candidates that are designed to treat various forms of cancer. Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.  The American Cancer Society estimated that in the United States in 2018, approximately 1.7 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed and over 600,000 people died from the disease.  Current treatments for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy.  Notwithstanding years of intensive research and clinical use, these current treatments often fail to cure cancer.  For example, conventional chemotherapy works by stopping the function of cancer cells through a variety of mechanisms. Chemotherapies are usually not targeted at any specific differences between cancer cells and normal cells.  Rather, they kill cancer cells because cancer cells generally grow more rapidly than normal cells and, as a result, are relatively more affected by the chemotherapy than normal cells.  As a result, the treatments may succeed at initially decreasing tumor burden, but ultimately fail to kill all the cancer cells or effectively disrupt the tumor microenvironment, potentially resulting in eventual disease progression.
 Accordingly, cancer remains one of the world’s most serious health problems and is the second most common cause of death in the United States after heart disease.  The U.S. annual incidence, based on 2018 estimates from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (NCI; SEER), is that during the year there were approximately 75,000 new cases of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL), 234,000 new cases of lung cancer and 55,000 cases of pancreatic cancer. 
 With the application of new technologies and key discoveries, we believe that we are now entering an era of cancer research characterized by a more sophisticated understanding of the biology of cancer.  We believe that the potential of oral, targeted therapies, along with the rapidly advancing field of immunotherapy, or using the body’s immune system to fight cancer, are important new insights that present the opportunity to develop more effective cancer treatments.  Our goal is to develop targeted agents that both specifically kill cancer cells and disrupt the tumor microenvironment to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment. Agents that can modulate the tumor microenvironment to increase cytotoxic T-cell access to the tumor cells and decrease immunosuppressive T-cells in tumors have been sought after to increase the proportion of responding cancer patients and the duration of response (DOR) to cancer treatment.
 Our commercial product, COPIKTRA, and product candidate, defactinib, are currently used to treat, and are being evaluated for the treatment of, certain types of hematologic and solid cancers, including CLL/SLL, iNHL, T-cell lymphoma, lung cancer, mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other advanced cancers.
 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 
 Hematologic malignancies are cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as CLL/SLL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  In general, NHLs are a disease that occurs in patients over the age of 65. 
 The NCI estimates that the number of new incidences of CLL/SLL was 4.3 per 100,000 men and women per year based on 2011-2015 cases and that the five-year relative survival rate from 2008 to 2014 for patients with CLL/SLL was approximately 83%.  As CLL/SLL is generally a slow-growing disease, the advent of new oral anti-cancer therapies since 2013 has resulted in a significant advancement of treatment options beyond chemotherapy or anti-B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (CD20) immunotherapies, including ofatumumab.  For example, the Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors have demonstrable activity in the treatment of CLL/SLL.  However, evidence coming from studies on real-world use of these agents is revealing that a significant number of patients either relapse following treatment, become refractory to current agents, or are unable to tolerate treatment due to unmanageable side effects resulting from treatment, representing a significant medical need. 
  The five-year relative survival rate from 2008 to 2014 for patients with NHL was approximately 71%.  The type and stage of the lymphoma can often provide useful information about a person’s prognosis, but for some types of lymphomas the stage is less informative on its own.  In these cases, other factors can give doctors a better idea about a person’s prognosis.  These factors are included in the International Prognostic Index and other metrics,

which take into account the patient’s age, stage of disease, presence of metastases, performance status and blood levels of lactate dehydrogenase.
 The potential of additional oral agents, particularly as a monotherapy that can be used in the general community physician’s armamentarium, may hold significant value in the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL.   
 Follicular Lymphoma
 FL comprises 20% of all NHL and as much as 70% of the indolent lymphomas reported in American and European clinical trials.  Most patients with FL are age 50 years and older and present with widespread disease at diagnosis.  Nodal involvement is most common and is often accompanied by splenic and bone marrow disease.
 Despite the advanced stage, median survival for patients ranges from 8 to 15 years, leading to the designation of being indolent.  Patients with advanced-stage FL are not cured with current therapeutic options.  The rate of relapse is fairly consistent over time, even in patients who have achieved complete responses to treatment.
 There are various treatment options for FL based on the severity of associated symptoms and the rate of cancer growth.  If patients show no or very few symptoms, physicians may recommend not to treat the disease immediately, an approach referred to as “active surveillance” (also known as “watchful waiting”).  Active treatment is often started if the patient begins to develop lymphoma-related symptoms or there are signs that the disease is progressing based on testing during follow-up visits. 
 FL is generally responsive to radiation and chemotherapy upon initial diagnosis and treatment.  In more advanced stages, physicians may use one or more chemotherapy drugs or the monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan), alone or in combination with other agents, generally with decreasing responsiveness upon each additional relapse. 
 There have been only incremental advances in treatment options for FL beyond chemotherapy or immunotherapies like the antibodies against CD20, such as rituximab and obinutuzumab, and the overall clinical outlook for patients still remains poor.  In advanced disease, there are now several targeted therapies available including COPIKTRA, Aliqopa and Zydelig, which have similar mechanisms of action.  The use of an oral agent like COPIKTRA, particularly as a monotherapy that can be used in the general community physician’s armamentarium, may hold significant value for the treatment of patients with FL.   
 Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
 PTCL consists of a group of rare and usually aggressive (fast-growing) NHLs that develop from mature T-cells.  Most T-cell lymphomas are PTCLs, which collectively account for about 10% to 15% of all NHL cases in the United States.
 PTCLs are sub-classified into various subtypes, each of which are typically considered to be separate diseases based on their distinct clinical differences.  Most of these subtypes are very rare; the three most common subtypes of PTCL – peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) – account for approximately 60% of all PTCLs in the United States.
 For most subtypes of PTCL, the frontline treatment regimen is typically a combination chemotherapy, such as CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), EPOCH (etoposide, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, prednisone), or other multi-drug regimens.  Because most patients with PTCL will relapse, some oncologists recommend giving high-dose chemotherapy followed by an autologous stem cell transplant (during which patients receive their own stem cells) to some patients who had a positive response to their initial chemotherapy. Although promising, there is no firm clinical data to support that undergoing a transplant in this setting is better than not undergoing a transplant.

 The potential of additional oral agents, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer agents, that can be used in the general community physician’s armamentarium, may hold significant value in the treatment of patients with PTCL.
 Ovarian Cancer

Ovarian cancer forms in tissues of the ovary, one of a pair of female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are formed. Most ovarian cancers are either ovarian epithelial carcinoma, cancer that begins in the cells on the surface of the ovary, or malignant germ cell tumors that begin in egg cells. According to the NCI, epithelial carcinoma of the ovary is one of the most common gynecologic malignancies, with 50% of all cases occurring in women older than 65 years. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2019 there will be approximately 22,530 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed and approximately 13,980 ovarian cancer-related deaths.

Most patients are treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiation therapy. Surgery is often comprehensive, seeking to remove as much of the tumor as possible and may include removal of the ovaries or a total hysterectomy where the uterus is also removed. Unfortunately, available therapies are rarely curative in the treatment of ovarian cancer and many tumors become resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy, which is the primary treatment regimen. Further treatment with conventional chemotherapy is generally palliative, not curative, as the tumor is able to metastasize and spread to other sites in the body.
 Pancreatic Cancer
 In 2018, the NCI estimated that pancreatic cancer was the eleventh most common cancer diagnosed in the United States and that the disease represented the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the country.
 Pancreatic cancer often has a poor prognosis, even when diagnosed early.  Pancreatic cancer typically spreads rapidly and is seldom detected in its early stages, which is a major reason why it is a leading cause of cancer death.  Signs and symptoms may not appear until pancreatic cancer is so advanced that complete surgical removal is not possible.  Pancreatic cancer is one of the few cancers where survival has not improved significantly during the past 40 years.  Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality rate with approximately 91% of patients dying within five years of their initial diagnosis based on the five-year relative survival rate from 2008 to 2014.  The median age for diagnosis is 70 with the disease affecting males slightly more than females. 
 Treatment options for pancreatic cancer are limited with surgical resection of the tumor possible in less than 20% of patients.  Chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiation is offered to patients whose tumors are unable to be removed surgically.  Immuno-oncology agents have not demonstrated a significant improvement in treatment outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer.  The limited impact of chemotherapies and immunotherapies to improve the outcome may be due to the dense stroma that is prevalent in pancreatic tumors and the tumor microenvironment.  
 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
 According to the NCI, the most common types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.  Although NSCLCs are associated with cigarette smoke, adenocarcinomas may be found in patients who have never smoked.  As a class, NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy compared with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. The five-year relative survival rate from 2008 to 2014 for patients with NSCLC was approximately 19%.
 Patients with resectable disease may be cured by surgery or surgery followed by chemotherapy.  Local control can be achieved with radiation therapy in a large number of patients with unresectable disease, but a cure is seen only in a small number of patients.  Patients with locally advanced unresectable disease may achieve long term survival with radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy.  Patients with advanced metastatic disease may achieve improved survival and palliation of symptoms with chemotherapy, targeted agents, and other supportive measures.  The disease becomes resistant to therapy and returns in the majority of patients.

 Mesothelioma
 Mesothelioma is a form of cancer that is most often caused by asbestos and affects the smooth lining of the chest, lungs, heart, and abdomen.  Mesothelioma most often forms in the pleural cavity of the chest or into the abdomen as a solid tumor that begins as a result of insult to the tissues caused by asbestos particles, which penetrate into the pleural cavity of the chest.
 Pleural mesothelioma accounts for approximately 2,500 - 3,000 cases a year in the United States.  This disease affects the pleura, which is the thin balloon shaped lining of the lungs.  In its early stages, mesothelioma is difficult to detect as it may start with a thickening of the pleural rind, or fluid, which can be associated with many other conditions.  This rind is normally thin and smooth in the non-diseased state.  In time, it begins to demonstrate progression, forming a more pronounced irregular rind and nodules, which coalesce into a crust that compresses and invades into adjacent structures compromising lung and cardiac function.
 The symptoms of mesothelioma gradually become more noticeable, prompting the patient to seek a medical consultation.  By this time, the progression of the disease may already be too advanced, as the tumor may have spread to the lymph nodes and/or begun to metastasize to remote organs of the body like the brain, spleen, liver or kidneys.
 OUR STRATEGY
 COPIKTRA and defactinib seek to utilize a multi-faceted approach to treat cancer by directly targeting the cancer cells, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, and modulating the local tumor microenvironment.  Our goal is to build a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel drugs that use a multi-faceted approach to improving outcomes for patients with cancer. 
 Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

· | Continuing to support and maintain a commercial infrastructure in the United States for the marketing of COPIKTRA in approved and indicated hematologic malignancies as an oral monotherapy for patients needing additional lines of therapy following previous treatment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding the indications in which COPIKTRA and defactinib may be used. In parallel with the CLL/SLL, iNHL, PTCL, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and mesothelioma trials and studies that we are currently conducting, we plan to pursue additional disease indications to expand the potential of our product and product candidate. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Advancing our product candidates through clinical development. We have ongoing clinical trials and studies of duvelisib and defactinib both as single agents and in combination with other agents in several hematologic and solid tumor indications.

· | Collaborating selectively to augment and accelerate translational research, development and commercialization. We may seek third‑party collaborators for the development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. In particular, we may enter into third‑party arrangements for target oncology indications in which our potential collaborator has particular expertise or for which we need access to additional research, development, or commercialization resources. Additionally, we may seek third-party collaborations outside of the United States to continue to maximize the benefits of our product and product candidate to patients around the world. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Considering the acquisition or in‑licensing of rights to additional agents. We may pursue the acquisition or in‑license of rights to additional agents from third parties that may supplement our internal programs and allow us to initiate clinical development of a diverse pipeline of agents more quickly. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Building and maintaining scientific leadership in the areas of lymphoid malignancies, immuno-oncology, and the tumor microenvironment. We plan to continue to conduct research in the hematological and immuno-oncology fields to further our understanding of the underlying biology of enhancing the body’s immune response to tumors as well as cancer progression and metastasis. We also plan to continue fostering relationships with top scientific advisors, researchers and physicians. We believe that exceptional advisors, employees and management are critical to the development of new therapies for the treatment of cancer.

  OUR PRODUCT AND PRODUCT CANDIDATE
 Our pipeline product and product candidate currently consist of COPIKTRA, which is now commercially available in the United States, having been approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies in September 2018, and defactinib, which continues to be evaluated in the clinic for the treatment of a variety of cancer types.
     COPIKTRA (duvelisib)
 Our lead product, COPIKTRA (duvelisib), is the first approved oral, dual inhibitor of PI3K-delta and PI3K-gamma.  COPIKTRA received approval from the FDA on September 24, 2018 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) after at least two prior therapies and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), after at least two prior systemic therapies. The indication in FL is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefits in confirmatory trials. 
 The FDA approved labeling for COPIKTRA includes a boxed warning for four fatal and/or serious toxicities: infections, diarrhea or colitis, cutaneous reactions, and pneumonitis. Additionally, we have implemented an informational Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), as requested by the FDA, to support physicians in managing dosing and adverse reactions in their patients on COPIKTRA. In addition to the boxed warning, use of COPIKTRA is also associated with adverse reactions, which may require dose reduction, treatment delay or discontinuation of COPIKTRA. Warnings and precautions are provided in the package insert for infections, diarrhea or colitis, cutaneous reactions, pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, neutropenia, and embryo-fetal toxicity. The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients) were diarrhea or colitis, neutropenia, rash, fatigue, pyrexia, cough, nausea, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia.
 The approval of COPIKTRA by the FDA was based on results obtained from two FDA clinical studies – DUO™ and DYNAMO™.  The DUO study is a Phase 3, monotherapy, open-label, two-arm, randomized, superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of duvelisib at 25 mg BID compared to ofatumumab, a monoclonal antibody treatment, administered to patients who have been diagnosed with CLL/SLL and whose disease is relapsed or refractory.  A total of 319 patients were included in the study, of which 160 patients were treated with COPIKTRA and 159 patients were treated with ofatumumab.  Patients in DUO that continue to derive benefit remain on treatment.  DUO enrollment criteria included patients with CLL/SLL, whose disease had progressed during or relapsed after at least one previous CLL/SLL therapy.  The primary endpoint of the study was

Progression-Free Survival (PFS).  The FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted orphan drug designation to duvelisib for the treatment of CLL/SLL.
 The DYNAMO study is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm monotherapy study evaluating the safety and efficacy of duvelisib dosed at 25 mg BID in 129 patients with iNHL.  Patients in DYNAMO that continue to derive a benefit remain on treatment.  DYNAMO enrollment criteria included patients with FL, the most common subtype of iNHL, MZL and SLL, whose disease is double-refractory to rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy and who must have progressed within six months of receiving their final dose of a previous therapy.  The primary endpoint of the study was an overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) and according to the revised International Working Group (IWG) Criteria, which includes a change in target nodal lesions in combination with other measurements to determine response to treatment.  The FDA and EMA granted orphan drug designation to duvelisib for the treatment of FL.
 THE COPIKTRA LABEL
 The CLL/SLL indication for COPIKTRA is based on data from a subset of patients in the DUO trial who had received two or more prior lines of therapy. These 196 patients were the majority of patients enrolled in DUO.    The sub-analysis data included in the COPIKTRA label resulted in a median PFS by central review in this population of 16.4 months for COPIKTRA vs. 9.1 months for ofatumumab with a Standard Error of 2.1 and 0.5 months, respectively. This equates to a hazard ratio of 0.4, with a Standard Error of 0.2; or a 60% reduction in the risk of progression or death.  Additionally, COPIKTRA achieved a 78% ORR, compared to 39% for ofatumumab – a 39% difference, with a Standard Error of 6.4%.

     The primary data in support of the accelerated approval in FL by the FDA in the United States was derived from updated results for the subset of follicular lymphoma patients in the DYNAMO study.  This subset of data was comprised of a pre-treated double refractory patient population with a median of 3 prior lines of therapy.  In this patient population, treatment with COPIKTRA resulted in a 42% overall response rate, with a 95% confidence interval between 31% and 54%, and a maximum duration of response up to nearly 3 and a half years as of the last data cut-off.  Based on this data, and an unmet need for additional therapy options in FL, COPIKTRA is now indicated for the treatment of U.S. patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after at least two prior systemic therapies.

 THE DUO AND DYNAMO STUDIES
 As discussed above, COPIKTRA’s indicated label for the treatment of CLL/SLL and FL patients was derived from subsets of the complete datasets from DUO and DYNAMO, respectively.  Those complete results have subsequently been published in the public domain, as discussed below. THE DUO STUDY
 The results from the DUO study were presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Hematology conference (ASH 2017) and published in the journal Blood in December 2018 (volume 132).  The DUO study met its primary endpoint with oral duvelisib monotherapy achieving a statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to ofatumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL per a blinded IRC using modified international workshop on CLL (iwCLL) or revised IWG Response Criteria (median PFS=13.3 months versus 9.9 months, respectively; HR=0.52, p<0.0001), representing a 48% reduction in the risk of progression or death.
 Median PFS per IRC

 *Flinn et al., ASH 2017
 Similar efficacy results for duvelisib were observed regardless of whether patients had 17p deletion (del[17p]).  The primary outcome of median PFS via IRC review in the del[17p] subpopulation significantly favored duvelisib over ofatumumab (median PFS=12.7 months versus 9.0 months, respectively; HR=0.41, p=0.0011), representing a 59% reduction in the risk of progression or death.  Per investigator assessment, duvelisib demonstrated a median PFS of 17.6 months, compared to 9.7 months for ofatumumab (HR=0.40, p<0.0001).  Duvelisib maintained a PFS advantage in all patient subgroups analyzed as a subset of pre-specified sensitivity analyses.

 Patients who progressed in the DUO study were given the option to enroll in a crossover study to receive the opposite treatment.  In the optional crossover study, 89 patients who were previously treated with ofatumumab in DUO and experienced confirmed disease progression were subsequently treated with duvelisib as a monotherapy. As in the parent DUO study, duvelisib demonstrated robust clinical activity in this crossover study with an ORR of 73%, a median DOR of 12.7 months and a median PFS of 15 months, by investigator assessments. 
 Following prolonged exposure in DUO, duvelisib monotherapy demonstrated a manageable safety profile, with results from this study consistent with the well-characterized safety profile of duvelisib monotherapy in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies in previous studies.  For duvelisib-treated patients, the median time on treatment was 50.3 weeks (range, 0.9 - 160.0) compared to 23.1 weeks (range, 0.1 - 26.1) for ofatumumab.  The most common Grade ≥3 treatment-emergent hematologic adverse events (occurring in more than 10% of patients) were neutropenia (30%) and anemia (13%).  The most common Grade ≥3 non-hematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (occurring in more than 10% of patients) were diarrhea (15%), pneumonia (14%) and colitis (12%).  The rate of severe opportunistic infections was 6%, including two patients (1%) with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), neither of whom was on prophylaxis for PJP at the time of the event.  Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 35% of patients.  Approximately 40% of patients treated with duvelisib remained on treatment for over 18 months, with a median total follow-up of nearly two years. 
 Adverse events of special interest infrequently led to discontinuation of duvelisib treatment (e.g., diarrhea (5%), colitis (5%), pneumonitis (2%), neutropenia (1%), pneumonia (1%), transaminase elevations (1%), and rash (1%).  Duvelisib treatment-related adverse events leading to death (n=4) include general physical health deterioration (n=1), pneumonia staphylococcal (n=2) and sepsis (n=1)).

 THE DYNAMO STUDY
 Similarly, results from the DYNAMO study were presented at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Hematology conference (ASH 2016).  DYNAMO achieved the primary endpoint in a heavily pre-treated, double-refractory patient population with an ORR of 46% (p=0.0001) in the ITT population, as assessed by an IRC with a median DOR of 10 months. The breakdown of ORR in the three subtypes of iNHL for the overall study population was 41% in FL (n=83), 68% in SLL (n=28) and 33% in MZL (n=18). Eighty-three percent of patients had a reduction of target nodal lesions in lymph nodes.

     Duvelisib demonstrated a consistent and manageable safety profile with appropriate risk mitigation in the DYNAMO study. The majority of adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, reversible and/or clinically manageable. The most common (greater than 5%) Grade 3 adverse effects were an increase in diarrhea (14%), anemia (10%), and neutropenia (9%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of special interest included neutropenia (28%), infection (18%), diarrhea (15%), thrombocytopenia (13%), anemia (12%), pneumonia (9%), hepatotoxicity (8%), rash (7%), colitis (5%), and pneumonitis (2%). Serious opportunistic infections were less than 5% with none being fatal. Four treatment-related adverse events had the outcome of death (one septic shock; one viral infection; one drug reaction/eosinophilia/systemic symptoms; and one toxic epidermal necrolysis/sepsis syndrome).

 Based largely on the clinical results of the DUO and DYNAMO studies, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) added COPIKTRA to the Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines), the standard physician resource for determining the appropriate course of treatment for patients, for CLL/SLL, FL and MZL. We believe these updated guidelines will increase awareness for COPIKTRA and help health care providers make informed decisions for patients battling these difficult to treat advanced cancers.
 In addition, duvelisib is being evaluated as an investigational compound in clinical trials, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer agents, in hematologic or solid tumor malignancies. The safety and efficacy of these investigational uses of duvelisib have not yet been evaluated by the FDA or any other health authority for marketing authorization.
 T-cell Lymphoma, Aggressive NHL and Other Lymphomas
     In a Phase 1 study published in Blood in February 2018, the ORR in patients with PTCL treated with duvelisib monotherapy (n=16) was 50%, including three complete responses (CRs) and five partial responses (PRs).  Responses were seen across the spectrum of PTCL subtypes, including CRs and PRs in patients with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), AITL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL), and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), among others.  DOR in the PTCL population ranged from 1.8 to 17.3 months with median PFS of 8.3 months and median overall survival of 8.4 months.  In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) (n=19), the ORR was 32%, with six PRs.  DOR ranged from 0.7 to 10.1 months and median PFS was 4.5 months.  Median overall survival was not reached; however, the estimated probability of survival was determined to be 90% at 6 months, 79% at 12 and 18 months, and 73% at 24 months.  Duvelisib monotherapy demonstrated a manageable safety profile, with results from this study consistent with the well-characterized safety profile of duvelisib monotherapy in patients with hematologic malignancies in other studies.  These clinical results were supported by preclinical findings showing that duvelisib exhibited cell-killing activity in vivo and promoted beneficial changes within the tumor microenvironment. 
 During 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with PTCL, who have received at least one prior therapy. During the first quarter of 2018, we initiated an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 clinical trial (PRIMO) evaluating the efficacy and safety of duvelisib in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL.  This study is currently being conducted in the United States and we expect to expand the study to the European Union, Japan and potentially other territories.
 DEFACTINIB
 Defactinib is an orally available small molecule kinase inhibitor designed to inhibit FAK signaling. We are currently evaluating defactinib as a potential therapy for ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma, NSCLC, and other solid tumors. Defactinib has orphan drug designation in ovarian cancer in the United States and the European Union and in mesothelioma in the United States, the European Union, and Australia.
 The effects of FAK inhibition on the tumor microenvironment make defactinib a good candidate for combination therapy with immuno-oncology agents and other anti-cancer compounds.  FAK expression is greater in many tumor types compared to normal tissue, particularly in cancers that have a high invasive and metastatic capability.  The contact between cancer cells and connective tissue stimulates FAK signaling. 
 The clinical evaluation of defactinib is supported by a growing body of preclinical research suggesting that FAK inhibition, when combined with PD-1 inhibitors, increases the anti-tumor activity of these immunotherapeutic agents.  As published in the journals Cell and Nature Medicine, FAK inhibition has been shown to increase cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells in tumors, decrease T-cell exhaustion, decrease immunosuppressive cell populations, enhance T-cell killing of tumor cells, and create a generally more favorable tumor microenvironment, which may allow for enhanced efficacy of immuno-oncology therapeutics.
 Pancreatic cancer, along with other tumors such as ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, are tumor types in which immunotherapeutics have achieved limited clinical benefit, possibly due to the dense desmoplastic stroma and the abundance of immunosuppressive cells.  Preclinical research has demonstrated that high stromal density prevents 

 
  19

 
anti-cancer agents and T-cells from entering pancreatic tumors thereby limiting efficacy.  In preclinical research conducted by us and others, FAK inhibition was shown to reduce stromal density and allow cytotoxic T-cells to better penetrate the tumor and kill the cancer cells.  Collectively, these data provide strong rationale for combining our FAK inhibitors with checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic for pancreatic and other solid tumors.
 Phase 1/2 study with Cancer Research United Kingdom (CRUK) in combination with pembrolizumab.    In September 2016, we announced a new clinical collaboration with CRUK and Merck & Co. to evaluate defactinib in combination with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with NSCLC, mesothelioma, or pancreatic cancer.
 Phase 1/1b study in combination with immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer.    Defactinib is in a dose escalation study in combination with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab and gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.  This Phase 1 clinical trial is anticipated to enroll approximately 50 patients and is being conducted at the Washington University School of Medicine’s Division of Oncology under the direction of Andrea Wang-Gillam, M.D., Ph.D., Clinical Director of the Gastrointestinal Oncology Program.  This trial is primarily designed to evaluate the safety of the combination regimen and may also provide a greater understanding of how FAK inhibition in combination with immunotherapies could improve outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.  We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of treatment and patient selection created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates.  Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know‑how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.  We also rely on know‑how, continuing technological innovation and in‑licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.  We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions.  In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance.  Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims.  We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications.  Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention.

 Patents
 Our patent portfolio includes issued and pending applications worldwide.  These patent applications fall into three categories: (1) PI3K inhibition program; (2) FAK inhibition program; and (3) other programs.
 PI3K inhibition program

As previously discussed, we are currently marketing and continuing to develop the PI3K inhibitor COPIKTRA (duvelisib).

We have exclusively licensed a portfolio of patent applications owned by Intellikine LLC and Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Infinity), which are directed to PI3K inhibitor compounds and methods of their use, for example, in cancer.  Certain patent families are related to duvelisib.  These patent families include issued patents having claims covering duvelisib generically and specifically.  Also included are issued patents covering certain polymorphs of duvelisib.  Exemplary patents covering duvelisib, pharmaceutical compositions comprising duvelisib, methods of use, polymorphs, and methods of manufacture include US 8,193,182; US 8,785,456, and US 9,216,982.  These U.S. patents have issued and will expire between 2029 and 2032.  We have applied for patent term extension for US 8,193,182, which, if granted, will extend the term of the portion covering duvelisib to 2033.  Related issued and pending worldwide patents and applications with claims to duvelisib, pharmaceutical compounds, methods of use, polymorphs, and methods of manufacture are pending in about 40 countries.  Additional patent applications related to certain methods of use and combination therapies, as issued, would expire between 2029 and 2036.
 FAK inhibition program
 We are also currently developing the FAK inhibitor defactinib.
 We have exclusively licensed a portfolio of patent applications owned by Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer), which are directed to FAK inhibitor compounds and methods of their use, for example in cancer.  One patent family is related generally to defactinib.  This patent family includes issued patents having claims covering defactinib generically and specifically.  For example, US 7,928,109 covers the composition of matter of defactinib specifically and US 8,247,411 covers the composition of matter of defactinib generically.  Also included are issued and pending patent applications having claims directed to methods of treatment and methods of making defactinib.  For example, US 8,440,822 covers methods of making defactinib.  Any U.S. patents that have issued or will issue in this family will have a statutory expiration date in April of 2028.  Related cases are pending worldwide, including for example in Europe, Brazil, Thailand, Hong Kong, and India, and granted in Australia, Mexico, Canada, China, Korea, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan.
 In addition to the issued and pending patent applications exclusively licensed from Pfizer, we own three patent families covering defactinib.  One family is directed to compositions (e.g., oral dosage forms) of defactinib and certain methods of use.  Any U.S. patents that will issue in this family will have a statutory expiration date in January of 2035.  The other two families are directed to methods of using a FAK inhibitor in combination with another agent, such as defactinib in combination with a mitogen-activated protein kinase enzymes (MEK) inhibitor for treating a patient or defactinib in combination with an immunotherapeutic agent.  Any U.S. patents that will issue in these families will have a statutory expiration date in February of 2035 and June of 2036.
 Our licensed portfolio of patent applications from Pfizer also includes four families of patent applications directed to VS‑6062 and related methods of use.  The patent families include issued and pending patent applications having claims directed to VS‑6062, methods of manufacture, and pharmaceutical salts.  Patents have issued in these families in the U.S. that will expire in December of 2023, April of 2025, and November of 2028, respectively.  Related cases have been granted worldwide, including for example in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and Europe.
 Patent Term
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest‑filed non‑provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority.  The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term 

 
  21

 
adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier‑expiring patent.
 The term of a United States patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted.  With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch‑Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one United States patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA‑approved drug, an FDA‑approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA‑approved drug.  The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non‑extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug.  Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. As stated above, we have applied for patent term extension for US 8,193,182, which, if granted, will extend the term of the portion covering duvelisib to 2033. 
     LICENSES
 Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 In November 2016, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Infinity, under which we acquired an exclusive worldwide license for the research, development, commercialization, and manufacture of products in oncology indications containing duvelisib.  In connection with the license agreement, we assumed operational and financial responsibility for certain activities that were part of Infinity’s duvelisib program, including the DUO study for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL, and Infinity maintained a portion of the financial responsibility for the shutdown of certain other clinical studies. We are obligated to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize a product in an oncology indication containing duvelisib.  As previously discussed, COPIKTRA was approved by the FDA on September 24, 2018 and is now indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) after at least two prior therapies and relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after at least two prior systemic therapies. During the term of the license agreement, Infinity has agreed not to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize duvelisib in any other indication in humans or animals.
     Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we are required to make the following payments to Infinity in cash or, at our election, in whole or in part, in shares of our common stock: (i) $6.0 million upon the completion of the DUO study if the results of the study meet certain pre-specified criteria, which was paid in cash by us to Infinity in October 2017, and (ii) $22.0 million upon the approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) in the United States or an application for marketing authorization with a regulatory authority outside of the United States for a product in an oncology indication containing duvelisib, which was paid in cash by us to Infinity in November 2018.
     We are also obligated to pay Infinity royalties on worldwide net sales of any products in an oncology indication containing duvelisib ranging from the mid-single digits to the high single digits.  The royalties will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of (i) the last-to-expire patent right covering the applicable product in the applicable country, (ii) the last-to-expire patent right covering the manufacture of the applicable product in the country of manufacture of such product, (iii) the expiration of non-patent regulatory exclusivity in such country and (iv) ten years following the first commercial sale of a product in a country, provided that if royalties on net sales for a product in the United States are payable solely on the basis of non-patent regulatory exclusivity, the applicable royalty on net sales for such product in the United States will be reduced by 50%.  The royalties are also subject to reduction by 50% of certain third-party royalty payments or patent litigation damages or settlements which might be required to be paid by us if litigation were to arise, with any such reductions capped at 50% of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period.
     In addition to the foregoing, we are obligated to pay Infinity an additional royalty of 4% on worldwide net sales of any products in an oncology indication containing duvelisib to cover the reimbursement of research and development costs owed by Infinity to Mundipharma International Corporation Limited (MICL) and Purdue 

 
  22

 
Pharmaceutical Products L.P. (Purdue).  Once Infinity has fully reimbursed MICL and Purdue, the royalty obligations will be reduced to 1% of net sales in the United States.  These trailing MICL royalties are payable until the later to occur of the last-to-expire of specified patent rights and the expiration of non-patent regulatory exclusivities in a country.  Each of the above royalty rates is reduced by 50% on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis if the applicable royalty is payable solely on the basis of non-patent regulatory exclusivity.  In addition, the trailing MICL royalties are subject to reduction by 50% of certain third-party royalty payments or patent litigation damages or settlements which might be required to be paid by us if litigation were to arise, with any such reductions capped at 50% of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period.

 
  23

 

 Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.

On June 5, 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the Yakult Agreement) with Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd. (Yakult), under which we granted exclusive rights to Yakult to develop and commercialize products containing duvelisib in Japan for the treatment, prevention, palliation or diagnosis of all oncology indications in humans or animals.

Under the terms of the Yakult Agreement, Yakult received an exclusive right to develop and commercialize products containing duvelisib in Japan under mutually agreed development and commercialization plans at its own cost and expense.  Yakult also received certain limited manufacturing rights in the event that we are unable to manufacture or supply sufficient quantities of duvelisib or products containing duvelisib to Yakult during the term of the Yakult Agreement.  We retained all rights to duvelisib outside of Japan.

Yakult paid us an upfront, non-refundable payment of $10.0 million in June 2018.  We are also entitled to receive aggregate payments of up to $90.0 million if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are successfully achieved. Yakult is obligated to pay us a double-digit royalty on net sales of products containing duvelisib in Japan, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, and to fund certain global development costs related to worldwide clinical trials conducted by us in which Yakult has opted to participate (Global Clinical Trials) on a pro-rata basis.

Unless earlier terminated by either party, the Yakult Agreement will expire upon the fulfillment of Yakult’s royalty obligations to us for the sale of any products containing duvelisib in Japan, which royalty obligations expire, on a product-by-product basis, upon the last to occur of (a) expiration of valid claims covering such product, (b) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product or (c) 10 years from first commercial sale of such product. Yakult may terminate the Yakult Agreement in its entirety at any time with 180 days’ written notice.  Either party may terminate the Yakult Agreement in its entirety with 60 days’ written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach.  We may terminate the Yakult Agreement if (i) Yakult fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products containing duvelisib in Japan or (ii) Yakult challenges any patent licensed by us to Yakult under the Yakult Agreement.  Either party may terminate the Yakult Agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party.
 CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited (CSPC)

On September 25, 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with CSPC (the CSPC Agreement), under which we granted exclusive rights to CSPC to develop and commercialize products containing duvelisib in the People’s Republic of China (China), Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, the CSPC Territory) for the treatment, prevention, palliation or diagnosis of all oncology indications in humans.

Under the terms of the CSPC Agreement, CSPC received an exclusive right to develop and commercialize products containing duvelisib in the CSPC Territory under mutually agreed upon development and commercialization plans at its own cost and expense.  CSPC also received certain limited manufacturing rights in the event that we are unable to manufacture or supply sufficient quantities of duvelisib or products containing duvelisib to CSPC during the term of the CSPC Agreement.  We retained all rights to duvelisib outside of the CSPC Territory.

CSPC paid us an aggregate upfront, non-refundable payment of $15.0 million, $5.0 million of which had already been paid by CSPC as a non-refundable exclusivity fee.  We are also entitled to receive aggregate payments of up to $160.0 million if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are successfully achieved.  CSPC is obligated to pay us a double-digit royalty on net sales of products containing duvelisib in the CSPC Territory, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, and to fund certain global development costs related to worldwide clinical trials conducted by us in which CSPC has opted to participate (Global Clinical Trials) on a pro-rata basis.

Unless earlier terminated by either party, the CSPC Agreement will expire upon the fulfillment of CSPC’s royalty obligations to us for the sale of any products containing duvelisib in the CSPC Territory, which royalty obligations expire, on a product-by-product basis, upon the last to occur of (a) expiration of valid claims covering such product, (b) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product or (c) 10 years from first commercial sale of such product.  CSPC may terminate the CSPC Agreement in its entirety at any time with 180 days’ written notice.  Either party may terminate the CSPC Agreement in its entirety with 60 days’ written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach.  We may terminate the CSPC Agreement if (i) CSPC fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products containing duvelisib in the CSPC Territory or (ii) CSPC challenges any patent licensed by us to CSPC under the CSPC Agreement.  Either party may terminate the CSPC Agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party.
 Pfizer Inc.
 On July 11, 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Pfizer under which Pfizer granted us worldwide, exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing certain of Pfizer’s inhibitors of FAK, including defactinib, for all therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic uses in humans.  We have the right to grant sublicenses under the foregoing licensed rights, subject to certain restrictions.  We are solely responsible, at our own expense, for the clinical development of these products, which is to be conducted in accordance with an agreed‑upon development plan.  We are also responsible for all manufacturing and commercialization activities at our own expense.  Pfizer provided us with an initial quantity of clinical supplies of one of the products for an agreed upon price.
 Upon entering into the license agreement, we made a one‑time cash payment to Pfizer in the amount of $1.5 million and issued 192,012 shares of our common stock.  Pfizer is also eligible to receive up to $2.0 million in developmental milestones and up to an additional $125.0 million based on the successful attainment of regulatory and commercial sales milestones. Pfizer is also eligible to receive high single to mid-double-digit royalties on future net sales of the products.  Our royalty obligations with respect to each product in each country begin on the date of first commercial sale of the product in that country, and end on the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of the product in that country or the date of expiration or abandonment of the last claim contained in any issued patent or patent application licensed by Pfizer to us that covers the product in that country.
 The license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all our royalty obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis.  So long as we are not in breach of the license agreement, we have the right to terminate the license agreement at will on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis, or in its entirety, upon 90 days written notice to Pfizer.  Either party has the right to terminate the license agreement in connection with an insolvency event involving the other party or a material breach of the license agreement by the other party that remains uncured for a specified period of time.  If the license agreement is terminated by either party for any reason, worldwide rights to the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of the products revert back to Pfizer.
 COMPETITION
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products.  While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.  Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do.  Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.  These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in 

 
  25

 
acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.  Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.  Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.  In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third‑party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.  There are many generic products currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years.  If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted drug therapy.  There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy.  While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates will not be competitive with them.  Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis.  Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third‑party payors.  In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none of them are successful in treating all patients.  As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat cancer.  These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies.  As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.
 Our competitors may commence and complete clinical testing of their product candidates, obtain regulatory approvals and begin commercialization of their products sooner than we may for our own product candidates.  These competitive products may have superior safety or efficacy, or be manufactured less expensively, than our product candidates.  If we are unable to compete effectively against these companies on the basis of safety, efficacy or cost, then we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates or achieve a competitive position in the market.  This would adversely affect our business.

 MANUFACTURING
 We contract with third parties for the manufacture of COPIKTRA for commercial and clinical use and for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. We currently work with one contract manufacturing organization (CMO) for the production of duvelisib drug substance, one CMO for the production of oral drug product, and one CMO for the final commercial and clinical packaging.  We have long-term supply agreements in place with each of these CMOs.  We are currently evaluating a second source supplier program for the manufacture and packaging of duvelisib.  For defactinib, we have one CMO for the manufacture of drug product, one CMO for the production of drug substance, and one CMO for drug packaging. We obtain drug product or substance from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis.  We may elect to pursue relationships with other CMOs for manufacturing clinical supplies for later-stage clinical trials and for commercialization.  We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We have personnel with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience who are responsible for the relationships with our CMOs.
 All of our drug candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules.  We select compounds not only on the basis of their potential efficacy and safety, but also for their ease of synthesis and the reasonable cost of their starting materials.  We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost‑effectively at third‑party manufacturing facilities.
 COMMERCIAL STRATEGY

We intend to develop and commercialize our drugs in the U.S., Canada and the European Union alone or with partners, and expect to rely on partners to develop and commercialize our drugs in other territories throughout the world. On September 24, 2018, our first commercial product, COPIKTRA, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with hematologic cancers including CLL/SLL and FL. We sell COPIKTRA to a limited number of specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors in the United States.  These customers subsequently resell COPIKTRA either directly to patients, or to community hospitals or oncology clinics with in-office dispensaries who in turn distribute COPIKTRA to patients. In the U.S., our sales team promotes our commercial product for its approved indications through direct field contact with physicians, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers.  

None of our product candidates have received regulatory approval for commercial sale in territories outside of the United States.  As set forth above, we have entered into agreements with third-party partners for the development and commercialization of duvelisib in territories outside of the United States and have agreed to manufacture or supply quantities of our product candidate in conjunction with these efforts.  We continue to evaluate opportunities and potential partnerships to develop and commercialize duvelisib in territories outside the United States.  In executing these arrangements, our goal is to retain significant worldwide oversight over the development process and commercialization of our products by playing an active role in their commercialization or finding partners who share our vision, values, culture and processes. 
 APPLICABLE LAWS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
 United States drug approval process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.  Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or 

 
  28

 
judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (IND) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

  Preclinical studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use.  The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations.  An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND.  Some long‑term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial.  Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.  A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.  In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for 

 
  29

 
any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review.  The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects.  An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.  Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur.  Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all.  Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.  Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently scheduled to exceed $2.4 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, based on the number of approved products. These fees are typically adjusted annually.  User fee statutory authority expires every five years.  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act was re-authorized for an additional five years in 2017 until 2022.  Fee waivers are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for an orphan drug application.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.  The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information.  The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review.  The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs.  Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non‑priority products within 10 months after accepting the application for filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months after accepting the application for filing.  The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission.  The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the 

 
  30

 
application should be approved.  The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.  The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.  In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete.  Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all.  We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
 After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter.  An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.  A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application.  If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.  The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.  Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product.  The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑market studies or surveillance programs.  After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast track designation
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition.  Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate.  The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete.  This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees.  However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted.  In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

 
  31

 

 Priority review
 Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review within a six‑month time frame from the time a complete application is accepted for filing.  Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease.
 Accelerated approval
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life‑threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives.  Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints.  A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of one or more Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis.  All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Orphan drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States.  Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA.  After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.  The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven‑year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication.  During the seven‑year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.  Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.  Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective.  The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.  Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation.
 The Hatch‑Waxman act
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product.  Upon approval of a drug, each of 

 
  32

 
the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.  Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).  Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug.  ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing.  Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.  Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

· | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


· | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification.  If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA.  The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification.  The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the NDA or patent holder’s receipt of the Paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity period, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, for the referenced product has expired.  Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval.  Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA for the conditions of use covered by the exclusivity, but FDA requires as a condition of approval new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor.  This three‑year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.  Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non‑patent marketing exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for a drug may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor conducts pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request.  For written requests issued by the FDA after September 27, 2007, the date of enactment of the FDAAA, the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity no later than nine months prior to the date of expiration of patent or non‑patent exclusivity in order for the six‑month pediatric extension to apply to that exclusivity period.

 Combination products
 The FDA regulates combinations of products that cross FDA centers, such as drug, biologic or medical device components that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined into a single entity, as a combination product.  The FDA center with primary jurisdiction for the combination product will take the lead in the premarket review of the product, with the other center consulting or collaborating with the lead center.
 The FDA’s Office of Combination Products (OCP) determines which center will have primary jurisdiction for the combination product based on the combination product’s “primary mode of action.”  A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action.  The primary mode of action is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.
 Often it is difficult for the OCP to determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of the combination product.  In those difficult cases, the OCP will consider consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions, or which center has the most expertise to evaluate the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product.
 A sponsor may use a voluntary formal process, known as a Request for Designation, when the product classification is unclear or in dispute, to obtain a binding decision as to which center will regulate the combination product. If the sponsor objects to that decision, it may request that the agency reconsider that decision.
 Other regulatory requirements
 Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.  After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
 The FDA may impose a number of post‑approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA.  For example, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.  Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements.  Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third‑party manufacturers that we may decide to use.  Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.  Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program.  Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  34

 


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.  The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Additional provisions
 Anti‑kickback and false claims laws

We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, for activities related to sales of any of our products.  Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a pharmaceutical manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase, prescription or use of a particular drug.  Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices.  There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such anti-kickback laws.  False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent.  
 Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products.  The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers and/or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions.  Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.  Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, any future activities could be subject to challenge.

If our operations are found to be in violation of the fraud and abuse laws described above, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Physician drug samples
 As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians.  The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping.  In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.
 Foreign regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, 

 
  35

 
clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products.  Regardless of our current FDA approval or any future FDA approvals we may obtain for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.  The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods.  The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval.  Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new drug products.  Sales of COPIKTRA or any other product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third‑party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations.  The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved.  Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals.  We may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective.  A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.  Third‑party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Within the United States, FDA-approved drugs could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by government agencies.  The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation.  The marketability of any of our approved products may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. 
 Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries.  Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs.  The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. 
 Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities.  Oral drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D.  Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician).  Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time.  The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts.  Since 2011, manufacturers with marketed brand name drugs have been required to provide a 50% discount the negotiated price for on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits, and, beginning in 2019, that discount increased to 70%.
 Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS).  FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (PHS) pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs.  FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product.

In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. 
 To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program.  Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort.  Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy.  If these third‑party payors do not consider our products to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.  The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government‑paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.  Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
 Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country.  Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed.  Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies.  For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.  European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market.  Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits.  The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense.  As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country.  There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 The marketability of COPIKTRA or any other products for which we have or will receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third‑party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.  In addition, there is an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing.  Coverage policies, third‑party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time.  Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for a product, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 New legislation and regulations

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the United States Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products.  For example, in December 2016, Congress enacted and President Obama signed into law the 21st Century Cures Act, that amends a number of sections of the FDCA.  In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.  It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.

In the United States, federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare.  For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs as well as the imposition of annual fees on manufacturers of branded pharmaceuticals.  Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminates the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019.  In a May 2018 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that, compared to 2018, the number of uninsured will increase by 3 million in 2019 and 6 million in 2028, in part due to the elimination of the individual mandate.
  The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge.  In December 2018, a federal district court, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because, once Congress repealed the individual mandate provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational in all respects.
 There have also been efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate drug pricing or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation.  Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals.  There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Specifically, at the federal level, for example, in May 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs.  Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry.  In October 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, solicited public comments on potential changes to payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs, including reducing the Medicare payment amount for selected Medicare Part B drugs to more closely align with international drug prices.  As another example, in November of 2018, CMS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that proposed revisions to Medicare Part D to support health plans’ negotiation of lower drug prices with manufacturers and reduce health plan members’ out-of-pocket costs. The HHS Office of Inspector General also issued a proposed rule in February of 2019 that would revise the federal anti-kickback statute to limit protection for discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”), Medicare Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care plans that are not reflected in the price charged to the patient at the pharmacy counter and to provide protection only for certain types of service fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs.
 Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Health Care Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
