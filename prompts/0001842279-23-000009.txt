ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OPAL Fuels Inc. (including its subsidiaries, the "Company", “OPAL,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a renewable energy company specializing in the capture and conversion of biogas for the production of RNG for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets, generation of Renewable Power for sale to utilities, generation and sale of Environmental Attributes associated with RNG and Renewable Power, and sales of RNG as pipeline quality natural gas. We are an established biogas-to-energy producer in the United States, having participated in the landfill gas to energy industry for over 20 years. We have established our operating portfolio through self-development, partnerships, and acquisitions.
Biogas is generated by microbes as they break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, and comprised of non-fossil waste gas, with high concentrations of methane, which is the primary component of RNG and the source for combustion utilized by Renewable Power plants to generate Renewable Power. Biogas can not only be collected and processed to remove impurities for use as RNG (a form of high-Btu fuel) and injected into existing natural gas pipelines as it is fully interchangeable with fossil natural gas, but partially treated biogas can be used directly in heating applications (as a form of medium-Btu fuel) or in the production of Renewable Power. Our principal sources of biogas are landfill gas, which is produced by the decomposition of organic waste at landfills and dairy manure, which is processed through anaerobic digesters to produce the biogas.
We also design, develop, construct, operate and service Fueling Stations for trucking fleets across the country that use natural gas to displace diesel as their transportation fuel. We have participated in the alternative vehicle fuels industry for approximately 12 years and have established an expanding network of Fueling Stations for dispensing RNG. In addition, we have recently begun implementing design, development, and construction services for hydrogen fueling stations, and we are pursuing opportunities to diversify its sources of biogas to other waste streams.
Business combination 
 On December 2, 2021, the Company (formerly known as ArcLight Clean Transition Corp. II, "Arclight"), OPAL HoldCo LLC ("OPAL Holdco") and OPAL Fuels LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("OPAL Fuels" or "Opco"), entered into a business combination agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”). On July 21, 2022, we closed the Business Combination Agreement and consummated the transactions contemplated thereby (the “Business Combination”). 
 Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on July 21, 2022, (the "Closing Date"), Arclight changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by deregistering as a Cayman Islands exempted company and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Domestication"). Following the Domestication, on July 21, 2022, Arclight changed its name to "OPAL Fuels Inc." and each outstanding ArcLight Class B ordinary share converted into one ArcLight Class A ordinary share, each outstanding ArcLight Class A ordinary share became one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A common stock”), and each outstanding warrant to purchase one ArcLight Class A ordinary share became a warrant to purchase one share of the Company's Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Following the consummation of the Business Combination on July 21, 2022, the Company was organized in an “Up-C” structure. The Company is the managing member of OPAL Fuels. OPAL Fuels directly or indirectly holds substantially all of the consolidated assets and business of the Company. Please see Note 3. Business Combination, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Recent Developments
Warrant exchange
On November 18, 2022, the Company announced the commencement of an exchange offer (the “Offer”) and consent solicitation relating to its outstanding (i) public warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share which warrants trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “OPALW”(the “Public Warrants”), and (ii) private placement warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock (the “Private Placement Warrants”) and together with the public warrants, the (“Warrants”). The Company offered all holders of the Warrants the opportunity to receive 0.250 shares of Class A common stock in exchange for each outstanding Warrant tendered by the holder and exchanged pursuant to the Offer. Concurrently with the Offer, the Company solicited 
consents from holders of the Warrants to amend the warrant agreement that governs all of the warrants (the “Warrant Agreement”) to permit the Company to require that each warrant that is outstanding upon the closing of the Offer be exchanged for 0.225 shares of Class A common stock, which is a ratio 10% less than the exchange ratio applicable to the Offer (the “Warrant Amendment”). 
On December 22, 2022, the Company completed the exchange offer and issued 3,309,296 shares of Class A common stock in exchange for the warrants tendered in the Offer. Pursuant to the Warrant Amendment dated December 21, 2022, the Company exercised its right to exchange the Warrants remaining outstanding at the closing of the Offer for 0.225 shares of Class A common stock per Warrant (the “Post-Offer Exchange”) and issued 497,080 shares of Class A common stock on December 23, 2022. Following the completion of the Offer and the Post-Offer Exchange the Public Warrants were suspended from trading on the Nasdaq and delisted. There are no longer any Warrants outstanding.
UPS Agreement
On December 15, 2022, the Company entered into a long-term agreement with UPS (the "UPS Agreement") pursuant to which the Company will provide operations and maintenance services to 51 UPS renewable natural gas dispensing stations across the United States. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive an amount based on an agreed price per gas gallon equivalent dispensed at each station.
Senior Secured Credit Facility 
On December 19, 2022, Fortistar Methane 3 LLC (“FM3”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, and the borrower under the senior secured credit facility (the "Senior Secured Credit Facility"), dated as of September 21, 2015, provided by a lender group led by MUFG Union Bank Ltd, as administrative agent, and guaranteed by certain direct subsidiaries of FM3, and Opal Fuels, a direct subsidiary of the Company, and the other parties to the Senior Secured Credit Facility entered into an Omnibus and Consent Agreement (the “FM3 Amendment”). The FM3 Amendment amended the Senior Secured Credit Facility, among other things, to (a) extend the maturity date of the obligations thereunder from December 20, 2022 to March 20, 2023, (b) permit Opal Fuels to purchase the rights and obligations of certain exiting lenders at par, (c) prepay a portion of the outstanding loans made by the remaining lenders and (d) permit the release of certain project company subsidiaries of FM3 from the collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, Opal Fuels holds approximately $45.0 million of the outstanding loans under the FM3 Credit Agreement as an affiliate lender. On March 20, 2023, the Company repaid in full the remaining outstanding balance under this loan facility. Please see Note.19 Subsequent Events for additional information. 
OPAL Term Loan II
 On August 4, 2022, OPAL Fuels Intermediate Holdco 2 LLC ("OPAL Intermediate Holdco 2"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a new senior secured credit facility (the "OPAL Term Loan II") with a syndicate of lenders. The indebtedness is guaranteed by certain of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of OPAL Intermediate Holdco 2. OPAL Term Loan II provides for an approximately two year delayed term loan facility (the "DDTL Facility") of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million and debt service reserve facility (the "DSR Facility") of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million. The proceeds of the DDTL Facility are to be used to fund a portion of the construction of the RNG projects owned, either in full or through a joint venture with a third party, by the subsidiary guarantors and the proceeds of the DSR Facility are to be used solely to satisfy the balance to be maintained in the debt service reserve account. In connection with the transaction, the Company paid $2.2 million as financing fees to the lenders and incurred $1.4 million of expenses.
Our Strategy
We aim to maintain and grow our position as a leading producer and dispenser of RNG in the United States and maintain and increase our position as a leading provider of RNG to the heavy and medium-duty commercial vehicle market in the U.S. We support these objectives through a multi-pronged strategy of:
•Promoting the reduction of methane and GHG emissions and expanding the use of renewable fuels to displace fossil-based fuels: We share the renewable fuel industry’s commitment to providing sustainable renewable energy solutions and offering products with high economic and ecological value. By simultaneously replacing fossil-based fuels and reducing overall methane emissions, our projects have a positive environmental impact. We are committed to the sustainable development, deployment, and utilization of RNG to reduce the country’s 
dependence on fossil fuels. We strive to optimize the economics of capturing biogas from our host landfills and dairy farms for conversion to RNG by balancing the capital and operating costs with the current and future quality and quantity of biogas.
•Expanding our industry position as a full-service partner for development opportunities, including through strategic transactions: Throughout our over 20 years of biogas conversion experience, we have developed the full range of biogas conversion project related capabilities from landfill gas collection system expertise, to engineering, construction, management and operations, through EHS oversight and Environmental Attributes management. Our full suite of capabilities allows us to serve as a multi-project partner, including through strategic transactions.
•Expanding our capabilities to new feedstock sources and technologies: We believe we will be able to enter new markets for our products, such as providing fuel for the production of renewable energy sources. With our experience and industry expertise, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities to meet the clean energy needs of other industries looking to use renewable energy in their operations. We are actively reviewing opportunities beyond our core LFG and dairy RNG business. Specifically, we intend to diversify our project portfolio beyond landfill biogas through the expansion into additional methane producing assets.
•Empowering our customers to achieve their sustainability and carbon reduction objectives: We are well positioned to empower our customers to achieve their sustainability and carbon reduction goals, including significantly reducing GHG emissions from their commercial transportation activities, at a cost to customers that is competitive to other fuels like diesel. We also assist our customers in their transition to cleaner transportation fuels by helping them obtain federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives, vehicle financing, and facilitating customer selection of vehicle specifications to meet their needs.
Vertical Integration of Business
The combination of Biogas Conversion Projects and Fueling Stations, together with the dispensing, generation, and monetization of the associated Environmental Attributes, differentiates us from our principal competitors. This vertical integration allows for a direct pathway to qualify biogas for Environmental Attributes and offers an attractive network of Fueling Stations to heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets running on natural gas.
Our involvement across the RNG value chain, from production to dispensing of RNG, gives us the opportunity to avoid value leakage that competitors may incur by having to rely upon third-parties for either RNG supply or dispensing. The additional value captured benefits us by allowing us to offer better terms to our increasing number of transportation customers. The increasing adoption of RNG as a fuel for transportation use amongst our customers subsequently gives us more opportunities to secure additional gas rights for Biogas Conversion Projects.
Our vertical integration also attracts low carbon intensity ("CI") project developers that need partners to market and dispense their fuel to obtain LCFS credits and provide the required economic returns on their projects. As a result, we gain opportunities to source new Biogas Conversion Projects as well as secure RNG marketing agreements from these developers. In addition, fleet owners are attracted to our biogas conversion and dispensing resources which results in the growth of dispensing, station construction and service businesses.
Management and Project Expertise
Our management team has decades of combined experience in the design, development, construction, maintenance, and operation of Biogas Conversion Projects and Fueling Stations that dispense RNG, as well as the monetization of the associated Environmental Attributes. We believe our team’s proven track record and focus give us a strategic advantage in continuing to grow our business. Our diverse experience and integration of key technical, environmental, and administrative support functions underpin our ability to design and operate projects and execute its day-to-day activities.
Our experience and existing project portfolio have provided access to a wide spectrum of available biogas-to-RNG and biogas-to-Renewable Power conversion technologies. We are technology agnostic and base project design on the available technologies (and related equipment) most suitable for the specific application, including membranes, media, and solvent-based gas cleanup technologies. We are actively engaged in the management of each project site and regularly serve in engineering, construction management, and commissioning roles. This allows us to develop a comprehensive 
understanding of the operational performance of each technology and how to optimize application of the technology to specific projects, including through enhancements and improvements of operating or abandoned projects. At LFG-to-RNG projects, technologies deployed at each project are relatively consistent and mature and management has extensive experience with such technologies. At livestock waste-to-RNG projects, digester technologies may be different from site to site but upgrading technology is generally consistent from site to site and they have both been widely used in the past several decades. Additionally, we also work with key vendors on initiatives to develop and test upgrades to existing technologies.
We also have a network of experienced and creditworthy EPC contractors to perform design, development, procurement and construction services under supervision by us. Typically, our contracts for EPC services contain fixed price, date certain provisions and liquidated damages provisions, which greatly reduce the risks typically associated with construction projects. We also work with key vendors on initiatives to develop and test upgrades to existing technologies.
Access to Development Opportunities
We have many relationships throughout the industry supply chain from technology and equipment providers to feedstock owners to RNG off-takers. We believe the strong reputation we have attained in combination with its understanding of the various and complex requirements for generating and monetizing Environmental Attributes gives us a competitive advantage relative to new market entrants. We further benefit from our vertical integration by offering dispensing and monetization services to third-party developers, which can lead to project acquisition or partnership opportunities for us.
We leverage our relationships built over the past several decades to identify and execute new project opportunities. Typically, new development opportunities come from our existing relationships with landfill owners and dairy developers who value our long operating history and strong reputation in the biogas conversion industry. This includes new projects or referrals from existing partners. We actively seek to extend the term of our contracts at project sites and views our positive relationships with the owners and managers of its host landfills and dairy farms as a contributing factor to our ability to extend contract terms as they come due.
Large and Diverse Project Portfolio
We believe we have one of the largest and most technologically optimized Biogas Conversion Project portfolios in the RNG industry. Our ability to solve unique project development challenges and integrate such solutions across our entire project portfolio has supported the long-term successful partnerships we have with its Biogas Conversion Project hosts. Because we are able to meet the varying needs of its host partners, we have a strong reputation and are actively sought out for new project and acquisition opportunities. Additionally, our size and financial discipline generally affords the ability to achieve priority service and pricing from contractors, service providers, and equipment suppliers.
EHS and Compliance
Our executive team places the highest priority on the health and safety of our staff and third parties at our project sites, as well as the preservation of the environment. Our corporate culture is built around supporting these priorities, as reflected in our well-established practices and policies. By setting and maintaining high standards in the renewable energy field, we are often able to contribute positively to the safety practices and policies of its host landfills, which reflects favorably on us with potential hosts when choosing a counterparty. Our high safety standards include use of wireless gas monitoring safety devices, active monitoring of all field workers, performance of regular EHS audits and the use of technology throughout our safety processes from employee training in compliance with operational processes and procedures to emergency preparedness. By extension, we incorporate our EHS standards into our subcontractor selection qualifications to ensure our commitment to high EHS standards is shared by our subcontractors which provides further assurances to our host landfills.
Nature of Business
Capture and Conversion Business
We typically secure our Biogas Conversion Projects through a combination of long-term gas rights, manure supply agreements, and property lease agreements with biogas site hosts. Our Biogas Conversion Projects provide our landfill and dairy farm partners with a variety of benefits, including (i) a means to monetize biogas from their sites, (ii) 
regulatory compliance for landfills, (iii) a source of environmentally beneficial waste management practices for dairy farms and (iv) a valuable revenue stream. Once we have negotiated gas rights or manure supply agreements, we then design, develop, build, own and operate facilities that convert the biogas into RNG or uses the processed biogas to produce Renewable Power. We sell the RNG produced by the Biogas Conversion Projects through RNG marketing and dispensing agreements and generate associated Environmental Attributes. These Environmental Attributes are then sold to obligated parties as defined under the RFS promulgated by the U.S. federal government and Low Carbon Fuel Standard Programs established by several states. We also sell Renewable Power to public utilities through long-term power purchase agreements.
We believe there are other sources of biogas in the United States, and internationally, that could be utilized for potential future Biogas Conversion Project opportunities. We expect to continue our growth by taking advantage of these opportunities while also continuing to capitalize on additional vertical integration opportunities. Our evaluation and execution of project opportunities will benefit from our ability to leverage our industry experience, relationships with customers and vendors, knowledge about transmission and distribution utility interconnections, and capabilities to design, develop, construct, operate, maintain and service Biogas Conversion Projects and Fueling Stations. We exercise financial discipline in pursuing these projects by targeting project returns that are in line with the relative risk of the specific projects.
Our current Biogas Conversion Projects generate RNG from landfill sites and dairy farms. We view the acquisition of new landfill gas, dairy farm, and other biogas waste projects as significant opportunities for us to expand our RNG business, complementing the ongoing conversion of certain of our existing Renewable Power plants to RNG production facilities. We believe our business is scalable, which is expected to continue to support growth through development and acquisitions.
We differentiate ourself from our competitors based on our vertically integrated business model and long history of working with leading vendors, technologies and utilities. Our competitive advantage is further strengthened by our expertise in designing, developing, constructing and operating Biogas Conversion Projects and Fueling Stations.
Dispensing and Monetization Business
We are a leading provider of RNG marketing and dispensing in the alternative vehicle fuels market for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States. In this sector, we focus on dispensing RNG through Fueling Stations that serve fleets that use natural gas instead of diesel fuel. These Fueling Stations and dispensing services are key for our business because Environmental Attributes are generated through dispensing RNG at these stations for use as vehicle fuel for transportation, and, once generated, the Environmental Attributes can then be monetized. During 2022, we dispensed 29.3 million gasoline gallon equivalent ("GGEs") of RNG to the transportation market, generating corresponding Environmental Attributes, utilizing our current network of 242 Fueling Stations in 40 states in the United States, including more than 35 stations in California.
Hydrogen Fuel
In the coming years, we believe we will be able to provide hydrogen fuel to vehicle fleets by constructing and servicing hydrogen fueling stations as well as providing RNG for hydrogen production. As fleet operators deploy more hydrogen powered vehicles, we anticipate constructing and servicing stations that use hydrogen derived from RNG to deliver low carbon hydrogen fuel to customers. We are currently in the design, engineering phase and construction of the first several of these hydrogen fueling stations.
How We Generate Revenue
Overview. Our revenues are driven principally from the sale of Environmental Attributes that are generated from dispensing RNG as transportation fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets at Fueling Stations. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of (i) Renewable Power, (ii) design, development, construction and service of Fueling Stations, and (iii) from sales of RNG produced by OPAL as pipeline quality natural gas.
Environmental Attributes. Currently, our Environmental Attributes revenue stream is primarily comprised of RINs, LCFS credits, and renewable energy credits ("RECs"). If RNG is dispensed into vehicles as transportation fuel, RINs will be generated under the RFS program. In certain states, there are LCFS programs, which allow a credit to be generated based on a fuel’s carbon intensity score. If RNG is used to produce hydrogen which is consumed in the transportation 
market in a state where an LCFS program is available, a LCFS credit may be generated as well. Lastly, LFG-to-Renewable Power projects can create Environmental Attributes, in the form of a REC, in certain states and can be bundled with electricity off-take or monetized separately. See "Biogas RNG Market Opportunity".
Power Purchase Agreements. Our Renewable Power projects generally have associated long-term Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) with creditworthy utility off-takers or municipalities. Nearly all of our Renewable Power off-takers have investment grade credit ratings with either S&P or Moody’s. As discussed above, we also generate RECs from Renewable Power projects through the conversion of biogas to Renewable Power.
Fueling Station Construction and Services. We have significant experience in the engineering, design, construction and operation of Fueling Stations that dispense RNG. Since 2009, TruStar Energy Holdings LLC ("OPAL Fuel Station Services"), one of our subsidiaries, together with its predecessors, has served as the general contractor or supervised qualified third-party contractors and completed over 350 Fueling Station projects. We use a combination of custom designed and off-the-shelf equipment to build these stations. We also perform in-house manufacturing and modularized portable CNG compressor packages for smaller dispensing stations, utilizing its patented technology that allows faster and easier station installations. These portable packages can include defueling panels that allow smaller fleet owners to avoid expensive maintenance shop upgrades. In addition, we also generate revenues by providing O&M services for customer stations; and by helping our customers obtain federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives.
Biogas Conversion Projects
Typically, a Biogas Conversion Project includes two phases: (i) biogas collection and (ii) processing and purifying biogas.
At landfills, biogas collection systems can be configured as vertical wells and horizontal collectors. The most common method is drilling vertical wells into the waste mass and connecting the wellheads to lateral piping that transports the gas to a collection header using a blower or vacuum induction system. Collection system operators “tune” or adjust the wellfield to maximize the volume and quality of biogas collected while maintaining environmental compliance. The existing compliance structure for landfills in the United States benefits us since the EPA requires larger landfills to have collection systems in place to collect and destroy biogas emissions. We turn this compliance cost into a revenue stream for the landfill and are able to leverage existing collection infrastructure in biogas plant design.
A basic biogas processing plant includes: (i) a moisture removal system, (ii) blowers to provide a vacuum to “pull” the gas and pressure to convey the gas and (iii) a flare for destroying unutilized gas. System operators monitor parameters to maximize system efficiency. Using biogas in a Renewable Power facility usually requires some treatment of the landfill gas to remove excess moisture, particulates, and other impurities. The type and extent of treatment depends on site-specific biogas characteristics and the type of Renewable Power facility. This partially cleaned biogas can be burned on-site to generate Renewable Power which can be immediately used or deployed into the grid. To further upgrade the gas to pipeline quality RNG, the partially treated biogas then goes through separation of the CO2 from the methane molecules. Further treatment of the biogas is often required to remove residual nitrogen and/or oxygen to meet pipeline specifications.
For dairy waste-to-RNG projects, manure is collected and then scraped or flushed into a reception pit or lagoon, and may be fed into a digester. The biogas equipment then anaerobically digests the manure and produces biogas. There are three different types of anaerobic digesters: (i) covered lagoons (existing lagoons that use large cover to capture methane); (ii) complete mix (large tanks that heat and mix manure), and (iii) plug-flow (long rectangular tanks; unmixed). The biogas is then upgraded to meet pipeline quality specifications.
If a biogas capture and conversion project is not within close proximity to a pipeline, the RNG is transported by road using tube trailers to a gas injection point. This is referred to as a virtual pipeline. 
Biogas RNG Market Opportunity
Biogas can be collected and processed to remove impurities for use as RNG (a form of high-Btu fuel) and injected into existing natural gas pipelines as it is fully interchangeable with fossil natural gas. Partially treated biogas can be used directly in heating applications (as a form of medium-Btu fuel) or in the production of Renewable Power. OPAL’s current primary sources of biogas are landfills and dairy farms.

Landfill- and livestock-sourced biogas serve as the base to produce RNG, while also reducing GHG emissions. While landfill projects for RNG and Renewable Power have been developed over the past few decades, undeveloped landfills remain a significant source of biogas. Moreover, as technology continues to develop and economic incentives grow, we believe additional sources of biogas will become available for RNG production.
Overview of Landfill Gas Sources
LFG, or landfill gas, is created through the naturally occurring anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Large landfills have been required by the EPA to capture municipal solid waste landfill emissions for decades due to various regulatory requirements aimed at reducing GHG emissions. The amount of LFG produced from a landfill generally increases as more waste is added to the site. Once a permitted landfill site is completely filled, the landfill will place a cap over the waste. Gas production then follows a generally predictable and modest decline over the next 30 or more years. As a result, LFG has a predictable long-term production profile which, when coupled with the expectation of continued landfill waste growth in the United States for the next 30 years, creates predictable long-term LFG feedstock.
To capitalize on this feedstock opportunity, and to help landfill owners meet growing regulatory requirements for curbing GHG emissions, we enter into long-term gas rights and site lease agreements with landfill owners. The agreement terms are typically at least 20 years. In most cases, the agreements contain renewal provisions. With respect to all of our existing or proposed LFG-to-RNG Biogas Conversion Projects currently in operation or under construction (a total of 12 projects), all but one relates to landfills that are currently open and accepting more waste, which we believe provides a high degree of visibility into the long-term volumes of RNG capable of being generated as each of these projects.
Using proven gas purification technology, biogas can be processed onsite to remove impurities, and used at around 50% methane to generate Renewable Power. Biogas can be further processed and upgraded to remove CO2 as well as remaining contaminants to increase the methane content and reach pipeline quality specifications, creating RNG. The resulting RNG can be used for all purposes suitable for traditional fossil fuel-based natural gas such as vehicle fuel (e.g., for consumer, industrial and transportation uses, or further converted to renewable hydrogen). RNG can be transported using existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure or through tube trailers. This is an important factor that enables OPAL to design, develop and operate RNG projects to generate value from production of RNG and the associated Environmental Attributes (i.e., RINs and LCFS credits) throughout the United States.
Overview of Livestock Sources
Livestock are the top agricultural source of GHG worldwide, according to the EPA. Livestock waste, particularly from dairies, produces biomethane which can be converted to RNG. After being converted to RNG, it can be sold as RNG for consumer, industrial and transportation uses, or further converted to renewable hydrogen. When RNG is produced from livestock waste and used as a vehicle fuel, it effectively reduces emissions from the transportation fleets and also from the livestock facilities that otherwise do not have to collect such methane and is often considered carbon negative. Additionally, revenues generated from dispensing RNG produced from livestock farms can be significantly higher than dispensing revenue from RNG produced from landfills due to state-level low-carbon fuel incentives for these projects.
We view dairy farms as a significant opportunity for us to expand our RNG business. Processing biogas from dairy farms requires similar expertise and capabilities as processing biogas from landfills.
The presence of our digester benefits dairy farmers in a number of ways, creating a mutually beneficial relationship. We assist in managing the waste for the dairy farmer, which they would otherwise have to manage. Additionally, processing this waste in a digester is significantly more environmentally friendly by reducing GHG emissions. Finally, a byproduct of the production process can be returned to farmers for use as bedding, alleviating the need to purchase other materials for bedding for the cows and/or adding a revenue stream for the dairy farmer when sold to third parties.
Highly Fragmented Market
The LFG market is heavily fragmented, which we believe represents an opportunity for companies like us to find project opportunities. According to the EPA, the top ten players account for approximately 54% of installed LFG 
8


capacity as of December 31, 2022, and over 90% of developers own five or fewer projects. This market dynamic creates the opportunity for consolidation by well capitalized, experienced market participants such as OPAL.
While LFG has accounted for most of the growth in Biogas Conversion Projects to date, we believe additional economically viable LFG project opportunities exist. According to the EPA LMOP project database, as of August 2022, there were 538 LFG projects in operation in the United States, including 366 operating LFG-to-electricity projects that may be converted to produce RNG as well as 470 additional candidate landfills. Based on EPA data, these 470 candidate landfills have the potential to collect a combined 326.7 million standard cubic feet of LFG per day. Based on our industry experience, technical knowledge and analysis, we believe many of these sites are potentially economically viable for RNG project acquisitions.
Biogas from livestock farm waste also represents a significant opportunity for RNG production that remains largely untapped. According to the US Department of Agriculture, as of June 2018, biogas recovery systems are feasible at 2,704 incremental dairy farms and 5,409 incremental swine farms in the United States. These farms have the potential to produce roughly 172.0 million MMBtu of RNG annually, or the equivalent of the CO2 emissions from over 1.3 billion gallons of gasoline. Although many of the EPA identified project sites are not currently economically viable because of distance from pipelines and contaminants in the biogas, among other reasons as described above, we believe there is potential for sustained growth in biogas conversion from livestock waste sources given our experience in evaluating sites and assessing their viability, evolving consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, ongoing waste industry trends, and project economics. Additionally, all-in prices paid for RNG from livestock farms can be significantly higher than prices for RNG from landfills due to state-level LCFS incentives for these projects. Given our understanding of biogas processing and our market leadership in RNG, including access to a broad network of Fueling Stations for dispensing, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities in this emerging market. Our first dairy development project, Sunoma, is located at Paloma Dairy and came online in November 2021.
Well-Established Regulatory Framework
RINs are credits used by Obligated Parties for regulatory compliance as part of the RFS program. The RFS program is a federal law introduced in 2005 and updated in 2007 to incorporate renewable content into various transportation fuels. Through this RFS program, RINs can be sold to counterparties in order for them to meet their renewable standard requirements. RNG from landfills and livestock waste, among other sources, qualifies as a cellulosic biofuel with a 60% GHG reduction requirement (“D3”) RIN, which is currently the highest priced RIN and commands a premium compared to non-cellulosic renewable fuels such as ethanol and renewable diesel.
We generate RINs when RNG is dispensed into vehicles as transportation fuel, and the RINs can then be sold to, and traded with, market participants who can either retire them or trade them again. By using the RINs, Obligated Parties retire the RINs for compliance purposes. Market participants in the RIN program typically include Obligated Parties and registered RIN market participants. Participants include both domestic and foreign companies.
The LCFS programs are state-level market-based programs designed to decrease CI and GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Currently, California and Oregon have established LCFS programs. Additionally, multiple jurisdictions are considering implementation of LCFS programs; for example Canada has proposed programs and Washington State’s program will begin in 2023.
The LCFS programs are attractive because the LCFS credits can be additive to RINs. In California, the most established program, the LCFS program is administered by the CARB, which sets annual CI standards. Fuel producers in the transportation fuel pool that have lower CI scores than the target established by CARB generate LCFS credits, and those with higher CI scores than the annual standard will generate deficits. A fuel producer with deficits must have enough LCFS credits through either generation or acquisitions to be in annual compliance with the annual standard. OPAL is poised to take advantage of the LCFS programs given that RNG from dairies has very low or negative CI, and therefore generates valuable credits in states with LCFS programs. Although not included in OPAL’s base case model, landfill RNG projects can attract LCFS credits as well but are not as valuable as the lower CI dairy RNG credits.
Currently, it is estimated that RNG production in the United States can only cover about 1% of the US heavy and medium-duty vehicles fuel market. RNG production is projected to triple by 2027, increasing the RNG industry share to as much as 2.5%. Although it is likely utilities and other consumers will compete with the vehicle fuel market to acquire such RNG, we believe there is adequate potential to continue placing RNG volumes into the transportation market. The legislated D3 RIN requirements are many multiples of current industry production. The EPA sets an RVO each year 
generally in excess of what the industry is expected to produce but well below the statutory requirement. The EPA has sharply increased the required volume of the D3 RINS in recent years, with the current D3 RIN RVO level encouraging growth in the industry.
Economic Benefits Incentivize Switching to RNG
RNG vehicles, especially heavy and medium-duty commercial vehicles, not only have a lower cost of ownership than similar vehicles running on diesel, they also have a lower cost of ownership than their renewable energy peers, especially hydrogen and battery electric vehicles, assuming expected D3 RINs and LCFS pricing. This comparative advantage creates significant economic incentives for heavy and medium-duty commercial vehicle owners to favor RNG.
Our Projects
As of the date of this report, we owned and operated 25 projects, seven of which are RNG projects and 18 of which are Renewable Power Projects. As of that date, our RNG projects in operation had a design capacity of 3.9 million MMBtus per year and our Renewable Power Projects in operation had a nameplate capacity of 118.6 MW per hour. In addition to these projects in operation, we are actively pursuing expansion of our RNG-generating capacity and, accordingly, have a portfolio of RNG projects in construction or in development, with four of our current Renewable Power Projects being considered candidates for conversion to RNG projects in the foreseeable future. 
Below is a table setting forth the RNG projects in operation and construction in our portfolio:

 | Design capacity (MMbtus per year) (1) | Source of bio gas | Ownership (2)
RNG projects in operation: | | | 
Greentree | 1,061,712 | | LFG | 100%
Imperial | 1,061,712 | | LFG | 100%

(1) The Design capacity represents the Company's proportional ownership in the project. Design capacity may not reflect actual production of RNG from the projects, which will depend on many variables including, but not limited to, quantity and quality of the biogas, operational up-time of the facility, and actual productivity of the facility. 
(2) Certain projects have provisions that will adjust, or “flip,” the percentage of distributions to be made to us over time, typically triggered by achievement of hurdle rates that are calculated as internal rates of return on capital invested in the project.
(3) We record our ownership interests in these projects as equity method investments in our consolidated financial statements. 
Competition
Our primary competition is from other companies or solutions for access to biogas from waste. Evolving consumer preferences, regulatory conditions, ongoing waste industry trends, and project economics have a strong effect on the competitive landscape and our relative ability to continue to generate revenues and cash flows. We believe based on (i) our status as one of the largest operators of LFG-to-RNG projects, (ii) our over 20-year track record of operating and developing projects, (iii) our vertically integrated business platform, (iv) our deep relationships with some of the largest landfill owners and (v) our relationships with dairy farms in the country, we are well-positioned to continue to operate and grow its portfolio and respond to competitive pressures. We have demonstrated a track record of strategic flexibility across our over 20-year history which has allowed us to pivot towards projects and markets that we believe deliver optimal returns and shareholder value in response to changes in market, regulatory and competitive pressures.
The biogas market is heavily fragmented. We believe both our size compared to other LFG companies and our capital structure puts us in a strong position to compete for new project development opportunities or acquisitions of existing projects. However, competition for such opportunities, including the prices being offered for gas supply, will impact the expected profitability of projects, and may make projects unsuitable to pursue. Likewise, prices being offered by our competitors for fuel supply may increase the royalty rates that we pay under our fuel supply agreements when such agreements expire and need to be renewed or when expansion opportunities present themselves at the landfills where our projects currently operate. It is also possible that more landfill owners and dairy farm owners may seek to install their own RNG production facilities on their sites, which would reduce the number of opportunities for us to develop new projects. Our overall size, reputation, access to capital, experience and decades of proven execution on LFG project development and operation position us to compete strongly amongst our industry peers.
Governmental Regulation
General
Each of our projects is subject to federal, state and local air quality, solid waste, and water quality regulations and other permitting requirements. Specific construction and operating permit requirements may differ among states. Specific permits we frequently must obtain when developing our projects include: air permits, nonhazardous waste management permits, pollutant discharge elimination permits, zoning and beneficial use permits. Our existing projects must also maintain compliance with relevant federal, state and local EHS requirements.
Our RNG projects are subject to federal RFS program regulations, including the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPACT 2005”) and EISA. The EPA administers the RFS program with volume requirements for several categories of renewable fuels. The EPA’s RFS regulations establish rules for fuel supplied and administer the RIN system for compliance, trading credits and rules for waivers. The EPA calculates a blending standard for each year based on estimates of gasoline usage from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Agency. Separate quotas and blending requirements are determined for cellulosic biofuels, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuels and total renewable fuel. Further, we are required to register each RNG project with the EPA and relevant state regulatory agencies. We qualify our RINs through a voluntary Quality Assurance Plan, which typically takes from three to five months from first injection of RNG into the commercial pipeline system. Further, we typically make a large investment in the project prior to receiving the regulatory approval and RIN qualification. In addition to registering each RNG project, we are subject to quarterly audits under the Quality Assurance Plan of our projects to validate our qualification.
Our RNG projects are also subject to state renewable fuel standard regulations. By way of example, the LCFS program in California requires producers of petroleum-based fuels to reduce the CI of their products by at least 10% by 2020 and 20% by 2030 from a 2010 baseline. Petroleum importers, refiners and wholesalers can either develop their own low-carbon fuel products or buy California LCFS credits from other companies that develop and sell low-carbon alternative fuels, such as biofuels, electricity, natural gas or hydrogen. We are subject to a qualification process similar to that for RINs, including verification of CI levels and other requirements that currently exists for LCFS credits in California.
The EPA under the Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) regulates emissions of pollutants to protect the environment and public health and contains provisions for New Source Review (the “NSR”) permits and Title V permits. New Biogas Conversion Projects may be required to obtain construction permits under the NSR program. The combustion of biogas results in emissions of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. The CAA and state and local laws and regulations impose significant monitoring, testing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for these emissions. Requirements vary for control of these emissions, depending on local air quality. Applicability of the NSR permitting requirements will depend on the level of emissions resulting from the technology used and the project’s location. Many Biogas Conversion Projects must obtain operating permits that satisfy Title V of the 1990 CAA Amendments. The operating permit describes the emission limits and operating conditions that a facility must satisfy and specifies the reporting requirements that a facility must meet to show compliance with all applicable air pollution regulations. A Title V operating permit must be renewed every five years. Even when a biogas project does not require a Title V permit, the project may be subject to other federal, state and/or local air quality regulations and permits.
In addition, our operations and the operations of the landfills at which we operate may be subject to New Source Performance Standards and emissions guidelines, pursuant to the CAA, applicable to municipal solid waste landfills and to oil and gas facilities. Among other things, these regulations are designed to address the emission of methane, a potent GHG, into the atmosphere.
Before an RNG project can be developed, all the Resource Conservation and Recovery (the “RCRA”) Subtitle D requirements (requirements for nonhazardous solid waste management) must be satisfied. In particular, methane is explosive in certain concentrations and poses a hazard if it migrates beyond the project boundary. Biogas collection systems must meet RCRA Subtitle D standards for gas control. RNG projects may be subject to other federal, state and local regulations that impose requirements for nonhazardous solid waste management.
Certain Biogas Conversion Projects may be subject to federal requirements to prepare for and respond to spills or releases from tanks and other equipment located at these projects and provide training to employees on operation, maintenance and discharge prevention procedures and the applicable pollution control laws. At such projects, we may be required to develop spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans to memorialize our preparation and response plans and to update them on a regular basis.
Our operations may result in liability for hazardous substances or other materials placed into soil or groundwater. Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or other federal, state or local laws governing the investigation and cleanup of sites contaminated with hazardous substances, we may be required to investigate and/or remediate soil and groundwater contamination at our projects, contiguous and adjacent properties and other properties owned and/or operated by third parties.
Additionally, Biogas Conversion Projects may need to obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits if wastewater is discharged directly to a receiving water body. If wastewater is discharged to a local sewer system, Biogas Conversion Projects may need to obtain an industrial wastewater permit from a local regulatory authority for discharges to a Publicly Owned Treatment Works. The authority to issue these permits may be delegated to state or local governments by the EPA. The permits, which typically last five years, limit the quantity and concentration of pollutants that may be discharged. Permits may require wastewater treatment or impose other operating conditions to ensure compliance with the limits. In addition, the Clean Water Act and implementing state laws and regulations require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
FERC
FERC regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce pursuant to its regulatory authority under the Federal Power Act. FERC also regulates certain natural gas transportation and storage facilities and services, and regulates the rates and terms of service for natural gas transportation in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act.
With respect to electricity transmission and sales, FERC’s jurisdiction includes, among other things, authority over the rates, charges and other terms for the sale of electricity at wholesale by public utilities (entities that own or operate projects subject to FERC jurisdiction) and for transmission services. With respect to its regulation of the transmission of electricity, FERC requires transmission providers to provide open access transmission services, which supports the 
development of competitive markets by assuring nondiscriminatory access to the transmission grid. FERC has also encouraged the formation of RTOs to allow greater access to transmission services and certain competitive wholesale markets administered by ISOs and RTOs.
In 2005, the U.S. federal government enacted the EPACT 2005 conferring new authority for FERC to act to limit wholesale market power if required and strengthening FERC’s civil penalty authority (including the power to assess fines of up to $1.3 million per day per violation, as adjusted due to inflation), and adding certain disclosure requirements. EPACT 2005 also directed FERC to develop regulations to promote the development of transmission infrastructure, which provides incentives for transmitting utilities to serve renewable energy projects and expanded and extended the availability of U.S. federal tax credits to a variety of renewable energy technologies, including wind power. EPACT 2005’s market conduct, penalty and enforcement provisions also apply to fraud and certain other misconduct in the natural gas sector.
Qualifying Facilities
The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act established a class of generating facilities that would receive special rate and regulatory treatment, termed QFs. There are two categories of QFs: qualifying small power production facilities and qualifying cogeneration facilities. A small power production facility is a generating facility of 80 MW or less whose primary energy source is hydro, wind, solar, biomass, waste, or geothermal. A cogeneration facility is a generating facility that produces electricity and another form of useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) in a way that is more efficient than the separate production of both forms of energy. QFs are generally subject to reduced regulatory requirements. Small power production facilities up to 20 MW and “eligible” facilities as defined by section 3(17)(E) of the Federal Power Act are exempt from rate regulation under Sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act.
In addition, PUHCA provides FERC and state regulatory commissions with access to the books and records of holding companies and other companies in holding company systems. It also provides for the review of certain costs. Companies that are holding companies under PUHCA solely with respect to one or more exempt wholesale generators, certain QFs or foreign utility companies are exempt from these PUHCA books and records requirements.
State Utility Regulation
While federal law provides the utility regulatory framework for our sales of electricity at wholesale in interstate commerce, there are also important areas in which state regulatory control over traditional public utilities that fall under state jurisdiction may have an effect on our projects. For example, the regulated electricity utility buyers of electricity from our projects are generally required to seek state public utility commission approval for the pass through in retail rates of costs associated with PPAs entered into with a wholesale seller. Certain states, such as New York, regulate the acquisition, divestiture, and transfer of some wholesale power projects and financing activities by the owners of such projects. California, which is one of our markets, requires compliance with certain operations and maintenance reporting requirements for wholesale generators. In addition, states and other local agencies require a variety of environmental and other permits.
State law governs whether an independent generator or power marketer can sell retail electricity in that state, and whether gas can be sold by an entity other than a traditional, state-franchised gas utility. Some states, such as Florida, prohibit most sales of retail electricity except by the state’s franchised utilities. In other states, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania, an independent generator may sometimes sell retail electricity power to a co-located or adjacent business customer, and a gas supplier can sometimes make on-premises or adjacent-premises gas deliveries to a single plant or customer. Some states, such as Massachusetts and New York, permit retail power and gas marketers to use the facilities of the state’s franchised utilities to sell power and/or gas to retail customers as competitors of the utilities.
RNG Production and Sale
Our projects typically convert biogas to RNG for sale as a fuel product. FERC regulates the natural gas pipelines that transport gas in interstate commerce, and specifies or approves a gas pipeline’s tariff that sets the rates, terms and conditions, gas quality, and other requirements applicable to transportation of natural gas on the pipelines, including shipping RNG. Our sites are not permitted, and may not be physically able, to deliver RNG to a FERC-regulated pipeline unless the pipeline’s receipt of the gas is consistent with the standards adopted in the pipeline’s FERC tariff. State regulators determine whether RNG may be purchased by the state’s local gas utilities, and whether a site operator may directly sell gas to a retail, or direct end-use, customer. Purely local gas sales not utilizing FERC-regulated or certificated facilities are typically not subject to FERC gas regulation. The local distribution of gas to end-use customers by a state-
regulated gas utility is also typically outside the scope of FERC’s gas regulatory jurisdiction. The opening and operation of a landfill or dairy farm that is expected to produce gas does not ordinarily require a FERC certificate or the acceptance by FERC of a gas tariff.
Future Regulations
The regulations that are applicable to our projects vary according to the type of energy being produced and the jurisdiction of the facility. As part of our growth strategy, we are looking to grow by pursuing development and acquisition opportunities. Such opportunities may exist in jurisdictions where we have no current operations and, as such, we may become exposed to different regulations for which we have no experience. Some states periodically revisit their regulation of electricity and gas sales. Other states, such as South Carolina and Florida, have adhered to traditional exclusive franchise practices, and in these and other states most electricity and gas customers may receive service only from a utility that holds an exclusive geographic franchise to provide service at that customer’s location. In some states that have experienced energy price hikes or market volatility, such as New York, Texas and California, investments in expanding facilities or buying or building additional facilities may be subject to changing regulatory requirements that may encourage competitive market entry.
Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on Our Business
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations on the international, federal, state and local levels, including energy, environmental, conservation, tax and other laws and regulations relating to our industry. Failure to comply with any laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations.
We believe our operations comply in all material respect with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive an effect on our operations than on other similar companies in our industry. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to comply with international, federal and state environmental requirements. See “Business — Legal Proceedings.”
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters are located in White Plains, New York, where we occupy approximately 13,600 square feet of shared office space with an affiliate of Fortistar pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement. We believe this office space is adequate for our needs for the immediate future and that, should it be necessary, we can lease additional space to accommodate any future growth.
Our services office and maintenance facility is located in Oronoco, Minnesota, where we own and occupy a 20,000 square foot building of combined office space, maintenance shop and loading dock located on 3.25 acres. The building was acquired in September 2018 and is adequate for our needs for the immediate future. Should it be necessary, we believe we can expand the building to accommodate future growth.
Our construction office and maintenance facility is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, where we occupy approximately 29,935 square feet of combined office space, maintenance shop and loading dock. In March, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to the lease which extended the lease term till January 2026. We believe the space that we currently lease is adequate for our needs for the immediate future but we will likely seek additional space during the course of 2023 to accommodate future growth, which we believe will be available to us on satisfactory terms.
