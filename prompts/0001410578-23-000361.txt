ITEM 1. BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
General
theglobe.com, inc. (the “Company,” “theglobe,” “we” or “us”) was incorporated on May 1, 1995 and commenced operations on that date. Originally, we were an online community with registered members and users in the United States and abroad. On September 29, 2008, we consummated the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary, Tralliance Corporation (“Tralliance”), to Tralliance Registry Management Company, LLC (“Tralliance Registry Management”), an entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result of and on the effective date of the sale of our Tralliance business, which was our last remaining operating business, we became a “shell company,” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with no material operations or assets.
On December 20, 2017, Delfin Midstream LLC (“Delfin”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with certain of our stockholders for the purchase of a total of 312,825,952 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), representing approximately 70.9% of our Common Stock.
As a shell company, our operating expenses have consisted primarily of, and we expect them to continue to consist primarily of, customary public company expenses, including personnel, accounting, financial reporting, legal, audit and other related public company costs.
As of December 31, 2022, as reflected in our accompanying Balance Sheet, our current liabilities exceed our total assets. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, unless we are successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern for any significant length of time in the future. Notwithstanding the above, we currently intend to continue operating as a public company and make all the requisite filings under the Exchange Act.
EMPLOYEES
As of March 3, 2023, we had no employees. Our executive officer currently devotes very limited time to our business and receives no compensation from us. Our executive officer is an officer, director and/or stockholder of other companies which may have ongoing business relationships with the Company. See the section in this annual report entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our management may have other interests that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders.”
