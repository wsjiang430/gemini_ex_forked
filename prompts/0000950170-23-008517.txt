Item 1. Business
Our Business
 We are a clinical-stage company with a pipeline of therapies designed to activate the body’s immune system to fight cancer and infections, including immune-modulatory antibodies, adoptive cell therapies (through our subsidiary MiNK Therapeutics, Inc. (“MiNK”)) and vaccine adjuvants (through our subsidiary SaponiQx, Inc. (“SaponiQx”)). This robust product pipeline is supported by our in-house capabilities, including current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) manufacturing and a clinical operations platform. Our primary focus is immuno-oncology (“I-O”), and our business is designed to drive success through speed, innovation and effective combination therapies. We believe that a deep understanding of each patient’s cancer and the potential to deliver combination therapies will drive substantial expansion of the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. In addition to a diverse pipeline, we have assembled fully integrated end-to-end capabilities including novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line development and cGMP manufacturing. We believe that these fully integrated capabilities enable us to produce novel candidates on timelines that are shorter than the industry standard. Leveraging our science and capabilities, we have forged important partnerships to advance our innovation.
We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will build on clinically validated antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 combined with novel immunomodulatory agents designed to address underlying tumor escape mechanisms. Our most advanced antibody candidates are botensilimab (a proprietary next-generation Fc-engineered CTLA-4 antibody, also known as AGEN1811) and balstilimab (a PD-1 antibody).
 Botensilimab is designed to improve the magnitude of responses to first-generation CTLA-4 antibodies, to expand the population of patients currently benefiting from CTLA-4 therapy, and to reduce or eliminate side effects that lead to treatment discontinuation. Botensilimab is currently in three Phase 2 studies as a monotherapy (melanoma), in combination with chemotherapy (pancreatic cancer), and in combination with balstilimab (microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (“MSS CRC”)). We recently reported updated data from the Phase 1b study at the American Society of Clinical Oncology – Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (“ASCO GI”) in January 2023, which demonstrated an overall response rate (“ORR”) of 23% and disease control rate (“DCR”) of 76% for the botensilimab/balstilimab combination in an expanded cohort of 70 heavily pre-treated patients with MSS CRC, which suggests a superior benefit compared to what has been reported for standard of care (“SOC”) and other investigational therapies. At the Society for Immunotherapy Cancer (“SITC”) meeting in November 2022, we reported response rates of 26% for platinum-refractory ovarian cancer, 42% for advanced sarcoma, and 60% for anti-PD(L)-1 relapsed/refractory non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), all exceeding the response rates that have been reported for other PD-(L)1 + CTLA-4 combination regimens in comparable patient populations. In total, botensilimab alone and in combination with balstilimab have demonstrated durable clinical responses across nine cold and treatment-resistant cancers.
 Balstilimab and zalifrelimab, our first generation CTLA-4 antibody, have been evaluated in Phase 2 trials as both a monotherapy (balstilimab) and combination therapy (balstilimab/zalifrelimab) for treatment of patients with second-line cervical cancer. Both trials met their clinical endpoints. In the largest single arm Phase 2 trial to date evaluating anti PD-1 therapy in second-line cervical cancer (140 patients), balstilimab monotherapy demonstrated objective responses in both PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients, 20% and 8%, respectively, compared to pembrolizumab reported responses of 14% and 0% in a trial of 77 patients. In a separate trial, the combination of balstilimab with zalifrelimab demonstrated objective response rates in PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients of 32.8% and 9.1%, respectively, more than double the benefit reported in pembrolizumab’s label.
In addition to our lead programs, Agenus scientists have leveraged our internal discovery and translational platforms and powerful algorithms to develop a pipeline of molecules that are intended to address key aspects of antitumor immunity and tumor resistance mechanisms, by modulating myeloid cell biology, conditioning the tumor microenvironment, and augmenting the activity of immune cells. Some of these novel agents are advancing to the clinic via the Agenus pipeline or via partnering relationships. Given the diversity of our pipeline, we are well positioned to advance differentiated combination therapies with our goal being to enhance response rates and thereby benefit patients who are unresponsive to current immunotherapies.
Additionally, in October 2021, we completed the initial public offering (“IPO”) of MiNK, trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “INKT”. MiNK is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing allogeneic invariant natural killer T (“iNKT”) cell therapies to treat cancer and other life-threatening immune diseases. MiNK’s most advanced product candidate, agenT-797, is an off-the-shelf, allogeneic, native iNKT cell therapy. MiNK has commenced and enrolled a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of solid tumors as a monotherapy and in combination with commercially approved checkpoint inhibitors (KEYTRUDA® and OPDIVO®). MiNK is also evaluating agenT-797 as a variant-agnostic therapy for patients with viral acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”) and published top-line data from this Phase 1 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2021, reporting a 77% survival rate in older, mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure.


To succeed in I-O, innovation and speed are paramount. We are a vertically integrated biotechnology company equipped with a suite of technology platforms to advance from novel target identification through manufacturing for clinical trials of antibodies and cell therapies.
 Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AGEN.”
 
Our Vision
 We believe that combination therapies and a deep understanding of each patient’s cancer will be key drivers of success in substantially expanding the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. In addition, delivering innovation with speed is critical for our future success, as drug development timelines in oncology shorten while product obsolescence rates climb. We believe our fully integrated, end-to-end capabilities from our artificial intelligence-powered VISION platform for novel target discovery, antibody generation, and cell line development to our cGMP manufacturing and clinical development and operations capabilities, together with a comprehensive and complementary portfolio will uniquely position us to produce novel therapies on accelerated timelines. We believe that a balanced pipeline of product candidates should focus on both validated targets as well as novel targets designed to address tumor escape mechanisms. In this context, CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists are recognized as the first clinically validated immunotherapy combination. These therapeutic targets, in combination with innovative immunomodulatory antibodies, cell therapies, or immune educating vaccines, are reasonably anticipated to be focal points of the next generation of I-O combination therapies. Therefore, we plan to develop, register and launch proprietary antibodies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 aggressively through the clinic and expand with novel combination therapies designed to improve clinical response and the durability of response of existing therapies.
Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to bring innovative combination therapies for cancer patients to substantially expand the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. Our diverse pipeline of antibody-based therapeutics, cell therapies, and vaccine adjuvants enable us to pursue therapeutically relevant approaches focused on safe and effective therapeutic agent combinations. In line with this approach, we are pursuing clinical trials designed to strengthen the efficacy and safety signals demonstrated to date and that may support a potential filing for full approval and/or accelerated approval based on the magnitude of benefit demonstrated.
Our strategies for our more novel, earlier stage development programs are to leverage learnings from prior programs to address limitations of first-generation molecules and build a portfolio that addresses resistance mechanisms. Our clinical portfolio also includes a number of differentiated approaches to novel I-O targets, including TIGIT, LAG-3, ILT4, ILT2, and CD137. For example, our CD137 agonist, AGEN2373, was designed to be conditionally active in the tumor microenvironment and has demonstrated clinical activity without evidence of liver toxicity that have stalled other clinical-stage CD137 therapies. These agents are being pursued in PD-1 combinations, as well as unique combinations driven by biology and clinical experience, such as our combination study evaluating botensilimab with CD137 (AGEN2373) antibodies in PD-1 relapsed or refractory melanoma.
 We are advancing our portfolio through a combination of independent development and strategic partnerships with industry leaders.

 Our proprietary QS-21 STIMULON is considered to be one of the most potent adjuvants known. By way of example, QS-21 STIMULON is a key component in the adjuvant in several GSK vaccines, including GSK’s Shingrix, which reported sales in excess of $3.5 billion in 2022. Sales in 2019 triggered a $15.1 million milestone payment to us from Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “HCR”), which we received in 2020. Sales in 2022 triggered a $25.25 million milestone payment to us from HCR, which we received in 2022. In 2019, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a grant to develop an alternative, plant cell culture-based manufacturing process to ensure continuous future supplies of QS-21 STIMULON, which we are pursuing through SaponiQx in partnership with Phyton Biotech and Ginkgo Bioworks.
Our Antibody Discovery Platforms and Immunotherapy Programs
 Immunotherapies regulate the body’s immune response to cancer, and have achieved positive outcomes in a number of cancers that were considered untreatable only a few years ago. Our pipeline includes several classes of immunotherapies:
 1.checkpoint inhibitors, which remove the tumor’s defenses that evade and suppress the immune system;
 2.immune activators, which train and activate a patient’s own immune cells for a potent and durable anti-cancer response; and
 3.tumor microenvironment ("TME") conditioning agents, which reduce local immune-suppression and attract immune cells to the cancer site.
 We possess end-to-end capabilities in-house – from discovery through to manufacturing – that have enabled us to advance our discoveries at lower costs with efficiency and speed. These product development advantages allow us to manage a large portfolio of discoveries; and have given rise to clinical stage antibody candidates, pre-clinical programs, and partnerships (i.e., with BMS, Gilead, Incyte, Merck, GSK and Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (“Betta”)).
Over approximately the past nine months, we and our partners have reported the following clinical data on our immunotherapy programs:



•Updated clinical data from a Phase 1/2 trial of botensilimab as monotherapy and in combination with Agenus’ PD-1 antibody balstilimab, which showed robust responses in nine different treatment-resistant cancers. Response data for the botensilimab/balstilimab combination were reported in four specific disease cohorts:
 oASCO GI 2023: 2L+ MSS mCRC (70 evaluable patients): ORR of 23% vs. 1-2% (SOC) vs. 1-5% (other PD-1/CTLA-4 therapies)
 ▪12-month overall survival of 63% (vs. reported 12-month overall survival of ~25% for SOC); median Overall Survival not yet reached
 oSITC 2022: 2L+ Ovarian (19 evaluable patients): ORR of 26% vs. ~10% (SOC) vs. 3-10% (other PD-1/CTLA-4 therapies)
 oCTOS 2022: 2L+ Sarcoma (13 evaluable patients): ORR of 46% vs. ~10% (SOC) vs. 12-16% (other PD-1/CTLA-4 therapies)
 oSITC 2022: PD-(L)1 Refractory NSCLC (5 evaluable patients): ORR of 60% vs. ~10% (SOC) vs. 6-13% (other PD-1/CTLA-4 therapies)
 •Preliminary data from a Phase 1 trial of iNKT cell therapy agenT-797 showing reductions in target and non-target lesions or disease stabilization in patients with solid tumor cancers when administered alone (27%) and in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) or nivolumab (OPDIVO®) (66%); in multiple myeloma, agenT-797 treatment resulted in durable disease stabilization and modulation of M-spike protein seen in heavily pre-treated r/r multiple myeloma patients (2/8) after ≥6 prior lines of therapy; and
 •Data from a Phase 1 trial of iNKT cell therapy demonstrating a pronounced survival rate of 70% in mechanically ventilated elderly COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe viral ARDS after a single dose of agenT-797 compared to ~10% in a comparative case control population; further, agenT-797 treatment was associated with a reduction in secondary infections, including reduced incidence of pneumonia at the highest dose level, a driver of intensive care unit mortality.
 With respect to our novel discovery pipeline, our most recently filed investigational new drug application (“IND”) was for AGEN1571, an ILT2 antagonist designed to modulate tumor-associated macrophages, T, NK and NKT cells. At the 2022 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, we published data showing superior performance of AGEN1571 to its only other known direct clinical-stage competitor, with:
•~10-fold higher binding affinity to all isoforms of ILT2, enabling superior binding to cells expressing low levels of ILT2;
 •Complete blockade of ILT2-ligand interactions for more effective immune activation and anti-tumor therapeutic potential;
 •Enhanced activation of T, NK, and NKT cells for improved tumor killing;
 •Superior ability to switch myeloid cells to a pro-inflammatory state, which further boosts T and NK cell immunity; and
 •Higher potency in boosting endogenous anti-tumor immunity to synergize with the patient’s anti-tumor antibodies or targeted therapies.
 We have initiated a Phase 1 study of AGEN1571 as monotherapy, and in combination with botensilimab +/- balstilimab, in solid tumors.
 In October 2021, we announced the withdrawal of our Biologics Licensing Application (“BLA”) for balstilimab monotherapy to treat second-line cervical cancer. Our decision came at the recommendation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) following the full approval of pembrolizumab, four months earlier than the FDA goal date. The BLA submission for balstilimab received Fast Track and Priority Review designation from the FDA, with a target action date of December 16, 2021. As part of the BLA review process, we successfully completed three FDA inspections, with no cited issues, concerns, or Form-483s. Based on this change to the treatment landscape, we are no longer pursuing US registration for the combination of balstilimab and zalifrelimab in second-line cervical cancer.
 Partnered Programs
 In May 2021, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with BMS (the “BMS License Agreement”) pursuant to which we granted BMS an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize our proprietary TIGIT bispecific antibody program AGEN1777. Pursuant to the BMS License Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $200.0 million and are eligible to receive up to $1.36 billion in aggregate development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments plus royalties on worldwide net sales of products containing AGEN1777. In October 2021, we announced that the first patient was dosed in the AGEN1777 Phase 1 clinical trial, triggering the achievement of a $20.0 million milestone. Under the BMS License Agreement, we retain an option to access the licensed antibodies for use in clinical studies in combination with certain


of our other pipeline assets subject to certain restrictions. Additionally, we have the option, but not the obligation, to co-fund a minority of the global development costs of products containing AGEN1777 or its derivatives, in exchange for increased tiered royalties on U.S. net sales of co-funded products ranging from the mid-teens to low twenties percent and ex-U.S. net sales of co-funded products ranging from the low double digits to mid-teens percent. Finally, Agenus also has the option to co-promote AGEN1777 in the U.S.
In June 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “Betta License Agreement”) with Betta, pursuant to which we granted Betta an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize balstilimab and zalifrelimab in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, “Greater China”). Under the terms of the Betta License Agreement, we received $15.0 million upfront and are eligible to receive up to $100.0 million in milestone payments plus royalties on any future sales in Greater China. In connection with this transaction, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Betta and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Betta (“Betta HK”), pursuant to which we sold to Betta HK 4,962,779 shares of Agenus common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $20.0 million in July 2020.
 In December 2018, we entered into a series of agreements with Gilead to collaborate on the development and commercialization of up to five novel I-O therapies. Pursuant to the collaboration agreements, we received an upfront cash payment from Gilead of $120.0 million following the closing in January 2019, and Gilead also purchased 11,111,111 shares of Agenus common stock for an additional $30.0 million. At closing, Gilead received worldwide exclusive rights to our bispecific antibody, AGEN1423, as well as a right of first negotiation for two undisclosed programs. Gilead also received the exclusive option to license exclusively AGEN1223, a bispecific antibody, and AGEN2373, a monospecific antibody. In November 2020, Gilead elected to return AGEN1423 to us and to voluntarily terminate the license agreement effective as of February 4, 2021. In the third quarter of 2021, we ceased development of AGEN1223 and in October 2021, the AGEN1223 option and license agreement was formally terminated. The AGEN2373 option and license agreement and the stock purchase agreement remain in full force and effect, and we are responsible for developing AGEN2373 up to the option decision point, at which time Gilead may acquire exclusive rights to the program on option exercise. We have the right to opt-in to share Gilead’s development and commercialization costs in the United States in exchange for a profit (loss) share on a 50:50 basis and revised milestone payments. In March 2022, we received a $5.0 million clinical milestone under the AGEN2373 option agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the AGEN2373 option agreement, we remain eligible to receive a $50.0 million option exercise fee and, if exercised, up to an additional $520.0 million in aggregate milestone payments, as well as royalties on any future sales.
 In January 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Incyte to discover, develop and commercialize novel immuno-therapeutics using our antibody platforms. The collaboration was initially focused on four immunotherapy programs targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3 and LAG-3, and in November 2015, we expanded the alliance by adding three novel undisclosed immunotherapy targets. Pursuant to the terms of the original agreement, Incyte paid us $25.0 million in upfront cash. Targets under the collaboration were designated as either profit-share programs, where the parties shared all costs and profits equally, or royalty-bearing programs, where Incyte funded all costs, and we were eligible to receive milestones and royalties. Under the original collaboration agreement, programs targeting GITR, OX40 and two of the undisclosed targets were designated as profit-share programs, while the other targets were royalty-bearing programs. For each profit-share product, we were eligible to receive up to $20.0 million in future contingent development milestones. For each royalty-bearing product, we were eligible to receive (i) up to $155.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones and (ii) tiered royalties on global net sales at rates generally ranging from 6%-12%. Concurrent with the execution of the original collaboration agreement, we and Incyte also entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Incyte purchased approximately 7.76 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million. In February 2017, we and Incyte amended the terms of the original collaboration agreement to, among other things, convert the GITR and OX40 programs from profit-share to royalty-bearing programs with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate for each. In addition, the profit-share programs relating to two undisclosed targets were removed from the collaboration, with one reverting to Incyte and one to Agenus (the latter being our Fc enhanced TIGIT program), each with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate. The remaining three royalty-bearing programs in the collaboration targeting TIM-3, LAG-3 and one undisclosed target remain unchanged, and there are no more profit-share programs under the collaboration. Pursuant to the amended agreement, we received accelerated milestone payments of $20.0 million from Incyte related to the clinical development of INCAGN1876 (GITR agonist) and INCAGN1949 (OX40 agonist). Concurrent with the execution of the amendment agreement, we and Incyte entered into a separate stock purchase agreement whereby Incyte purchased an additional 10 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million. In October 2022, Incyte notified us of their intent to terminate the OX40 program, effective October 2023. Upon termination the rights to the OX40 program revert back to us.
 In April 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Merck to discover and optimize fully-human antibodies against two undisclosed immunotherapy targets. In 2016, Merck selected a lead product candidate against ILT4, MK-4830, to advance into preclinical studies, and subsequently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in August 2018. In November 2020, Merck initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial with MK-4830, triggering a $10.0 million milestone payment to us. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck is responsible for all future product development expenses for MK-4830, and Agenus is eligible to receive potential milestone payments plus royalties on any future sales.



On September 20, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Royalty Fund, LLC, entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the “XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement”) with XOMA (US) LLC (“XOMA US”). Pursuant to the terms of the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement, XOMA US paid us $15.0 million at closing in exchange for the right to receive 33% of the future royalties and 10% of the future milestones that we are entitled to receive from Incyte and Merck, net of certain of our obligations to a third party and excluding the milestone we received from Incyte in the fourth quarter of 2018. After taking into account our obligations under the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement, as of December 31, 2022, we remain eligible to receive up to $405.0 million and $76.5 million in potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones from Incyte and Merck, respectively.
 In December 2022, we terminated our collaboration agreement with Recepta Biopharma SA (“Recepta”) for the development of balstilimab and zalifrelimab antibodies in certain South American countries and, as part of the termination, all related intellectual property rights were returned to Agenus.
 VISION
 Our broad portfolio hits many facets of the immune system. Getting the right treatments to the right patient at the right time will unlock the true potential of immunotherapy. VISION is an active learning platform that is intended to use a patient’s tumor, immune system, and health data to predict their best treatment options. Predictions are strengthened by laboratory experiments that interrogate how our drugs perform under conditions that mimic a patient’s tumor and immune system. Data from each prediction automatically feed back into the platform enabling exploration of an immense range of drug-biology interactions not possible via traditional processes. The potential impacts of VISION include faster trials with higher response rates, quicker validation of drug targets, and faster optimized drug design.
 SaponiQx & QS-21 STIMULON Adjuvant
QS-21 STIMULON is an adjuvant, which is a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy that is intended to enhance an immune response to the target antigens. QS-21 STIMULON is a natural product, a triterpene glycoside, or saponin, purified from the bark of the Chilean soapbark tree, Quillaja saponaria. QS-21 STIMULON has the ability to stimulate an antibody-mediated immune response and has also been shown to activate cellular immunity. It has become a key component in the development of investigational preventive vaccine adjuvants across a wide variety of diseases. These studies have been carried out by academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. A number of these studies have shown QS-21 STIMULON to be significantly more effective in stimulating immune responses than aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, the adjuvants most commonly used in approved vaccines in the United States today.
In September 2021, we launched SaponiQx, our subsidiary building an integrated vaccine platform based on scalable and secure manufacturing of QS-21 STIMULON and other saponin-based adjuvants. The need for vaccines offering long-lasting efficacy and efficient production was amplified in the COVID-19 pandemic. The durability offered by QS-21 STIMULON has been validated by Shingrix, with protection exceeding nine years, but the supply is limited due to reliance on a complicated and expensive extraction process from a Chilean soap bark tree. To this end, SaponiQx is working with Phyton Biotech and Ginkgo Bioworks to optimize the plant cell culture process which we have developed for the purposes of scalable manufacturing QS-21 and next-generation saponin based adjuvants. In January 2019, we announced that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a grant to develop the plant cell culture process for QS-21 STIMULON. Our goal is to establish a platform for optimized and scalable vaccine adjuvant formulations to address pandemic threats and other disease settings.
  Partnered QS-21 STIMULON Programs
 In 2006, we entered into a license agreement and a supply agreement with GSK for the use of QS-21 STIMULON (the “GSK License Agreement” and the “GSK Supply Agreement,” respectively). In 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Manufacturing Technology Transfer and Supply Agreement (the “Amended GSK Supply Agreement”) under which GSK has the right to manufacture all of its requirements of commercial grade QS-21 STIMULON. GSK is obligated to supply us, or our affiliates, licensees, or customers, certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 STIMULON for a stated period of time. In March 2012, we entered into a First Right to Negotiate and Amendment Agreement amending the GSK License Agreement and the Amended GSK Supply Agreement to clarify and include additional rights for the use of QS-21 STIMULON (the “GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement”). As consideration for entering into the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement, GSK paid us an upfront cash payment of $9.0 million, $2.5 million of which was creditable toward future royalty payments. We refer to the GSK License Agreement, the Amended GSK Supply Agreement and the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement collectively as the GSK Agreements. We are no longer entitled to any additional milestone payments under the GSK Agreements. Under the terms of the Agreement, we are generally entitled to receive a 2% royalty on net sales of prophylactic vaccines for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of a resulting GSK product, which was triggered with GSK’s first commercial sale of Shingrix in 2017. Notably, we have already monetized and sold this entire royalty stream as discussed in more detail below. The GSK License and Amended GSK Supply Agreements may be terminated by either party upon a material breach if the breach is not cured within the time specified in the


respective agreement. The termination or expiration of the GSK License Agreement does not relieve either party from any obligation which accrued prior to the termination or expiration. Among other provisions, the license rights granted to GSK survive expiration of the GSK License Agreement. The license rights and payment obligations of GSK under the Amended GSK Supply Agreement survive termination or expiration, except that GSK's license rights and future royalty obligations do not survive if we terminate due to GSK's material breach unless we elect otherwise. We do not incur clinical development costs for products partnered with GSK.
 In September 2015, we monetized a portion of the royalties associated with the GSK License Agreement to an investor group led by Oberland Capital Management for up to $115.0 million in the form of a non-dilutive royalty transaction. Under the terms of a note purchase agreement with the investor group (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), we received $100.0 million at closing for which the investors had the right to receive 100% of our worldwide royalties under the GSK License Agreement on sales of GSK’s Shingrix and malaria (RTS,S) prophylactic vaccine products that contain our QS-21 STIMULON adjuvant to pay down principle and interest. In November 2017, and pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we received an additional $15.0 million in cash from the investors based on the approval of Shingrix by the FDA. Pursuant to the terms of this transaction, we retained the right to receive all royalties from GSK after all principal, interest and other obligations were satisfied under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement also allowed us to buy back the loan and extinguish the notes early under pre-specified terms, which we did in January 2018.
 In January 2018, we sold 100% of all royalties we were entitled to receive from GSK to HCR and used the proceeds to extinguish the debt under the Note Purchase Agreement. HCR paid approximately $190.0 million at closing for the royalty rights, of which approximately $161.9 was used to extinguish the prior notes, yielding us approximately $28.0 million in net proceeds. We were also entitled to receive up to $40.35 million in milestone payments from HCR based on sales of GSK’s vaccines as follows: (i) $15.1 million upon reaching $2.0 billion last-twelve-months net sales any time prior to 2024 (the “First HCR Milestone”) and (ii) $25.25 million upon reaching $2.75 billion last-twelve-months net sales any time prior to 2026 (the “Second HCR Milestone”). GSK’s net sales of Shingrix for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, exceeded $2.0 billion. As a result, we received the First HCR Milestone of $15.1 million in 2020 after GSK’s net sales of Shingrix in 2019 exceeded $2.0 billion. GSK’s net sales of Shingrix for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, exceeded $2.75 billion. As a result, we received the Second HCR Milestone of $25.25 million in 2022.
 Manufacturing
 Antibody Manufacturing
 In December 2015, we acquired an antibody manufacturing pilot plant in Berkeley, CA from XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”), which we refer to as “Agenus West.” A team of former XOMA employees with valuable chemistry, manufacturing and controls experience joined us and continue to operate the facility. Since the acquisition of Agenus West, we have made significant improvements in the plant, and added additional headcount increasing both scale and capacity. Agenus West is currently producing antibody drug substance for certain of our proprietary antibody programs (monospecific and bispecific). In some cases, we have been able to deliver clinical grade material from research cell banks in approximately six to nine months, which is significantly faster than the industry average of 12-18 months. Agenus West utilizes cutting-edge technology platforms, enabling us to be self-reliant and giving us the advantage of drug substance manufacturing speed, cost efficiency, operational flexibility and manufacturing technology transfer to commercial scale partners—all with desired product quality, and with the goal of benefiting patients. In November 2020, we entered into a long-term lease in Emeryville, CA for cGMP commercial manufacturing space. Construction of this end-to-end 83,000sqft. GMP clinical and commercial biologics manufacturing facility (from cell line development through Drug Product fill & finish, packaging and labeling) is being commissioned for GMP manufacturing.
 The quality control organization for all of our product candidates in Berkeley and Lexington performs a series of release assays designed to ensure that our antibody drug substance meets all applicable specifications. Our quality assurance staff also reviews manufacturing and quality control records prior to batch release in an effort to assure conformance with cGMP as mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. Our manufacturing staff is trained and routinely evaluated for conformance to rigorous manufacturing procedures and quality standards. This oversight is intended to ensure compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and to provide consistent drug substance output. Our quality control and quality assurance staff are similarly trained and evaluated as part of our effort to ensure consistency in the testing and release of the product, as well as consistency in materials, equipment and facilities.
 QS-21 STIMULON
 Except in the case of GSK, we have retained worldwide manufacturing rights for QS-21 STIMULON, and we have the right to subcontract manufacturing for QS-21 STIMULON. In addition, under the terms of our agreement with GSK, upon request by us, GSK is committed to supply certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 STIMULON to us and our licensees for a fixed period.
 Intellectual Property Portfolio


We seek to protect our technologies through a combination of patents, trade secrets and know-how, and we currently own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 37 issued United States patents and approximately 124 issued foreign patents. We also own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 38 pending United States patent applications and approximately 317 pending foreign patent applications. We may not have rights in all territories where we may pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates.
  Through various acquisitions, we own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to a number of patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including methods for identifying therapeutic antibodies and product candidates arising out of such entities’ technology platforms. In particular, we own patents and patent applications relating to our Retrocyte Display technology platform, a high throughput antibody expression platform for the identification of fully-human and humanized monoclonal antibodies. This patent family is projected to expire between 2029 and 2031. We own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including a patent directed to methods for identifying phosphorylated proteins using mass spectrometry. This patent is projected to expire in 2023. In addition, as we advance our research and development efforts with our institutional and corporate collaborators, we are seeking patent protection for certain newly identified therapeutic antibodies and product candidates. We can provide no assurance that any of our patents, including the patents that we acquired or in-licensed, will have commercial value, or that any of our existing or future patent applications, including the patent applications that were acquired or in-licensed, will result in the issuance of valid and enforceable patents.
The patent rights for each of our clinical candidates, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires (not including any regulatory exclusivities such as the six-month pediatric extension and/or the granted patent term extension in the U.S. and Japan and Supplementary Patent Certificate in Europe), are those for the programs set forth in the table below. Unless otherwise indicated, the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below. In some instances, we may obtain later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable, biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

 Various patents and patent applications have been exclusively licensed to us by the following entities:



Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
 On December 5, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Switzerland Inc. (formerly known as 4-Antibody AG) (“4-AB”), entered into a license agreement with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd. (“Ludwig”), which replaced and superseded a prior agreement entered into between the parties in May 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Ludwig granted 4-AB an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights of Ludwig and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center arising from the prior agreement to further develop and commercialize GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 antibodies. On January 25, 2016, we and 4-AB entered into a second license agreement with Ludwig, on substantially similar terms, to develop CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies. Pursuant to the December 2014 license agreement, 4-AB made an upfront payment of $1.0 million to Ludwig. The December 2014 license agreement also obligates 4-AB to make potential milestone payments of up to $20.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of licensed GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 products, and potential milestone payments in excess of $80.0 million if such licensed products are approved in multiple jurisdictions, in more than one indication, and certain sales milestones are achieved. Under the January 2016 license agreement, we are obligated to make potential milestone payments of up to $12.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of CTLA-4 and PD-1 licensed products, and potential milestone payments of up to $32.0 million if certain sales milestones are achieved. Under each of these license agreements, we and/or 4-AB will also be obligated to pay low to mid-single digit royalties on all net sales of licensed products during the royalty period, and to pay Ludwig a percentage of any sublicensing income, ranging from a low to mid-double digit percentage depending on various factors. The license agreements may each be terminated as follows: (i) by either party if the other party commits a material, uncured breach; (ii) by either party if the other party initiates bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings; or (iii) by 4-AB or us (as applicable) for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The license agreements also contain customary representations and warranties, mutual indemnification, confidentiality and arbitration provisions. Effective December 31, 2022, the license was assigned to Agenus.
Regulatory Compliance
 Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of our investigational product candidates. In the United States, the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, subject pharmaceutical products to rigorous review.
 In order to obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit proof of safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product. In most cases, this proof entails extensive pre-clinical, clinical, and laboratory tests. Before approving a new drug or marketing application, the FDA may also conduct pre-licensing inspections of the company, its contract research organizations and/or its clinical trial sites to ensure that clinical, safety, quality control, and other regulated activities are compliant with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), or Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), for specific non-clinical toxicology studies. The FDA may also require confirmatory trials, post-marketing testing, and extra surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products, or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Once approved, the labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, and distribution of a drug or biologic product must be in compliance with FDA regulatory requirements.
 In Phase 1 clinical trials, the sponsor tests the product in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 1 trials in cancer are often conducted with patients who have end-stage or metastatic cancer. In Phase 2, in addition to safety, the sponsor evaluates the efficacy of the product in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically dispersed test sites. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time.
 The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of pre-clinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in the form of a new drug application (“NDA”), or in the case of biologics, a BLA. In a process that can take a year or more, the FDA reviews this application and, when and if it decides that adequate data are available to show that the new compound is both safe and effective for a particular indication and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the drug or biologic for marketing.
 Whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, we must generally obtain approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of international jurisdictions prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those jurisdictions. We are also subject to cGMP, GCP, and GLP compliance obligations and are subject to inspection by international regulatory authorities. International requirements may in some circumstances be more rigorous than U.S. requirements and may require additional investment in manufacturing process development, non-clinical studies, clinical studies, and record-keeping that are not required for U.S. regulatory compliance or approval. The time required to obtain this approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and can also require significant resources in time, money and labor.
 Under the laws of the United States, the countries of the European Union and other nations, we and the institutions where we sponsor research are subject to obligations to ensure the protection of personal information of human subjects participating in our


clinical trials. We have instituted procedures that we believe will enable us to comply with these requirements and the contractual requirements of our data sources. The laws and regulations in this area are evolving, and further regulation, if adopted, could affect the timing and the cost of future clinical development activities.
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, various radioactive compounds, and for some experiments we use recombinant DNA. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by local, state, and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. We conduct our activities in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.
 Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
 Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Many pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have products on the market and are actively engaged in the research and development of products for the treatment of cancer.
 Many competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, and technical resources, and more experience in research and development, clinical trials, and regulatory matters, than we do. Competing companies developing or acquiring rights to more efficacious therapeutic products for the same diseases we are targeting, or which offer significantly lower costs of treatment, could render our products noncompetitive or obsolete. See Part I-Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates-Our competitors may have superior products, manufacturing capability, selling and marketing expertise and/or financial and other resources.”
 Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research institutions conduct significant amounts of research in biotechnology, medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. These entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results. They also compete with us in recruiting and retaining skilled scientific talent.
 The immune-oncology drug landscape is crowded with several competitors developing assets against a number of targets. Our development plans are spread out across various indications and lines of therapy, either alone or in combination with other assets. Our competitors range from small cap to large cap companies, with assets in pre-clinical or clinical stages of development. Therefore, the landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. We and our partners have I-O antibody programs, currently in clinical stage development targeting various pathways (as mono- or multi-specifics) including PD-1, CTLA-4, GITR, TIM-3, LAG-3, CD73, TGFb, CD137, ILT2, ILT4 and TIGIT. We are aware of many companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed to the same biological targets as these programs, including, without limitation, the following: (1) BMS markets ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and relatlimab, an anti-LAG-3 antibody, and is currently developing agents targeting TIGIT, ILT4 and TGFb. BMS also has a next generation anti-CTLA-4 antibody in the clinic, which may be competitive to our next generation anti-CTLA-4 program, (2) Merck has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody, and has an anti-CTLA-4, anti-TIGIT and LAG-3 antagonists recruiting in clinical trials, (3) Regeneron has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody as well as antibodies targeting LAG-3 and GITR in the clinic, (4) Roche/Genentech has an approved anti-PD-L1 antibody, a late-stage anti-TIGIT antibody, an anti-TGFb antibody as well as bispecific antibodies targeting CD137, and LAG-3 in clinical development, (5) AstraZeneca has an approved anti PD-L1 antibody, an approved anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and has monoclonal antibodies targeting CD73, as well as bispecifics targeting CTLA-4, TIGIT, TIM-3 in clinical development (6) Pfizer has an approved anti-PD-L1 (with Merck KgaA) antibody and (7) GSK has an approved anti PD-1 antibody as well as antibodies targeting TIM-3, LAG-3 and TIGIT in the clinic. Besides these PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies that were approved in the U.S., we are also aware of competitors with approved PD-1 and PD-L1 agents in ex-U.S. geographies such as China. These include Innovent Biologics, Shanghai Junshi Biosciences (Coherus BioSciences has rights to co-develop in U.S. and Canada), Shanghai HengRui Pharmaceuticals, Beigene (Novartis has ex-China rights), CStone Pharmaceuticals (EQRx has ex-China rights), Gloria Biosciences (Arcus Bioscience has rights in North America, Europe, Japan and certain other territories), Alphamab Oncology/3D Medicines and Akeso Bio.
We are also aware of other competitors with clinical-stage PD-1/PD-L1 agents including but not limited to AbbVie, Amgen, Arcus Biosciences, Biocad Ltd., Boehringer Ingelheim, Checkpoint Therapeutics, CSPC ZhongQi Pharmaceutical Technology, Genor Biopharma/ Apollomics, Incyte, ImmuneOncia Therapeutics Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Lee’s Pharmaceuticals, Transcenta Holdings (previously Mabspace Biosciences), Maxinovel Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, 3D Medicines, Qilu Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Shanghai Henlius Biotech Co Ltd, Sinocelltech, Shandong New Time Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, and Lepu Biopharma (previously


Taizhou Houdeaoke Technology). In addition, we are also aware of anti-PD-(L)1 monospecific agents that are preclinical in stage. We are also aware of competitors developing bispecifics targeting PD-1 or PD-L1.
 We are aware of companies developing “next-generation” anti-CTLA-4 approaches, which may be competitive to our next-generation anti-CTLA-4 program (AGEN1181). For example, BMS has a next-generation CTLA-4 program in the clinic, a peptide masked version of the non-fucosylated anti CTLA-4 antibody; the peptide masked version is designed to localize activity to the tumor and minimize systemic toxicity associated with parent drug. We are also aware of other next-generation monospecifics targeting CTLA-4 in the clinic, including those from Harbour BioMed, OncoC4, Adagene, and Xilio Therapeutics. We are also aware of companies advancing clinical stage, CTLA-4 targeting multispecifics as a next-generation approach, including, but not limited to, Macrogenics, Xencor, AstraZeneca, Akeso Biopharma and Alphamab. We are also aware of next-generation assets targeting CTLA-4 preclinically.
 We are also aware of competitors with clinical stage drug candidates against CTLA-4, GITR, LAG-3, TIM-3, CD73, TGFb, and CD137, in addition to those named earlier in this section. Additionally, AGEN1777, our TIGIT bispecific program licensed to BMS is now in clinical development; we are aware of clinical stage anti-TIGIT antibodies, including bispecifics, that could compete with this program. As outlined above, some of these include, but are not limited to AbbVie, Arcus Biosciences, Alligator Biosciences, Beigene, Compass Therapeutics, Compugen, Corvus Pharmaceuticals, CStone Pharmaceuticals, GSK, Innovent Biologics, Inhibrx, iTeos Therapeutics, Lyvgen Biopharma, MedPacto, Merck KGaA, Mereo Biopharma, Novartis, Seagen, Servier, Scholar Rock, and Sanofi. There is no guarantee that our antibody product candidates will be able to successfully compete with our competitors’ antibody products and product candidates.
Additionally, AGEN1571, our ILT2 antibody is now in clinical development. We are aware of other clinical stage anti-ILT2, anti-ILT4 and anti-HLA-G antibodies that could compete with this program. These include, but are not limited to, Biond Biologics/Sanofi, BMS, Merck, Immune-Onc Therapeutics and Gilead/Tizona Therapeutics. Additionally, some competitors are also developing ILT2 bispecifics; for example, NGM Biopharmaceuticals has a clinical stage bispecific co-targeting ILT2 and ILT4. We are also aware of competitor programs, in monospecific and bispecific formats, that are in preclinical development against this target. There is no guarantee that our antibody product candidates will be able to successfully compete with our competitors’ antibody products and product candidates.
In addition, and prior to regulatory approval, if ever, our other product candidates may compete for access to patients with other products in clinical development, with products approved for use in the indications we are studying, or with off-label use of products in the indications we are studying. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter markets we seek to address and scientific developments surrounding immunotherapy and other traditional cancer therapies continue to accelerate.
 SaponiQx is developing QS-21 STIMULON. Several other vaccine adjuvants are in development or in use and could compete with QS-21 STIMULON for inclusion in vaccines. These adjuvants may include but are not limited to: (1) oligonucleotides, under development by Dynavax, (2) MF59, under development by Novartis, (3) IC31, under development by Intercell (now part of Valneva), (4) MPL, under development by GSK, (5) Matrix-MTM, under development by Novavax, (6) AS03 and additional AS portfolio members, under development by GSK, and (7) TQL 1055, under development by Adjuvance Technologies. In the past, we have provided QS-21 STIMULON to other entities under materials transfer arrangements. There is a risk that material provided pursuant to a MTA is used without our permission to develop synthetic formulations and/or derivatives of QS-21. In addition, other companies and academic institutions are developing saponin adjuvants, including derivatives and synthetic formulations. These sources may be competitive to our ability to execute future partnering and licensing arrangements involving QS-21 STIMULON. We are also aware of other manufacturers of QS-21. The existence of products developed by these and other competitors, or other products of which we are not aware, or which other companies may develop in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed or sold using QS-21 STIMULON.
 Even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the availability and price of our competitors’ products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our product candidates. We may not be able to implement our business plan if the acceptance of our product candidates is inhibited by price competition or the reluctance of physicians to switch from existing methods of treatment to our product candidates, or if physicians switch to other new drug or biologic products or choose to reserve our product candidates for use in limited circumstances.
 Human Capital Resources and Employees
 As of March 1, 2023, we had 533 employees, of whom 108 were PhDs and 32 were MDs. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. We provide compensation and benefit programs to attract and retain employees. In addition to salaries, these programs include potential annual discretionary bonuses, various stock awards under our equity incentive plans, a


401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and flexible work schedules, among others.
