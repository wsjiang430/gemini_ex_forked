Item 1. Business
Armstrong Flooring, Inc. ("AFI" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2015. When we refer to "AFI," "the Company," "we," "our," and "us" in this report, we are referring to Armstrong Flooring, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We are a leading global producer of resilient flooring products for use primarily in the construction and renovation of commercial, residential and institutional buildings. We design, manufacture, source and sell flooring products primarily in North America and the Pacific Rim.
On April 1, 2016, we became an independent company as a result of the separation by Armstrong World Industries, Inc. ("AWI"), a Pennsylvania corporation, of its Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments from its Building Products segment (the "Separation"). The Separation was effected by allocating the assets and liabilities related primarily to the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments to AFI and then distributing the common stock of AFI to AWI’s shareholders (the "Distribution"). The Separation and Distribution (together, the "Spin-off") resulted in AFI and AWI becoming two independent, publicly traded companies, with AFI owning and operating the Resilient Flooring and Wood Flooring segments and AWI continuing to own and operate a ceilings business.
In November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our North American wood flooring business to Tarzan Holdco, Inc. ("TZI"), a Delaware corporation and an affiliate of American Industrial Partners ("AIP"). The sale was completed on December 31, 2018. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to discontinued operations. The historical financial results of the North American wood flooring business have been reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. 
Products and Markets
We hold leadership or significant market share positions in the product categories and markets in which we operate. We compete in the resilient flooring product category in North America and the Pacific Rim. The majority of our sales are in North America, where we serve both commercial and residential markets. In the Pacific Rim, we are principally focused on commercial markets. 
The major markets in which we compete are: 
North American Commercial — Our products are used in commercial and institutional buildings. Our revenue opportunities come from new construction as well as renovation of existing buildings. Industry analysts estimate that renovation work represents the majority of the total North American commercial market opportunity. Most of our revenue comes from four major segments of commercial building: education, healthcare, retail and office. We monitor U.S. construction starts and follow project activity. Our revenue from new construction can lag behind construction starts by as much as twenty-four months given that the installation of flooring typically occurs later in the construction process. We also monitor office vacancy rates, architectural activity, gross domestic product ("GDP") and general employment levels, which can indicate movement in renovation and new construction opportunities. We believe that these statistics, taking into account the time-lag effect, provide a reasonable indication of our future revenue opportunity from commercial renovation and new construction. We also believe that consumer preferences for product type, style, color, availability and affordability also significantly affect our revenue.
North American Residential — We sell products for use in single and multi-family housing. Homeowners, contractors, builders, and property management firms can choose from our innovative flooring products. We compete directly with other domestic and international suppliers of these products. Our flooring products also compete with carpet, stone, wood and ceramic products, which we do not offer.
Our products are used in new home construction and existing home renovation work. Industry analysts estimate that existing home renovation (also known as replacement/remodel) work represents a majority of the total

North American residential market opportunity. We monitor key U.S. statistics including existing home sales (a key indicator for renovation opportunity), housing starts, housing completions, home prices, interest rates and consumer confidence. We believe there is some longer-term correlation between these statistics and our revenue after reflecting a lag period of several months between a change in these indicators and our operating results. However, we believe that consumers’ preferences for product type, style, color, availability and affordability also significantly affect our revenue. Further, changes in inventory levels and/or product focus at national home centers and independent wholesale flooring distributors can significantly affect our revenue.
Outside of North America — We also serve commercial markets in the Pacific Rim region with over 80% of the sales in this region coming from China and Australia. The commercial segments we serve are similar to the North American market (education, retail, office and healthcare). However there is a higher penetration of resilient flooring in the hospitality (retail) and office segments in China than we see in North America. For the countries where we have significant revenue, we monitor various national statistics (such as GDP) as well as construction data (starts and project-related information).
LVT Investment — Luxury vinyl tile ("LVT") represents the fastest growing resilient flooring product category. Through enhanced wear layers and coatings, LVT delivers improved durability and lower maintenance over traditional vinyl tile. In addition, the utilization of advanced printing and embossing technology provides LVT with upgraded visual realism in a wide variety of attractive wood and stone designs. LVT’s modular format offers a wide range of installation options for the professional and do-it-yourself installer, with an enhanced ease of installation when compared to other products such as wood or ceramic tile; this can be seen with the growing popularity of floating and rigid LVT floors. The largest market for LVT is North America. Historically, this market has been largely served by imported product manufactured in the Pacific Rim. In addition to our existing LVT capacity at our Kankakee, Illinois plant, we completed construction of an expansion to our Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant in 2016 and repurposed a portion of our Stillwater, Oklahoma vinyl sheet plant in 2017 to add LVT manufacturing capacity.
The following table provides an estimate of our 2018 net sales, by major markets. 

North American Commercial | North American Residential | Outside of North America | 
New | Renovation | New | Renovation | New | Renovation | Total
5% | 35% | 5% | 35% | 15% | 5% | 100% 

Management has estimated the above data as the end-use of our products is not easily determinable.
Customers
We use our reputation, capabilities, service and brand recognition to develop long-standing relationships with our customers. We principally sell products through independent wholesale flooring distributors, who re-sell our products to retailers, builders, contractors, installers and others. In the commercial sector, we also have important relationships with subcontractors’ alliances, large architect and design firms, and major facility owners in our focus segments. In the North American retail channel, which sells to end-users in the residential and light commercial segments, we have important relationships with national home centers and flooring retailers. In the North American residential sector, we also have important relationships with major home builders and retail buying groups. Additionally, when market conditions and available capacity warrant, we also provide products on an OEM basis to other flooring companies.
Approximately 75% of our consolidated net sales in 2018 are to distributors. Sales to large home centers account for approximately 15% of our consolidated sales in 2018. Our remaining sales are primarily to other retailers, end-use customers and contractors.

The Belknap White Group, which includes J. J. Haines and Company, Inc., accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated net sales in 2018. 
Working Capital
We produce goods for inventory and sell on credit to our customers. Our distributors carry inventory as needed to meet local or rapid delivery requirements. We sell the vast majority of our products to select, pre-approved customers using customary trade terms that allow for payment in the future. These practices are typical within the industry. 
Competition
We face strong competition in all of our businesses. Principal attributes of competition include product performance, product styling, service and price. Competition in North America comes from both domestic and international manufacturers. Additionally, some of our products compete with alternative products or finishing solutions. Our resilient flooring products compete with carpet, stone, wood and ceramic products. There is excess industry capacity for certain products in some geographies, which tends to increase price competition. The following companies are our primary competitors:
Beaulieu International Group, N.V., Congoleum Corporation, Forbo Holding AG, Gerflor Group, Halstead International (including Metroflor Corporation), Interface, Inc., Krono Holding AG, Mannington Mills, Inc., Mohawk Industries, Inc., Nora Systems GmbH (division of Interface, Inc), Shaw Industries, Inc., and Tarkett AG.
Raw Materials
We purchase raw materials from numerous suppliers worldwide in the ordinary course of business. The principal raw materials include: polyvinylchloride ("PVC") resins and films, plasticizers, fiberglass and felt backings, limestone, pigments, inks, stabilizers and coatings.
We also purchase significant amounts of packaging materials and consume substantial amounts of energy, such as electricity and natural gas, and water.
In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all of our businesses. However, availability can change for a number of reasons, including environmental conditions, laws and regulations, shifts in demand by other industries competing for the same materials, transportation disruptions and/or business decisions made by, or events that affect, our suppliers. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements, we believe alternative supply arrangements would be available.
Prices for certain high usage raw materials can fluctuate dramatically. Cost increases for these materials can have a significant adverse impact on our manufacturing costs.
Sourced Products
Some of our products are sourced from third parties. Our primary sourced products include LVT, vinyl sheet, installation and maintenance materials and accessories, and laminate. We purchase most of our sourced products from suppliers that are located outside of the U.S., primarily from Asia. Sales of sourced products represented approximately 35% of our total consolidated revenue in 2018.

Seasonality
Generally, our sales in North America tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to more favorable weather conditions, customer business cycles and education renovations typical during the summer months. We see similar patterns with respect to our sales in the Pacific Rim, though the timing of the Chinese New Year can affect buying behaviors.
Patent and Intellectual Property Rights
Patent protection is important to our business. Our competitive position has been enhanced by U.S. and foreign patents on products and processes developed or perfected within AFI, including those before and after the Spin-off, or obtained through acquisitions and licenses. In addition, we benefit from our trade secrets for certain products and processes.
Patent protection extends for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of a patent in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies. Although we consider that, in the aggregate, our patents, licenses and trade secrets constitute a valuable asset of material importance to our business, we do not regard any of our businesses as being materially dependent upon any single patent or trade secret, or any group of related patents or trade secrets.
We own or have a license to use certain trademarks, including, without limitation, Armstrong®, Alterna®, BBT®, Diamond 10® Technology, Excelon®, Imperial®, Initiator™, Inspiring Great Spaces®, Lock&Fold®, Luxe Plank®, Medintech®, Memories™, Natural Creations®, Station Square™, StrataMax®, Timberline®, and Vivero®, which are important to our business because of their significant brand name recognition. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as the mark is used, and continues in other countries as long as the mark is registered. Registrations are generally for fixed, but renewable, terms.
We sublicense certain patents and trademarks to American Hardwood Flooring Company ("AHFC"), a subsidiary of TZI. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,800 full-time and part-time employees worldwide. Approximately 35% of our 900 production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions. As of March 5, 2019, approximately 150 employees at one of our domestic plants continue to work under an expired collective bargaining agreement and negotiations continue. Contracts for remaining employees expire between 2019 and 2020. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. Out of our 1,800 employees, approximately 100 employees are part of the transition services agreement with TZI, and we expect most of them to transfer to TZI by the end of 2019.

Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
AFI’s manufacturing and research facilities are affected by various federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of materials and the protection of the environment. We make expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable environmental requirements at each of our operating facilities. These regulatory requirements continually change, therefore we cannot predict with certainty future expenditures associated with compliance with environmental requirements.
We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of conducting business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, distributors and competitors, employees and other matters. For example, we are currently a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and other claims under a wide range of allegations, including illness due to exposure to certain chemicals used in the workplace, or medical conditions arising from exposure to product ingredients or the presence of trace contaminants. In some cases, these allegations involve multiple defendants and relate to legacy products that we and other defendants purportedly manufactured or sold. We believe these claims and allegations to be without merit and intend to defend them vigorously. While complete assurance cannot be given to the outcome of these proceedings, we do not believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
We have not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations. There were no material liabilities recorded at December 31, 2018 for potential environmental liabilities, on a global basis, that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the probable liability could be made. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors in this Form 10-K for information regarding the possible effects that compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have on our businesses and operating results.
