Our Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 29, 1988 under the name Cine-Source Entertainment, Inc. On April 27, 2004, the Company changed its name to First Quantum Ventures, Inc. On April 13, 2006, the Company changed its name to First Quantum Ventures, Inc., and on May 5, 2006, the Company reincorporated in Nevada. On March 15, 2012, the Company changed its name to DiMi Telematics International, Inc.
 
In early 2017, our management team elected to suspend further investment and working capital on developing its then-existing technology and business prospects, turning its attention to the hemp-derived cannabidiol, or CBD, market. On March 10, 2017, the Company changed its name to Bespoke Extracts, Inc. to align the Company’s corporate identity with its new business plan. 
 
The Company is now focused on selling its proprietary line of premium quality, all natural cannabidiol (CBD) products in the form of tinctures and capsules for the nutraceutical and veterinary markets, which it introduced in mid-2018. Produced using pure, all natural, zero-THC phytocannabinoid-rich (“PCR”) hemp-derived CBD, our products are marketed as dietary supplements and distributed through our direct-to-consumers ecommerce store, found at www.BespokeExtracts.com. In the future, we plan to also sell through select specialty retailers, pharmacies/dispensaries and care providers.

The Cannabis Market
 
Over 33 states have already legalized medical cannabis, and adult-use cannabis is now legal at the statewide level in 11 U.S. markets. According to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics in their seventh edition of “State of Legal Cannabis Markets” reports, 2018 showed a growth rate of 20 percent in the global sales of cannabis in regulated markets, with sales on track to surge 36 percent to $14.9 billion in 2019 and break $40 billion by 2024. In 2018, the FDA approved GW Pharmaceutical’s Epidiolex and passed the 2018 Farm Bill legalizing industrial hemp cultivation in the United States. These decisions being made at the federal level put pharmacies and general retailers in the business of selling CBD-based products in all 50 states. In the U.S. alone, Arcview and BDS researchers noted that sales of CBD products in all channels will hit $20 billion by 2024.
 
CBD, one of over 80 active cannabinoid chemicals found in cannabis, is the major non-psychoactive component of the plant Cannabis sativa L.; and is proving to be an effective treatment for a number of health conditions affecting adults, children and pets. While U.S. companies cannot legally make medical claims about CBD or its uses, there are countless scientific research studies showing potential therapeutic indications for CBD, demonstrating that it works well with body cells to improve immunity and is even produced naturally in the human brain.
 
According to a 2013 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, CBD benefits include acting in some experimental models as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antioxidant, antiemetic, anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent; and CBD is therefore a potential medicinal treatment for neuroinflammation, epilepsy, oxidative injury, vomiting and nausea, anxiety and schizophrenia. Moreover, there have been dozens of other peer-reviewed studies suggesting that CBD may have therapeutic value for medical indications including bipolar disorder, cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Huntington’s Disease, Crohn’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s Disease, PTSD, rheumatoid arthritis and Tourette’s Syndrome.
 
Due to the growing body of published research supporting the promising therapeutic benefits of CBD, the demand for CBD products has been increasing rapidly. Consequently, there has been a steady stream of new CBD products being sold online and in smoke shops, drugstore, grocery and pet care aisles. Interest in the hemp-derived compound has been further fueled by the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalized domestic hemp production in December 2018, and is now impacting industries as diverse as cosmetics, food and beverage and pharmaceuticals. Mainstream retailers, including Walgreens, Sprout, CVS, Ulta Beauty, GNC Holdings and Urban Outfitters, among many others, are now offering or looking to offer CBD products to consumers.
 
Introductory Product Line
 
Generally speaking, our management believes most CBD products for oral consumption available on the market have an earthy, bitter taste that some observers suggest is reminiscent of chlorophyll. The centerpiece of our introductory retail product line is our great-tasting, flavor-infused tinctures, formulated using only premium, organic ingredients. In addition, we will also market CBD extract in capsule form. As our Company matures, we expect to expand our proprietary CBD products to include a much broader range of flavors and form factors. Launched in late summer 2018, our official market debut showcased the following introductory products:

● | Manuka Honey CBD Tincture: 1000 mg of all-natural, pure hemp-derived CBD extract infused with raw, organic, UMF16+ Manuka Honey – available in a 60ml tincture; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lemon Lime CBD Tincture for Sport: 1500 mg of all-natural, pure hemp-derived CBD extract –available in 60ml tincture; 
● | Bacon CBD Tincture for Pets: 500 mg of all-natural, smoked bacon-flavored, pure hemp-derived CBD extract – available in 2 fluid ounce tincture with convenient spray top for dosing on pet food; and 
● | CBD Gelcaps: 1500 mg of all-natural, pure hemp-derived CBD extract in gelcap form – containing 30 gelcaps with 50 mg each.

Supply, Manufacturing and Logistics
 
Our management believes that some companies operating in the CBD oil industry tend to emphasize sales and quantity over quality and safety. Over the past several years, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) has issued several warning letters to firms that market unapproved new drugs that allegedly contain CBD. As part of these actions, the FDA has tested the chemical content of cannabinoid compounds in some of the products, and many were found to not contain the levels of CBD they claimed to contain – several were found to have no CBD.
 
All of our flavor-infused tinctures and capsules are formulated using pure, all natural, zero-THC phytocannabinoid-rich (“PCR”) hemp-derived CBD sourced from one of the largest, fully and vertically integrated producers of PCR hemp oil. All CBD isolates and oils are authenticated by an independent third party via issuance of a Certificate of Analysis (“COA”), which cannabinoid content and profile, microbiological content, heavy metal content, pesticide content, and residual solvent content. We recognize the importance of compliance and is partnered with one of the industry’s leading CGMP certified extraction facilities. This ensures the consistency and quality of our product line and brand.
 
Through its proprietary engineering process, our American-based supplier isolates and removes any unwanted compounds – while creating the maximum potency level of phytocannabinoids and terpenes – cold, enclosed and continuous manufacturing processes prevents the degradation of natural molecules during extraction and purification. Made and derived from non-GMO, USA-grown hemp, its PCR hemp oil and isolate powder are subjected to a rigorous testing system – both in-house and verified through independent, third party labs – which ensures accurate levels of phytocannabinoids and confirms the absence of THC. Our products contain only the highest level of naturally derived CBD, more than 99.5% pure, and never contain any THC.
 
We believe that a key differentiator of our finished products is the superb quality of ingredients we source from the industry’s leading suppliers, each of whom we have carefully vetted and qualified.
 
For instance, raw Mānuka honey used in our products is imported directly from the north island of New Zealand from a supplier which has been supplying quality bee products since 1974. Mānuka honey is believed to be one of the most unique and beneficial forms of honey in the world and may carry the industry’s highest UMF®16+ rating, distinguishing it as superior high-grade Manuka. Produced by bees that pollinate the native Manuka bush, possible Mānuka honey uses range from healing sore throats and digestive illnesses to curing Staph infections and gingivitis. All other flavorings infused in our products – including our all-natural, organic lemon lime flavor used in our Bespoke Sport offering -- are also sourced from reputable suppliers.
 
Fulfillment of orders from our online customers is managed by a well-established third-party logistics partner.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently sell our products through our website.
 
Management believes that the traditional retail environment is currently experiencing notable economic instability due largely to the global shift in consumer purchasing behaviors – with online shopping/ecommerce sites rapidly overtaking brick-and-mortar stores as consumer preferred shopping venues. In view of this retailing reality, we have adopted a Direct-to-Consumer sales model that is anchored by an ecommerce website whereby we educate, sell, and ship our CBD products directly to consumers. In addition, we also plan to market our CBD products on a wholesale basis to select specialty retailers, dispensaries and physicians.
 
Our marketing initiatives include the use of social marketing, social influence marketing, direct response marketing, inbound marketing, email marketing, Search Engine Optimization (“SEO”) and content marketing, among other proven strategies to generate and convert sales prospects into loyal, satisfied customers. We will also explore utilizing coupon and deal sites to drive traffic to our website and retailers, as well as participate in select industry conferences to promote our brand and build greater awareness of our products among prospective business partners and consumers.

The Difference Between Hemp and Marijuana
 
Both marijuana and hemp come from the same species of plant called “Cannabis Sativa L.” However, cultivators of the cannabis plant have manipulated it over the years to encourage specific traits to become dominant. Cannabis plants contain unique compounds called cannabinoids. Current research has revealed over 80 different cannabinoids thus far, but management believes THC is the most well-known and is credited with causing the marijuana high. While marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, hemp contains very little of the psychoactive chemical. The foregoing is one of the differences which distinguishes hemp from marijuana. 
 
Hemp was originally cultivated nearly 10,000 years ago in what is modern day Taiwan. Ancient cultivators of the cannabis plant recognized that it was dioecious, meaning that it had dual characteristics. Cultivators grew one variety of the cannabis plant to be tall and durable. This became what we now call industrial hemp. Upon discovering that the flower buds of the cannabis plant had psychoactive effects, cultivators began separating the hemp plants from the flowering plants in order to isolate their “medicinal” characteristics.
 
Scientifically, we now know that industrial hemp plants tend to produce high levels of the cannabinoid CBD, while producing low amounts of THC. Conversely, the marijuana plant produces high THC levels and low CBD levels. This chemical difference dictates the way we use the cannabis plant for medicinal and dietary supplemental purposes.
 
Federal Legislative Overview
 
Cannabidiol, or CBD, that is derived from industrial hemp plants — like the CBD used in all products currently being produced or to be produced by Bespoke Extracts — is deemed by the FDA to be a dietary supplement, not a medication. Consequently, in the U.S., no prescription is required to obtain CBD and it can be legally purchased and consumed in all 50 states (and in 40 countries around the world).
 
In December 2018 with the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill, industrial hemp is now recognized as an agricultural commodity, such as corn, wheat or soybeans. Historically, hemp was an underpinning of American agriculture from the 17th century through the early 1900’s. This recent change in modern policy is expected to restore the legacy of American hemp production as a prolific and highly sustainable crop staple. In fact, according to research firm Frontier Data’s Global State of Hemp: 2019 Industry Outlook, 2018 sales of hemp worldwide were driven by continued strength in Chinese textiles, European industrials, Canadian foods and the U.S. hemp-derived CBD market. However, continued demand in the CBD market “will be the main driving force behind the global hemp market’s continued growth,” which the firm estimates will reach $5.7 billion by 2020.

Competitive Overview
 
Given the rapid growth of the U.S. CBD oil industry, hundreds of companies have entered the market. Consequently, the market is becoming highly competitive and we believe to compete in the market requires ensuring the quality and integrity of product offerings. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial, distribution, and marketing resources, as well as greater brand awareness than us, and there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully compete.
