ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------


 
  Lode-Star Mining Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 9, 2004 for the purpose of acquiring and exploring mineral properties.  Our principal executive offices are in Reno, Nevada. We also maintain a business office in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
  
  We have no revenues, have losses since inception, and have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditor. We are relying upon loans and the sale of securities to fund our operations. We have no employees and expect to use outside consultants, advisors, attorneys and accountants as necessary for the next twelve months.
  
  Mineral Property Interest
  
  Further to a Mineral Option Agreement (the “Option Agreement”) dated October 4, 2014, on December 5, 2014, we entered into a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with Lode-Star Gold INC., a private Nevada corporation (“LSG”) in which we agreed to issue 35,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $230,180, to LSG in exchange for an initial 20% undivided beneficial interest in and to LSG’s Goldfield property (the “Acquisition”), which made LSG our largest and controlling shareholder.
  
  LSG’s Goldfield Bonanza property is comprised of 31 patented mineral claims owned 100% by LSG, located on approximately 460 acres in the district of Goldfield in the state of Nevada (the “Property”). The Property is clear titled, with a 1% Net Smelter Royalty (“NSR”) existing in the favor of the original property owner. LSG has rehabbed approximately 1/2 mile of drift at the 300ft level and completed 22 surface core drill holes for a total of 10,400ft and 152 underground core drill holes for a total of 23,000ft.
  
  The execution of the Subscription Agreement was one of the closing conditions of the Option Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired the sole and exclusive option to earn up to an 80% undivided interest in and to the Property. To earn the additional 60% interest in the Property, we are required to fund all expenditures on the Property and pay LSG an aggregate of $5 million in cash from the Property’s mineral production proceeds in the form of an NSR. Until we have earned the additional 60% interest, the NSR will be split 79.2% to LSG, 19.8% to us and 1% to the former Property owner.
  
  The Option Agreement can be found as Exhibit 10.1 to our report filed on Form 8-K on October 9, 2014 and is incorporated by reference, shown as Exhibit 10.5 to this report. The Subscription Agreement can be found as Exhibit 10.7 to our report filed on Form 10-K/A on January 11, 2017 and is incorporated by reference, shown as Exhibit 10.7 to this report.
  
  If we fail to make any cash payments to LSG within one year of October 4, 2014, we are required to pay LSG an additional $100,000, and in any subsequent years in which we fail to complete the payment of the entire $5 million described above, we must make quarterly cash payments to LSG of $25,000 until we have earned the additional 60% interest in the Property.
  
  LSG granted us a series of deferrals of the payments, with the most recent being granted on January 11, 2017. LSG agreed on that date to defer payment of all amounts due in accordance with the Option Agreement until further notice. On January 17, 2017, the Company and LSG agreed that as of January 1, 2017, all outstanding balances shall carry a compound interest rate of 5% per annum. It was further agreed that the ongoing payment deferral shall apply to interest and principal.
  
  We agreed with LSG that upon the successful completion of a toll milling agreement after permitting is achieved, there will be a basis to form a joint management committee to outline work programs and budgets, as contemplated in the Option Agreement and for us to act as the operator of the Property. To the date of this report, no work programs have been approved and LSG has borne all costs in connection with operations on the Property. We expect the first work program, entailing Property-related costs for which we will be responsible, to be approved in 2019.
  
  Lode-Star Gold INC. (“LSG”)
  
  LSG, our controlling shareholder, was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 13, 1998 for the purpose of acquiring exploration stage mineral properties.  It currently has one shareholder, Lonnie Humphries, who is the spouse of Mark Walmesley, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Walmesley is also the Director of Operations and a director of LSG.
  
  LSG acquired the leases to the Property in 1997 and became the registered and beneficial owner of the Property on September 19, 2009. Since the earlier of those dates, it has conducted contract exploration work on the Property but has not determined whether it contains mineral reserves that are economically recoverable. LSG is an exploration stage company and has not generated any revenues since its inception. The Property represents its only material asset.
