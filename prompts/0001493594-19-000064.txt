ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We design and manufacture semiconductor products for Data Center, Telecommunications ("Telecom") and Industrial and Defense ("I&D") applications. Headquartered in Lowell, Massachusetts, we have more than 65 years of application expertise, with silicon, gallium arsenide ("GaAs") and indium phosphide ("InP") fabrication, manufacturing, assembly and test, and operational facilities throughout North America, Europe and Asia. We design, develop and manufacture differentiated, high-value semiconductor products for customers who demand high performance, quality and reliability. We offer a broad portfolio of thousands of standard and custom devices, which include integrated circuits ("IC"), multi-chip modules ("MCM"), diodes, amplifiers, switches and switch limiters, passive and active components and complete subsystems, across dozens of product lines serving over 8,000 end customers in three primary markets. Our semiconductor products are electronic components that our customers incorporate into their larger electronic systems, such as wireless basestations, high speed optical networks, active antenna arrays, radar, medical systems and test and measurement. Our primary markets are: (1) Telecom, which includes carrier infrastructure like long-haul/metro, 5G and fiber-to-the-X ("FTTx")/ passive optical network ("PON"); (2) Data Centers, enabled by our broad portfolio of analog ICs and photonic components for high speed optical module customers; and (3) I&D, which includes military and commercial radar, radio frequency ("RF") jammers, electronic countermeasures, communication data links, satellite communications and multi-market applications, which include industrial, medical, test and measurement as well as scientific applications. 
Many of our products have long life cycles ranging from five to ten years, and some of our products have been generating revenue for over twenty years. We continue to develop new products and technologies to improve our ability to serve our primary markets. Our growth strategy is focused on strengthening our customer relationships and capturing more design wins in order to increase our market share. As we grow our portfolio and technology base, we believe our customers will select more of our components for use in their systems.
Our manufacturing model consists of domestic semiconductor wafer fabrication capabilities coupled with our external foundry partners. This provides us with a competitive advantage and an attractive financial model by allowing us to utilize our variable cost structure while enabling us to adapt to changing market conditions and customer demands. We operate semiconductor fabrication facilities at our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters and in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Our facilities are certified to the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 9001 international quality standard and ISO14001 environmental management standard. We manufacture compound semiconductors including GaAs and InP. In the I&D markets, a domestic fabrication facility may be a requirement to be a strategic supplier, and we believe our status as a “Trusted Foundry” offers us further competitive differentiation.
We also utilize external semiconductor foundries to supply us with additional capacity, lower costs and to provide us access to additional process technologies. The ability to utilize a broad array of internal proprietary process technologies and commercially available foundry technologies allows us to select the most appropriate technology to solve our customers’ needs. We believe that this strategy provides us with dependable supply, control over quality, reduced capital investment requirements, faster time to market and additional outsourced capacity when needed. In addition, the experience base cultivated through the continued operation of our internal fabrication lines provides us with the expertise to better manage our external foundry suppliers.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are directed toward the rapid development of new and innovative products, process technologies and packaging techniques. The interaction of semiconductor process technology, circuit design technology and packaging technology defines the performance parameters and the customers’ acceptance of our products. We believe some of our core competencies are the ability to model, design, test, integrate, package and manufacture differentiated solutions for our customers. We leverage this core competency to solve difficult and complex challenges that our customers face during their system design phases. We believe our integrated and customized solutions offer customers high performance, quality, reliability and faster time to market.
Circuit design and device modeling expertise. Our engineers are experts in the design of circuits capable of reliable, high-performance analog RF, microwave, millimeterwave and photonic signal conditioning. Our staff has decades of experience in solving complex design challenges in applications involving high frequency, high power and environmentally-rugged operating conditions. 
Semiconductor process technology. We leverage our domestic semiconductor wafer fabrication capabilities and our foundry suppliers to offer customers the right process technology to meet their particular requirements. Depending on the requirements for the application, our semiconductor products may be designed using an internally developed or externally sourced process technology.
Packaging expertise. Our extensive packaging expertise enables us to model the interaction between the semiconductor and its package. Our engineers make adjustments in the design of both the semiconductor and the package, to take account of that interaction. We offer products in a variety of different package types for specific applications, including plastic over-molded, ceramic and laminate-based packaging.
We continue to invest in proprietary processes to enable us to develop and manufacture high-value solutions. For example, we have developed innovative, patented technologies such as heterolithic microwave integrated circuit ("HMIC"), which provides high integration, high power and low loss switching capabilities for our primary markets. This technology replaces mechanical switches for very high-power applications such as wireless basestations.
Our engineers’ radar, optical, microwave and millimeterwave system-level design expertise allows us to offer differentiated solutions that leverage multiple process technologies and are integrated into a single, higher-level assembly, thereby delivering our customers enhanced functionality.
Our Markets & Products
Our core strategy is to develop and innovate high-performance products that address our customers’ technical challenges in our primary markets: Telecom, Data Center and I&D. While sales in any or all of our primary markets may slow or decline from period to period, over the long-term we generally expect to benefit from our strength in these markets. We expect our revenue in the Telecom market to be driven by 5G, with continued upgrades and expansion of communications equipment to support mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablets, increasing adoption of bandwidth rich services. We expect our revenue in the Data Center market to be driven by the adoption of cloud-based components and the migration to an application centric architecture, which we expect will drive adoption of higher speed, 100G and higher speed optical and photonic wireless links. We expect our revenue in the I&D market to be driven by the broad product portfolio we offer that services applications such as test and measurement, satellite communications, civil and military radar, industrial, scientific and medical applications. Growth in this market is subject to changes in governmental programs and budget funding, which is difficult to predict. We expect revenue in this market to be further supported by growth in applications for our multi-market catalog products.
Telecom. Growth in the Telecom market is driven by the proliferation of wireless and wired devices from smartphones and tablets to basestations, as well as the data rich applications and services they enable such as mobile Internet, cloud computing, video-on-demand, social media, global positioning functionality and location-based services. Growth in global next-generation Internet and Internet of Things ("IoT") applications drives demand for communications infrastructure equipment requiring amplifiers, filters, receivers, switches, synthesizers, transformers, upconverters and other components to expand and upgrade cellular backhaul, cellular infrastructure, wired broadband and fiber optic networks. Semiconductor products and solutions must continually deliver greater bandwidth and functionality as the demands of our customers and end users increase.
Our expertise in system-level architectures and advanced IC design capability allow us to offer network original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") customers highly-integrated solutions optimized for performance and cost. Our portfolio of opto-electronics products includes lasers, clock and data recovery, optical post amplifiers, laser and modulator drivers, transimpedance amplifiers, transmitter and receiver applications in 2.5/10/40/100 gigabits per second ("Gbps") long haul, metro, data center links and fiber-to-the-X ("FTTx") fiber optic network components that enable telecommunications carriers and data centers to cost-efficiently increase their network capacity by a factor of four to ten times over earlier generation solutions. We match our opto-electronic components to various lasers enabling our customers to buy more complete solutions for their opto-electronic systems. For optical communications applications, we utilize a proprietary combination of GaAs, InP and Silicon Germanium ("SiGe") technologies to obtain advantages in performance and size. For wired broadband applications, we offer OEM customers the opportunity to streamline their supply chain through our broad catalog of active components such as active splitters, amplifiers, multi-function ICs and switches, as well as passive components such as transformers, diplexers, filters, power dividers and combiners.
Data Center. The demand by Cloud Data Center providers for faster data delivery speeds at cost-effective prices is growing rapidly, where higher speeds are necessary to process the current growth in traffic. To solve these challenges, we leverage our broad optical and photonic portfolio of products to enable our customers to deliver optical transceivers that meet the requirements of today’s Cloud Data Center deployments. By building a comprehensive portfolio of complementary products that enable our customers’ optical transceiver applications, we offer high performing, cost-effective component solutions for next-generation networks.
We enable the market with a complete product portfolio of PAM-4 PHYs, TIAs, Modulator Drivers, Lasers, and Silicon Photonics, and, in some cases, individual component designs are optimized for use together as a chip-set.
Industrial & Defense. In the I&D market, military applications require advanced electronic systems, such as radar warning receivers, communications data links and tactical radios, unmanned aerial vehicles ("UAVs"), RF jammers, electronic countermeasures and smart munitions. Military applications are becoming more sophisticated, favoring higher performance semiconductor ICs based on GaAs and Gallium Nitride ("GaN") technologies due to their high power density, improved power efficiency and broadband capability. 
We believe our in-depth knowledge of critical radar system requirements, integration expertise and track record of reliability make us a valued resource for our I&D customers faced with demanding application parameters. Further, we have been accredited by the United States Department of Defense with “Trusted Foundry” status, a designation conferred on microelectronics vendors exhibiting the highest levels of process integrity and protection, which we believe differentiates us as a trusted manufacturer of ICs for U.S. military and aerospace applications. For radar applications, we offer standard and custom amplifiers, discrete components, switch limiters, phase shifters and integrated modules for transmit and receive functions in air traffic control, marine, weather, and military radar applications. For military communications data link and tactical radio applications, we offer a family of active, passive and discrete products, such as 
Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits ("MMICs"), control components, voltage-controlled oscillators ("VCOs"), transformers, power pallets, amplifiers and diodes. In some cases, we design parts specifically for these applications, while in others, our reputation for quality and our broad catalog allows these demanding customers to reduce the cost of their high-performance systems by designing in standard dual-use or commercial off-the-shelf parts that we have developed for other applications. We believe manufacturing many of these products in our Lowell, Massachusetts Trusted Foundry offers us a competitive advantage in the I&D market because of certain I&D customers’ requirements for a domestic supply chain.
Furthermore, growth in the I&D business is driven by multi-market applications encompassing industrial, medical, test and measurement and scientific applications, where analog RF, microwave and millimeterwave semiconductor solutions are gaining prevalence. In addition, evolving medical technology has increased the need for high-performance MMICs and other semiconductor solutions in medical imaging and patient monitoring to provide enhanced analysis and functionality.
In the medical industry, our custom designed non-magnetic diode product line is a critical component for certain MRI applications. For sensing and test and measurement applications, we believe our patented HMIC process is ideal for high-performance, integrated bias networks and switches. Our catalog of general purpose GaAs ICs includes low noise amplifiers, switches and power amplifiers that address a wide range of applications such as industrial automation systems to test and measurement equipment.
To address our primary markets, we offer a broad range of standard and custom ICs and components. Our product catalog currently consists of thousands of products including the following key product platforms: amplifiers, ICs, diodes, switches and switch limiters, passive and active components and multi-chip modules. Many of our product platforms are leveraged across multiple markets and applications. For example, our application expertise with regard to power amplifier technology is leveraged across both scientific laboratory equipment applications and commercial and defense radar system applications. Our diode technology is used in switch filter banks of military tactical radios as well as medical imaging MRI systems. The table below presents the major product families and major applications in our primary markets.

Sales and Marketing
We employ a global multi-channel sales strategy and support model intended to facilitate our customers’ evaluations and selections of our products. We sell through our direct sales force, our application engineering staff, our global network of independent sales representatives, resellers and distributors. We have strategically positioned our direct sales and applications engineering staff in locations worldwide, augmented by independent sales representatives and distributors with additional domestic and foreign locations to offer responsive local support resources to our customers and to build long-term relationships. Our application engineers visit customers at their engineering and manufacturing facilities, aid them in understanding our capabilities and collaborate with them to deliver products that can optimize their system performance. Our global independent sales representatives and distributor network allow us to extend our sales capabilities to new customers in new geographies more cost effectively than using our direct sales force alone.
Our products are principally sold in North America, Asia and Europe, which is where we concentrate our direct sales force, application engineering staff, independent sales representatives and distributors. Sales to our distributors accounted for 33.3%, 29.0% and 19.3% of our revenue in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our agreements with sales representatives, resellers and distributors may provide for an initial term of one or more years with the opportunity for subsequent renewals or for an indefinite term, and also typically provide that either party may terminate the agreement for convenience with a minimum period of prior notice to the other party, usually between 30 and 90 days.
Our sales efforts are focused on the needs of our customers in our three primary markets rather than on particular product lines, facilitating product cross-selling across end markets, and within key accounts. Through our website, customers can inquire about our products, request samples and access our product selection guides, detailed product brochures and data sheets, application notes, suggested design block diagrams and test fixture information, technical articles and information regarding quality and reliability.
Customers
Our customer base is diversified and includes OEM customers, contract manufacturers, resellers and distributors. For fiscal years 2019 and 2018, no direct customer individually accounted for 10% or more of our revenue. For fiscal year 2017, one direct customer, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. ("Huawei") accounted for 10% of our revenue. In addition, our principal distributor, Richardson Electronics, an Arrow Electronics Company ("Richardson"), accounted for 16.1%, 12.5% and 10.5% of our revenue in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our top 25 direct customers accounted for an aggregate of 47.5%, 52.8% and 59.1% of our revenue in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our orders from and sales to customers in the telecommunications infrastructure and networking markets may tend to be lower in our first fiscal quarter as compared to other quarters due to seasonal inventory management by large OEM and contract manufacturing customers. 
Competition
The markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by continuously evolving customer requirements. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include:

▪ | the ability to timely design and deliver products and solutions that meet customers’ performance, reliability and price requirements;


▪ | the breadth and diversity of product offerings;


▪ | the ability to provide a reliable supply of products in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner;


▪ | the ability of engineering talent to drive innovation and new product development;


▪ | the quality of customer service and technical support; and


▪ | the financial reliability, operational stability and reputation of the supplier.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We compete primarily with both our customers' internal design resources and other suppliers of high-performance analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline RF, microwave, millimeterwave and photonic applications, some of whom have greater financial resources and scale than us. We expect competition in our markets to intensify, as new competitors enter these markets, existing competitors merge or form alliances and new technologies emerge. We believe that in the future there will be increased competition from companies utilizing alternative technologies, including high-volume manufacturers using low-cost silicon process technology. Some of our competitors are also our customers, and in certain product categories we compete with semiconductor manufacturers from which we also obtain foundry services, such as Sumitomo Electric Device Innovations, Inc.
We compete with Broadcom Inc. ("Broadcom") across our primary markets, Telecom, Data Center and I&D. In the Telecom and Data Center markets, we compete with NXP Semiconductors N.V. ("NXP"), Wolfspeed, Inphi Corporation ("Inphi"), Maxlinear Inc. ("Maxlinear") and Semtech Corporation ("Semtech"). In the I&D market, we compete with Analog Devices, Inc. ("ADI"), Microchip Technology Incorporated ("Microchip"), Qorvo, Inc. ("Qorvo") and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. ("Skyworks").
Backlog and Inventory
Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term contracts where the customer commits to buy any minimum amount of product over an extended period. On occasion, we ship finished goods inventory to certain customer or third-party “hub” locations, but do not recognize revenue associated with such shipments until these customers consume the inventory from the hub. We also frequently ship products from our inventory shortly after receipt of an order, which we refer to as “turns business”. A substantial portion of our revenues for any particular fiscal quarter may be derived from turns business transacted in the last few weeks of the quarter, and unanticipated fluctuations in turns business may result in material shifts in revenue between fiscal quarters. Due to the foregoing factors, different ordering patterns of our customers and the wide range of lead times to produce and deliver our products, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. 
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants.
 As of September 27, 2019, we had 684 U.S. and 148 foreign issued patents and 88 U.S. and 142 foreign pending patent applications covering elements of circuit design, manufacturing and wafer fabrication. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2019 to 2038. We do not regard any of the patents scheduled to expire in the next twelve months as material to our overall intellectual property portfolio. Notwithstanding our active pursuit of patent protection when available, we believe that our future success will be determined by the innovation, technical expertise and management abilities of our engineers and management more than by patent ownership.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which may in the future require that we defend those claims and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages or settlement amounts, expend resources to develop non-infringing technology, seek a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other intellectual property rights. 
Manufacturing, Sources of Supply and Raw Materials
When designing a product solution for our customers, we may choose to utilize our internal proprietary process technologies or technologies from external fabrication facilities, or a combination of both. We believe our ability to select both internal and external technologies in our product solutions is a competitive advantage because it helps us to provide a unique and optimized solution for our customers. 
Our internal wafer fabrication and the majority of our internal assembly and test operations are conducted at our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters. We believe having U.S.-based wafer fabrication is a competitive advantage for us over competitors that do not have this capability, because it provides us with greater control over quality, a secure source of supply and a domestic source for U.S. I&D customers. We also believe that our U.S.-based wafer fabrication facilitates shorter time to market for both new and existing products, shorter production lead times than if we utilized external foundries and allow us to efficiently produce a wide range of low, medium and high volume products. We perform internal assembly and test functions at our Lowell, Massachusetts, Nashua, New Hampshire, Ann Arbor, Michigan and Hsinchu, Taiwan locations.
We complement our internal manufacturing with outsourced foundry partners and other suppliers. Our operations team has extensive expertise in the management of outsourced manufacturing service providers and other supply chain participants. We believe our fab-lite model of outsourcing certain of our manufacturing activities rather than investing heavily in capital-intensive production facilities, provides us with the flexibility to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies our operations, provides access to other process technologies and additional manufacturing capacity and reduces our capital requirements. We also use third-party contract manufacturers for assembly, packaging and test functions, and in some cases for fully-outsourced turnkey manufacturing of our products.
The principal materials used in the production of our IC products are high purity source materials such as gallium, aluminum, arsenic, nitrite, carbon and silicon. We purchase from hundreds of suppliers worldwide, a wide variety of semiconductors, wafers, packages, metals, printed circuit boards, electromechanical components and other materials for use in our operations. These supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis. The use of external suppliers involves a number of risks, including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and components, and the lack of control over delivery schedules, capacity, quality and costs.
While we attempt to maintain alternative sources for our principal raw materials to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases, some of the raw materials and components are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique nature, design or the length of time necessary for re-design or qualification. We routinely utilize single sources of supply for various materials based on availability, performance, efficiency or cost considerations. For example, wafers procured from merchant foundries for a particular process technology are generally sourced through a single foundry on which we rely for all of our wafers in that process. Our reliance on external suppliers puts us at risk of supply chain disruption if a supplier does not have sufficient raw material inventory to meet our manufacturing needs, goes out of business, changes or discontinues the process in which components or wafers are manufactured or declines to continue supplying us for competitive or other reasons, as discussed in more detail in “Item 1A. “Risk Factors” herein. Where practical, we attempt to mitigate these risks by qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesigning products for alternative components and purchasing incremental inventory of raw materials and components in order to protect us against supply disruptions.

Quality Assurance
The goal of our quality assurance program is for our products to meet our customers’ requirements, be delivered on time, and function reliably throughout their useful lives. The ISO provides models for quality assurance for various operational disciplines, such as design, manufacturing, and testing, which comprise part of our overall quality management system. Our following locations have each received ISO 9001:2015 certifications in one or more of their principal functional areas: Lowell, Massachusetts; Cork, Ireland; Ithaca, New York; Santa Clara and Newport Beach, California; Morrisville, North Carolina; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Nashua, New Hampshire; and Hsinchu, Taiwan. In addition, our Lowell, Massachusetts facility has received an ISO 14001:2015 environmental management systems certification.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment in the U.S. and other countries. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants into the air, water and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and, requirements regarding the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. While we are committed to compliance with applicable regulations, the risk of environmental liabilities can never be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur material future expenditures.
We are also regulated under a number of federal, state and local laws regarding responsible sourcing, recycling, product packaging and product content requirements in the U.S. and other countries, including legislation enacted in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions that have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging. These laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur material expenditures or otherwise cause financial harm.
Export Regulations
We market and sell our products both inside and outside the U.S. Certain products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS"), which require that we obtain an export license before we can export certain controlled products or technology to specified countries. Additionally, some of our products are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which restrict the export of information and material that may be used for military or intelligence applications by a foreign person. Similar controls exist in other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws could result in sanctions by the government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from government contracts. We maintain an export compliance program staffed by dedicated personnel under which we screen export transactions against current lists of restricted exports, destinations and end users with the objective of managing export-related decisions, transactions and shipping logistics to ensure compliance with these requirements.
Employees
As of September 27, 2019, we employed approximately 1,100 individuals worldwide. None of our domestic employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement; however, as of September 27, 2019, approximately 15 of our employees working in certain European locations were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with employees to generally be good and we have not experienced a work stoppage due to labor issues.
History and Recent Developments
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in March 2009. Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries, which are organized and operated according to the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation.
MACOM Technology Solutions Inc., our primary operating subsidiary, which provides high-performance analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline applications across the RF, microwave, millimeterwave and lightwave spectrum, was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on July 16, 2008. MACOM Technology Solutions Limited, our primary foreign operating subsidiary, was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on November 18, 2008. The heritage of some of our business operations date back over 65 years to the founding of Microwave Associates, Inc. and the MACOM brand dates back over 30 years.
We completed acquisitions and divestitures during fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to attempt to further align our businesses to our primary markets. Those transactions include:
In January 2017, we acquired Applied Micro Circuits Corporation ("AppliedMicro"), a global provider of silicon solutions for next-generation cloud infrastructure and Cloud Data Centers, as well as connectivity products for edge, metro and long-haul communications 
equipment (the "AppliedMicro Acquisition"). We acquired AppliedMicro in order to expand our business in enterprise and Cloud Data Center applications.
In connection with the acquisition of AppliedMicro, we announced a plan to divest their Compute business (the "Compute business"). On October 27, 2017, we sold the Compute business and received an equity interest in the buyer.
In fiscal year 2017, we completed the acquisitions of Triple Play Communications Corporation ("TPC"), Antario Technologies ("Antario") and Picometrix LLC ("Picometrix") in order to further expand our design center capabilities and expand our business in enterprise and Cloud Data Center applications.
In May 2018, we divested our long-range optical subassembly product line that we had acquired through our December 2015 acquisition of FiBest Limited ("LR4 business"). The LR4 business did not meet our expectations for profitable growth.
Our acquisition strategy is intended to accelerate our revenue growth, expand our technology portfolio, grow our addressable market and create shareholder value.
