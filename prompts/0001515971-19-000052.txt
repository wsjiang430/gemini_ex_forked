Item 1. Business
Overview

We intend to provide capital directly to borrowers seeking financing for commercial real estate properties either for refinancing or acquisitions. These loans will encompass originating performing commercial first mortgage loans, subordinate financings, and other commercial real estate-related debt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we intend to operate our business so that we do not become subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Accordingly, we do not plan to primarily engage in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and we do not plan to acquire investment securities (such as the above-referenced commercial mortgage-backed securities) having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the Companys total assets.

We expect to offer financing across a broad-spectrum of asset backed and commercial real asset type collateral at all points within an assets capital property type such as office, retail, industrial, multi-family, and hospitality. Alpha Investment Inc. (Alpha Investment, ALPC, or the Company) will coordinate its lending initiatives with outside commercial real estate loan brokers, which have access to commercial real estate owners seeking financing or refinancing opportunities, and with loan origination firms that have Borrowers seeking loans. This will enable ALPC to broaden its access to new Borrowers and to develop and implement financing solutions for these other lenders, mortgage bankers, borrowers, and owners. In the event the Company uses 3rd party loan origination services and underwriters, the Company will cover these costs in accordance with industry standard fees.

Furthermore, Omega Commercial Finance Corporation, a publicly-held Wyoming corporation (Omega) can introduce financing transactions to the Company to develop and implement a Borrowers customized financing solutions. As a publicly-held financial services holding company Omega is the owner of an umbrella of diversified financial service related companies. As a holding company, Omega does not directly produce goods or services; rather Omega accomplishes these goals, seeks to generate revenue and realize shareholder value by acting as an umbrella holding company to a portfolio of various operating commercial real estate and capital market subsidiaries companies.

Alpha Investments capital resources have been limited to date, which has restricted its business activities to organizational matters, as well as planning implementation of its proposed business. Alpha Investments ability to implement that plan will be subject to raising significant capital, primarily from the proceeds of the sales of Securities pursuant to its registration statement on Form S-1 declared effective on August 2, 2018 (Direct Offering).

Corporate History

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 22, 2013, to develop, create, manufacture and market, toys for small children which would be designed to attach to car seats and amuse and entertain children during a drive, without distracting the attention of the driver. The Company, however, encountered significant constraints in raising sufficient capital to fully implement its business plan.

On March 17, 2017, Omega purchased 35,550,000 outstanding shares of the Companys common stock in the Control Share Sale from Malcolm Hargrave (35,000,000 shares), DTH International Corporation (500,000 shares) and Lisa Foster (50,000 shares) for aggregate consideration of $295,000. The Control Share Sale was consummated in a private transaction pursuant to a common stock purchase agreement entered between Omega and Mr. Hargrave, acting individually and on behalf of the other selling stockholders. Upon completion of the Control Share Sale, a Change in Control of the Company took place and in connection therewith, Mr. Hargrave resigned as our sole director and officer and Omega, as the new majority stockholder of the Company, elected Timothy R. Fussell, Ph.D. as President, Chairman of the Board and a director and Todd C. Buxton, Omegas Chief Executive Officer, as Chief Executive Officer, Vice Chairman of the Board and a director.

In addition to the foregoing, new management elected to focus the shift in the Companys business focus to real estate and other commercial lending, which they believed offered better opportunities for shareholder growth. In connection therewith, on March 30, 2017, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State changing our name from Gogo Baby, Inc. to Alpha Investment Inc. to better reflect our new business plan. The name change and a corresponding change in the Companys OTC markets trading symbol from GGBY to ALPC received approval from FINRA and became effective as of April 19, 2017.

Plan of Operations

Our core objective will be to achieve advantageous yields and consistent interest income on short and medium term loans (Loans) by:


 furnishing capital to our affiliated lenders to make Loans through their correspondent platforms primarily to borrowers such as commercial real estate developers and speculators, business owners, landlords and owners of core assets when traditional financing is unavailable to such borrowers for acquisitions, refinancing of commercial property loans and other asset backed transactions; and


 making Loans directly to small businesses in the commercial real estate and other asset-backed markets.

Either directly or in conjunction with our affiliated lenders, we plan to consult on various financing programs with an emphasis on Loans secured by commercial real estate, including office buildings, multi-family residences, shopping centers, industrial, and hotels, as well as asset backed Loans secured by account receivables from established companies. Loans may consist of senior debt loans, mezzanine or subordinated loans, preferred equity and other equity participation financing structures, and in the case of specialty financing, for the factoring of receivables secured by a Uniform Commercial Code security interest.

We intend to follow a conservative lending profile for the Loans we fund. Our strategy is to seek low leveraged first lien senior debt mortgage loans and high debt service structured financing programs, as opposed to riskier, less secure, mezzanine or equity positions.

Many times when a company decides to pursue new opportunities, they find that the barriers of entry are often high or unattainable. Typically, this is due to a lack of capital and the proper advisory services and solutions necessary for these companies to achieve their business potential. We have determined to address that need by focusing our business efforts primarily for the purpose of underwriting or investing in Loans and/or specialty financing programs backed or secured by real estate or other types of related assets or equity interests.

Regardless of the type of Loan, our focus is will be earning rates of return that exceed the commensurate level of risk associated with each Loan and specialty financing program. We plan to use our and our affiliated lenders third-party relationships with seasoned providers to independently assess the value, volatility, and adequacy of the collateral for each Loan we fund, whether through our affiliated lenders or directly, to assure that all Loans made are appropriately collateralized. As part of our assurance procedures, a third party independent asset loan manager will assess the ease of repossessing and disposing of collateral for each loan. We also will ensure that underlying Loans will be adequately insured. We plan to use only third-party credit and risk assessment firms that utilize standard securitization underwriting protocols and criteria in the credit and risk assessment process, prior to final approval of any Loan.

The Company has the authority to provide our affiliated lenders with capital to or directly fund or invest in a wide variety of Loans, securities, and other real estate related investments, domestic or foreign, of all kinds and descriptions, whether publicly traded or privately placed, including but not limited to common and preferred stocks, bonds and other debt securities, direct ownership interests in real estate, interests in real estate investment funds, Loans of all kind (including the Loans herein), accounts receivable, notes, convertible securities, limited partnership interests, limited liability company interests, mutual fund shares, options, warrants, derivatives, currencies, monetary instruments and cash and cash equivalents. We will not trade in commodities or financial futures.

Business Objectives and Strategy

Our core business objective is to achieve advantageous and consistent rates of return from short and medium term Loans to borrowers when traditional financing is unavailable to such borrowers for acquisitions, refinancing of commercial property loans and other asset backed transactions. We plan to focus on various alternative commercial real estate financings with an emphasis on Loans secured by commercial real estate and also seek to invest in financing of core real estate assets that include office buildings, multi-family residences, shopping centers, and hospitality, plus ground up entitled land developments. The Loans may consist of senior debt loans, mezzanine or subordinated loans, preferred equity and other equity participation financing structures. We intend to follow a conservative lending profile for the Loans we fund, which means low loan to value and high debt service cover ratios. Our strategy is to seek Loans that are first lien, senior debt mortgage loans and specialty financing programs, as opposed to riskier, yet much more profitable, and less secure mezzanine or equity positions.

With respect to asset backed Loans, we plan to fund, either through our affiliated lenders or directly, accounts receivable based lines of credit better known as factoring. Factoring assists small to medium sized business owners in resolving their short term working capital needs. This service will be supported by a back-office underwriting, due diligence, sales, marketing, servicing, training, and collections provider working either directly with us or with our affiliated lenders. We plan to utilize state of the art software that will allow us to facilitate and organize a seamless stream of completed transactions. Further, we plan to leverage our assets at a multiple of up to 6(x) times that will maximize our capital. We believe that this will position us to create capitalization models that offer us high yielding short term Loans as the result of the ability of this financing product to garner high returns and turnover of the deployed capital that is secured by receivables due from established companies such as a Wall Mart, GM and Best Buy,

Use of Loan Servicers

In carrying out our business strategy, we will likely utilize third-party firms that specialize in Loan origination and servicing (Servicers), either directly or through our affiliated lenders. We intend to perform due diligence on each Servicer which we, directly or indirectly, plan use in the origination and servicing of Loans, in order to evaluate the firms experience and expertise in originating and servicing Loans that satisfy our lending and investment criteria.
Use of Other Third-Party Service Providers

We, either directly or through our affiliated lenders, will utilize other third parties to provide various ancillary services, such as such as evaluation and feasibility services, closing and escrow services and fund administration services.

Sale of Participations; Co-Investments and Participations

In the discretion of management, we may sell participation rights in the Loans we originate to other entities.

We may from time to time co-invest and or syndicate participation interest in loans as the administrative agent or buying a participation interest. We plan to only employ this strategy with seasoned well-established organizations in the CRE lending industry such as private trusts, real estate financing institutions, mutual funds, pension funds, investment houses, or hedge funds of fund. We believe that this will afford the Company with an additional opportunity to participate in well-structured transactions with organizations with proven track records involving originating, underwriting, and servicing.

The Commercial Real Estate Lending Product

Operationally, management believes the market for commercial mortgage loans will offer opportunities for the deployment of capital we raise. The commercial real estate (CRE) markets have suffered greatly in recent years beginning with the 2008 U.S. financial market crisis, which resulted in a steep and prolonged recession. However, as the lending markets have steadily recovered along with market leaders such as large banks Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Capital One, believe CRE lending landscape has now stabilized in select Centralized Business Districts known as  CBDs  and afford extremely attractive opportunities for deploying capital. Thus, we will focus on positioning the Company to seize this opportunity within this market. We believe that our proposed business model is comparable to that currently being used by some of the top-level commercial real estate lender industry professionals. However, to compete and succeed within this industry, we, plan to work with our correspondent lenders in developing a proprietary pricing and lending model for the commercial real estate finance debt and equity market. If we are able to do so, as to which no assurance can be given, we believe that we will have a strategic advantage to compete in the market.

Key Operational Highlights  CRE Loans

●
 The overall core property CRE lending market is vast and global pushing well above a trillion dollars so we believe there are significant business opportunities that will afford the Company continued growth.

●
 We expect that our lending model will allow for smaller increments of loans designed for quicker closings to permit investors to monitor development of the ongoing balance sheet and enable us to more rapidly achieve milestones.

●
 Trepp.com a CMBS research firm, estimates the current size of the CMBS loan market at approximately $680 billion with $10.0 billion of underlying mortgages maturing in the near term.

●
 We plan to retain or use seasoned commercial real estate securitization in-house and independent specialists retained by our affiliated lenders to coordinate our loan underwriting model centered on mitigating loan-loss risks and to perform all other related and required third party due diligence.

●
 Since the securitization industry has standardized the underwriting criteria, we anticipate that it will allow for each third - party service provider we use to integrate and exchange information effectively and efficiently.

●
 We believe that we will have low cost and prudent leverage available to us to fund loans originated or made either through our affiliated lenders or directly.

●
 We intend to utilize our own internal industry knowledge as well as our affiliated lenders significant loan origination, structuring, and closing experience to serve our needs to generate revenues.

●
 Our strategy has been developed with the input of experienced industry veterans.


The Commercial Real Estate Market Forecast

●
 Capital Markets: The next three years will likely see cap rates flat at best or rising, which we expect will outstrip property income growth. The economys performance over the period will determine whether commercial real estate values continue to rise mildly, remain relatively flat or decline mildly or moderately.

●
 Office: U.S. office market growth should continue in 2018, but at a slower pace, due to higher completions and the tight labor markets impact on tenant demand.

●
 Occupier: Labor remains the primary challenge facing corporations. Even as they lower their space requirements, many occupiers are reinventing or adapting their workplace standards to meet employee demand for amenity-focused, flexible, technology-driven work environments.

●
 Industrial & Logistics: Although we are well along in the economic cycle, in the e-commerce/omnichannel cycle we are not, so demand for high-quality, well-located industrial real estate should not wane anytime soon. In most markets, a lack of quality space options is challenging those seeking to expand their supply chains.

●
 Retail: Changing demographics, consumer expectations and omnichannel retailing will continue to reshape retail and its real estate environment in 2018. The consumer trend toward off-price and discount retail will continue, with mid-range retailers seeking new ways to limit share losses to lower-priced players.

●
 Multifamily: Developers are poised to register the second-highest annual completions count of this cycle in 2018, down by 9.2% from 2017s cycle peak. Because apartment starts began to slow in 2017, the multifamily market will get a reprieve from new supply by late 2018 and throughout 2019.

●
 Hotel: Forecasts for continued U.S. economic expansion portend a favorable year ahead for the U.S. lodging industry, with forecasts of income and employment growth  coupled with slowing supply growth  promising increased demand for hotels.

●
 Data Centers: The U.S. wholesale data center market continues to thrive, with sustained record-setting absorption levels for the past three years. Transformation and flexibility are the key themes in the multi-tenant data center space in 2018.

●
 Life Sciences: The greater health care needs of an aging population and quickening advancement in software and computing power have prompted strong biotech employment growth, with demand surges in most major markets and double-digit rent growth in some. But with the unsustainable rise in health care costs, the industry is under pressure to identify new, more effective, less costly solutions.

●
 Medical Office: The direction of health care policy and payment mechanisms may remain uncertain, but rapid growth in the older population will remain a significant tailwind for medical-office demand in the years ahead.

●
 Seniors Housing: The seniors housing market improved modestly in 2017 and is set to improve further in 2018, largely due to lower construction levels. For the most part, the traditional segments of seniors housingindependent living, assisted living, memory care and nursing careare not yet benefiting from baby boomer demand.

Loan Production Strategy

We have access to a database of top commercial real estate mortgage bankers nationwide through organizations such as Strategic Alliance Mortgage, LLC ( SAM ), which is a company comprised of the top independently owned commercial real estate investment banking firms located throughout the United States. Through SAM. firms utilizes their shared national knowledge to execute superior capital market solutions for developers, commercial real estate investors, investment management firms, asset management firms, real estate investment trusts and private real estate equity firms with the goal of utilizing their production networks. We have focused on firms that have experienced loan origination back office staff to ensure our CRE Loan services will be appropriately and professionally being marketed. Also, management has a proprietary database of 50 to 100 mortgage bankers to market their CRE Loan products to and generate Loan production internally for consistent deal flow. In addition, we believe that as our operations expand, we always have the opportunity to establish and retain an in-house sales team.)
Key Operational Highlights  Asset-Backed Financing

Our asset-backed lending operations will be based on the premise that business does not always go as planned; therefore we will work with clients to get them realigned financially with viable solutions for optimum profitability. Key among the services provided through this division, is a line of factoring products.

Our main product will be advance factoring, which enables clients to turn accounts receivable into cash-on-hand with secured working capital loans. Accounts receivable, inventory or other assets such as real estate, equipment and intellectual property will secure the factoring divisions working capital Loans. Advance rates are determined based on analysis of appropriate metrics for each collateral class (e.g. accounts receivable dilution, assessed value of tangible assets).

Competition

A number of much larger proven commercial real estate lenders such as JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman, Apollo Commercial Real Estate, and RAIT currently have established operations with large balance sheets and back office staff. However, we are a non-banking institution and are not regulated like the larger banks or typical CMBS lender in that we are not pigeon holed into immediately securitizing our assets. Rather we elect to use the standardized securitization underwriting characteristics to originate loans, consequently to mitigate liquidity-risk (i.e. recapitalization) with the ability to hold these loans on the un-tainted balance sheet in order to garner stable income to yield strong growth and market share. However, as most of these lenders have far longer operating histories and significantly larger financial resources than we do, there can be no assurance given that we can effectively compete.
Employees

We currently have no employees other than our executive officers. As noted above, we intend to rely on third parties retained by us and our affiliated lenders and third parties retained by them for services in areas such as loan origination and production, credit analysis, underwriting, due diligence, and loan servicing. As our operations grow, we may elect to bring certain, if not all of these services in house.

Legal Proceedings

Currently there are no legal proceedings pending or threatened against us.  However, from time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.  Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in any such matter may harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and business prospects.
Reports to Security Holders

We make available an annual report including audited financials on Form 10-K to security holders.  We file the necessary reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act,  including but not limited to, reports on Form 8-K, annual reports on Form 10-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
