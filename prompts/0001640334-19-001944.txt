ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Our company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 31, 2014. From inception to December 1, 2017, we were in the business of acquiring, developing, managing and selling residential and commercial income-producing properties in the Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio metropolitan areas. Our revenue primarily resulted from rental income from the tenants occupying the properties we acquire and from the proceeds of property sales. Since starting our business in March 2014, the Company has only acquired one light industrial facility in Dayton, Ohio. All real estate activity has been reclassed to discontinued operations. On December 1, 2017, our building was transferred to our primary shareholder in exchange for assumption of the debt associated with the purchase of the building.

On December 1, 2017, we underwent a change of control and discontinued our real estate business.

On May 8, 2018, we entered into a Capital Contribution Agreement (the “Capital Contribution Agreement”) with our principal shareholder, Silverlight International Limited (“Silverlight”). Under the terms of the Capital Contribution Agreement, Silverlight contributed the assets of Zshoppers.com, an electronics and general products ecommerce website, to our company, in exchange for the issuance of an additional 20,000 shares to Silverlight. To determine the number of shares received by Silverlight in connection with such contribution, our company valued the Zshoppers.com assets at $100,000 and divided this amount by a price per share equal to $5, which represents the most recent price per share for trades of our company’s stock on the Over-the-Counter Quotation System in which our company’s common stock is quoted. In connection with the capital contribution, our company assumed certain ongoing responsibilities of Silverlight for pay the former owner of Zshoppers.com (the “Seller”) under its asset purchase agreement for Zshoppers.com (the “Ongoing Obligations”). The Ongoing Obligations consist of a 25% profit share for the Seller for one year from the date of acquisition (the “Payment Period”), plus $1,000 per month for the Payment Period.

On October 1, 2018, our company disposed of Zhoppers, Inc.

Our Current Business

We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.

Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.

Management of our company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTCQB, such as: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) potentially improved trading efficiency; (v) potential stockholder liquidity; (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition; (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock awards or options; (viii) potentially enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States’ capital market.

We may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is anticipated that our sole officer and two directors will continue to manage the Company.

As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K. 

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.

Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on loans by affiliated and non-affiliated parties to provide financial contributions and services to keep our company operating. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective merger candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.
