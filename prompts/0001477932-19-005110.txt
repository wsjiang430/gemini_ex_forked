Industry Analysis/Competition

Industry Overview

According to the Global Virgin Coconut Oil Market report “The global virgin coconut oil market to grow at a CAGR of 9.75% during the period 2017-2021. The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global virgin coconut oil market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, the report considers the revenue generated from the sales of virgin coconut oil to individual consumers. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. The players in the market are coming up with new value-added products from virgin coconut oil. Such products will increase the consumer interest in the market and will also help the farmers to gather more return on their products. Only 8% of value addition in coconut oil is happening in India, while it is about 60%-70% in the Philippines. The value-added products will help the market grow during the forecast period. According to the report, the players are launching new products to stay competitive in the market and also to keep the interest of the consumers alive in the market. In October 2016, Dash Organics launched 100% raw extra virgin coconut oil. The new product is Fairtrade and certified 100% organic by Soil Association. In January 2016, Tiana Fair Trade Organics introduced its raw virgin coconut oil under the brand name Coco Pacific.

The product launch is backed by $0.61 million marketing campaign and the company has also roped in Aldo Zilli, celebrity chef and restaurateur, as the brand ambassador. In July 2015, FAL Food and Beverages launched its virgin coconut oil under the brand name Coco Joy. In December 2014, GraceKennedy Limited launched its virgin coconut oil after spending about $5 million on researches for the new product. Further, the report state that the product recalls of virgin coconut oil due to various reasons is one of the challenges to the growth of the market. The product recalls will create a negative impression among the consumers. The product recalls will also cause the consumers to lose trust in the products in the market. In March 2016, Nisshin OilliO Group issued a voluntary recall of its coconut oil products including Nisshin Extra Virgin Coconut Oil due to the presence of Aspergillus, a type of fungus, in the products. The company recalled about 1.6 million products.

Competition

According to Euromonitor International the category leader L’Oréal USA saw healthy growth of 6% in current value terms in 2016, which enabled it to maintain its value share of 22%. This growth was championed by its Garnier brand, which saw overall current value growth of 40% in hair care in 2016 as its value share rose from 2% to 3%. Garnier’s success was due to the launch of its on-trend Whole Blends line, catering to demand for natural and botanical products. However, L’Oréal’s growth continues to be constrained by its focus on the declining category of colorants, which it led in 2016 with a 40% value share.

Segmentation and customization are set to be the major areas of consumer interest in hair care in the US over the forecast period. Each American consumer tends to view their hair as unique and this means that they will likely be prepared to look for products which they see as tailored towards their own hair. A major component of this will be the growth anticipated in the area of multicultural hair care space as women of color turn to brands which address their specific hair care needs, especially needs that they feel that mainstream brands currently fail to meet. African Americans are turning away from relaxants and are instead buying increasing amounts of other hair care products designed for textured hair, a trend that will likely continue for some time. L’Oréal-owned brand Carol’s Daughter is benefitting from the growth of multicultural hair care, as are Shea Moisture and Mexican hair care brand Tio Nacho. Latino and multiracial women have also traditionally struggled to find hair care products which meet their unique needs and represent a fast-growing area of the population with increasing spending power.

The direct competitors for CocoLuv Inc. are Healthy Traditions, Jarrow Formulas, Nutiva, Coco & Co., Shea Moisture and Nature Well. There are many other companies that have lines of coconut oil products, however, we focus on Virgin Coconut Oil as our main driver of quality and do not see other companies that do not use Virgin Coconut Oil as direct competition.
