Item 1 – Business

 
Pure Cycle Corporation, a Colorado corporation (“we,” “us” or “our”), is a wholesale water and wastewater company and land development company that:
 
  
● | provides wholesale water and wastewater services;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | designs, constructs, operates and maintains water and wastewater systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | supplies untreated water for hydraulic fracturing and other commercial/industrial uses; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operates a land development segment that is developing a master planned mixed-use community.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Our wholesale water and wastewater segment provides wholesale water and wastewater services to customers within our exclusive service area and elsewhere in the Denver Metropolitan Area. We own or control water rights we use to provide domestic, irrigation, and raw water to our customers (including surface water, groundwater, reclaimed water rights and water storage rights). We own or control the infrastructure required to (i) withdraw, treat, store and deliver water (such as wells, diversion structures, pipelines, reservoirs and treatment facilities); (ii) collect, treat, store and reuse wastewater; and (iii) treat and deliver reclaimed water for irrigation use. We are principally targeting the “I-70 corridor,” a largely undeveloped area located east of downtown Denver and south of Denver International Airport along Interstate 70, as we expect the I-70 corridor to experience substantial growth over the next 30 years.
 
We provide untreated wholesale water services predominantly to industrial customers for various purposes and to oil and gas companies for hydraulic fracturing on properties located within or adjacent to our service areas. Oil and gas operators have leased more than 135,000 acres within and adjacent to our service areas to explore and develop oil and gas interests in the oil-rich Niobrara and other formations. We have capitalized on the need for significant water supplies for hydraulic fracturing in proximity to our water supplies and infrastructure.  In addition, we provide wholesale water and wastewater services to local governmental entities that in turn provide residential and commercial water and wastewater services to communities along the eastern slope of Colorado in the area referred to as the “Front Range,” extending essentially from Fort Collins on the north to Colorado Springs on the south. Our largest customer is the Rangeview Metropolitan District (the “Rangeview District”), which is a quasi-municipal political subdivision of the State of Colorado. We have the exclusive right to provide wholesale water and wastewater services to the Rangeview District and its end-use customers pursuant to the “Rangeview Water Agreements” and the “Non-Lowry Service Agreement” (each as defined below). Through the Rangeview District, we currently provide wholesale service to 462 SFE water connections and 214 SFE wastewater connections located in the Rangeview District’s service area of southeastern metropolitan Denver in an area called the Lowry Range and other nearby areas where we have acquired service rights.
 
In addition to our water and wastewater operations, we are developing approximately 930 acres of land we own along Denver’s I-70 corridor as a master planned community known as Sky Ranch. In June 2017, we entered into agreements to sell a total of 506 residential lots at Sky Ranch to three national home builders. Our agreements with our home builder customers follow one of two formats; one known as a lot delivery agreement whereby we receive progress payments from two builders for certain delivery milestones when completing a finished lot, and second a finished lot delivery agreement where we are paid by one builder as we deliver a completed finished lot.  Beginning in March of 2018, we began receiving payments from builders pursuant to our agreements for the construction of finished lots.  As of the close of our fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, we have delivered and have been paid for the delivery of 255 finished lots.
 
Pursuant to agreements with the Rangeview District, we are the exclusive provider of wholesale water and wastewater services to the residents of Sky Ranch.  As of August 31, 2019, we sold 113 water and wastewater tap fees and are providing water and wastewater services to customers at Sky Ranch.
 
Pure Cycle Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1976 and reincorporated in Colorado in 2008. Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, all references to “we,” “us,” or “our” are to Pure Cycle Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. Pure Cycle’s common stock trades on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol “PCYO.”

(2) | In August 2019, we acquired over 800 acre feet of tributary groundwater, approximately 150 acre feet of Henrylyn surface water (which is not usable in our service areas) and approximately 70 acre feet of non-tributary groundwater. Based on engineering estimates, we believe that the historic consumptive use of the tributary groundwater will be approximately 300 acre feet per year, which is the amount included under Surface Water attributable to the Lost Creek Supply in the table above. Henrylyn is a statutory irrigation district that owns its water rights in trust for its landowners. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We believe we can serve approximately 60,000 SFEs.
 
Our service areas and water and land assets are described in greater detail in the maps and discussion that follow.

Rangeview Water Supply and the Lowry Range
 
Our Rangeview Water – We own or control approximately 26,985 acre feet of tributary surface water, non-tributary groundwater and not non-tributary groundwater, and approximately 26,000 acre feet of adjudicated reservoir sites that we refer to as our “Rangeview Water Supply” and an additional approximately 2,200 acre feet of water that is not part of our Rangeview Water Supply. Our water is principally located in the southeast Denver metropolitan area at the “Lowry Range,” which is owned by the State Board of Land Commissioners (the “Land Board”) and is described below.
Rangeview Water Agreements – We acquired our Rangeview Water Supply in April 1996 pursuant to the following agreements:
 
  
(i) | The 1996 Amended and Restated Lease Agreement between the Land Board and the Rangeview District, which was superseded by the 2014 Amended and Restated Lease Agreement, dated July 10, 2014 (the “Lease”), among the Land Board, the Rangeview District and us; 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | The Agreement for Sale of non-tributary and not non-tributary groundwater which we can “export” from the Lowry Range to supply water to nearby communities (this portion of the Rangeview Water Supply is referred to as our “Export Water”) between us and the Rangeview District (the “Export Agreement”); and 
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | The 1996 Service Agreement between us and the Rangeview District for the provision of water service to the Rangeview District’s customers located on the Lowry Range, which was superseded by the Amended and Restated Service Agreement, dated July 11, 2014 (the “Lowry Service Agreement”), between us and the Rangeview District. 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Additionally, in 1997 we entered into a Wastewater Service Agreement (the “Lowry Wastewater Agreement”) with the Rangeview District to provide wastewater service to the Rangeview District’s customers on the Lowry Range.
 
The Lease, the Export Agreement, the Lowry Service Agreement and the Lowry Wastewater Agreement are collectively referred to as the “Rangeview Water Agreements.”
 
Pursuant to the Rangeview Water Agreements, we design, construct, operate and maintain the Rangeview District’s water and wastewater systems to allow the Rangeview District to provide water and wastewater service to its customers located within the Rangeview District’s service area at the Lowry Range and other approved areas. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease, we are the exclusive water and wastewater provider on the Lowry Range, and we operate both the water and the wastewater systems during our contract period on behalf of the Rangeview District, which owns the facilities for both systems. At the expiration of our contract term in 2081, ownership of the water system facilities located on the Lowry Range used to deliver leased water (which excludes Export Water) to customers will revert to the Land Board, with the Rangeview District retaining ownership of the wastewater facilities and the water system and related facilities used to deliver Export Water and other water to customers off the Lowry Range. Through facilities we own, we use our Export Water, and we intend to use other supplies owned by us, to provide wholesale water service and wastewater service to customers located outside of the Lowry Range, including customers of the Rangeview District and other governmental entities and industrial and commercial customers.
 
Of the total water comprising our Rangeview Water Supply, we own 11,650 acre feet of Export Water, which consists of 10,000 acre feet of groundwater and 1,650 acre feet of average yield surface water, pending completion by the Land Board of documentation related to the exercise of our right to substitute 1,650 acre feet of our groundwater for a comparable amount of surface water. Additionally, assuming the completion of the substitution of groundwater for surface water, we hold the exclusive right to develop and deliver through the year 2081 the remaining water to customers either on or off the Lowry Range. The Rangeview Water Agreements also grant us the right to use surface reservoir capacity to provide water service to customers both on and off the Lowry Range.
 
The Lowry Range Property – The Lowry Range is located in unincorporated Arapahoe County, about 20 miles southeast of downtown Denver. The Lowry Range is one of the largest contiguous parcels under single ownership next to a major metropolitan area in the United States. The Lowry Range is approximately 27,000 acres in size or about 40 square miles of land. Of the 27,000 acres, pursuant to our agreements with the Land Board and the Rangeview District, we have the exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services to approximately 24,000 acres of the Lowry Range.
 
Rangeview Metropolitan District – The Rangeview District is a quasi-municipal corporation and political subdivision of Colorado formed in 1986 for the purpose of providing water and wastewater service to the Lowry Range and other approved areas. The Rangeview District is governed by an elected board of directors. Eligible voters and persons eligible to serve as directors of the Rangeview District must own an interest in property within the boundaries of the Rangeview District. We own certain rights and real property interests which encompass the current boundaries of the Rangeview District. The current directors of the Rangeview District are Mark W. Harding (our President, Chief Financial Officer and a director), Scott E. Lehman (a Pure Cycle employee), and Dirk Lashnits (a Pure Cycle employee), and one independent board member. Pursuant to Colorado law, directors may receive $100 for each board meeting they attend, up to a maximum of $1,600 per year. Mr. Harding, Mr. Lehman, and Mr. Lashnits have all elected to forego these payments.

Land Board Royalties – Pursuant to the Rangeview Water Agreements, the Land Board is entitled to royalty payments based on a percentage of revenues earned from water sales that utilize water from the Rangeview Water Supply. The calculation of royalties depends on the water source, whether the customer is a public or private entity, and the location of the customer. The Land Board does not receive a royalty from wastewater services.
Water Customers – When we develop, operate and deliver water service utilizing water from our Rangeview Water Supply, payments from customers generate royalties to the Land Board at a rate of 12% of gross revenues from private customers and customers on the Lowry Range and 10% from public entity customers. In the event that either (i) metered production of water used on the Lowry Range in any calendar year exceeds 13,000 acre feet or (ii) 10,000 surface acres on the Lowry Range have been rezoned to non-agricultural use, finally platted and water tap agreements have been entered into with respect to all improvements to be constructed on such acreage, the Land Board may elect, at its option, to receive, in lieu of its royalty of 12% of gross revenues, 50% of the collective net profits (ours and the Rangeview District’s) derived from the sale or other disposition of water on the Lowry Range. To date, neither of these conditions has been met, and such conditions are not likely to be met any time soon. In addition to royalties on the sale of metered water deliveries, the Land Board will receive a royalty on the sale of water taps, except for the sale of any taps to Sky Ranch, at the rate of two percent of the gross amount received from the sale of a water tap. Escalated royalties would be owed if we were to sell our Export Water outright rather than delivering water service.  We do not currently anticipate selling our Export Water.
Annual Production Fee – We are also required to pay the Land Board a minimum annual water production fee of $45,600 per year, which is to be credited against future royalties.
South Metropolitan Water Supply Authority (“SMWSA”) and Water Infrastructure Supply Efficiency Partnership (“WISE”) – SMWSA is a municipal water authority in the State of Colorado organized to pursue the acquisition and development of water supplies on behalf of its members, including the Rangeview District. SMWSA members include 14 Denver area water providers in Arapahoe and Douglas Counties.  Pursuant to certain agreements between the Rangeview District and us, we agreed to provide funding to enable the Rangeview District to acquire rights to water projects undertaken by SMWSA, including rights to water supplied pursuant to the cooperative water project known as “WISE”, which provides for the purchase and construction of certain infrastructure (pipelines, water storage facilities, water treatment facilities, and other appurtenant facilities) to deliver water to and among the 10 members of the South Metro WISE Authority, consisting of the Rangeview District and nine other SMWSA members (“SMWA”), the City and County of Denver acting through its Board of Water Commissioners (“Denver Water”) and the City of Aurora acting by and through its utility enterprise (“Aurora Water”). In exchange for funding the Rangeview District’s obligations in WISE, we have the sole right to use and reuse the Rangeview District’s approximate 7% share of the WISE water and infrastructure to provide water service to the Rangeview District’s customers and to receive the revenue from such service. Our current WISE subscription entitles us to approximately three million gallons per day of transmission pipeline capacity and 500 acre feet per year of water. In accordance with certain financing agreements, to date we have provided approximately $3.5 million of financing to the Rangeview District to fund its obligation to purchase infrastructure for WISE, its obligations related to SMWSA, and the construction of a connection to the WISE system. We anticipate that we will be spending the following over the next five fiscal years to fund the Rangeview District’s purchase of its share of the water transmission line and additional facilities, water and related assets for WISE and to fund operations and water deliveries related to WISE:

East Cherry Creek Valley System – Pursuant to a 1982 agreement, the Rangeview District may purchase water produced from East Cherry Creek Valley Water and Sanitation District’s (“ECCV”) Land Board system. ECCV’s Land Board system is comprised of eight wells and more than 10 miles of buried water pipeline located on the Lowry Range. In May 2012, we entered into an agreement to operate and maintain the ECCV facilities allowing us to utilize the system to provide water to commercial and industrial customers, including customers providing water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells. Our costs associated with the use of the ECCV system are a flat monthly fee of $8,000 per month from January 2013 through December 31, 2020 and will decrease to $3,000 per month beginning January 1, 2021 through April 2032. Additionally, we pay a fee per 1,000 gallons of water produced from ECCV’s system, which is included in the water usage fees charged to customers. In addition, the ECCV system costs us approximately $12,500 per month to maintain.

Revenues from our Water Supply – We generate revenues through our wholesale water and wastewater operations predominantly from three sources: (i) monthly water usage and wastewater treatment fees, (ii) one-time water and wastewater tap fees and construction fees/Special Facility funding, and (iii) consulting fees. Our revenue sources and how we account for them are described in greater detail below. We typically negotiate the payment terms for tap fees, construction fees, and other water and wastewater service fees with our wholesale customers as a component of our service agreements prior to construction of the project. However, with respect to customers on the Lowry Range, pursuant to the Lease, the Rangeview District’s rates and charges to such end-use customers may not exceed the average of similar rates and charges of three nearby water providers.
 
  
(i) | Monthly Water Usage and Wastewater Treatment Fees – Monthly wholesale water usage fees are assessed to our customers based on actual metered deliveries to their end-use customers each month. Water usage fees are based on a tiered pricing structure that provides for higher prices as customers use greater amounts of water. The water usage fees for end-use customers on the Lowry Range are noted below in Table C: 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table C – Lowry Range Tiered Water Usage Pricing Structure
 
 
 | Price ($ per thousand gallons) | 
---------------------------------+--------------------------------+------
Base charge per SFE | $ | 32.74
0 gallons to 15,000 gallons | $ | 4.63 
15,001 gallons to 30,000 gallons | $ | 8.10 
30,001 gallons and above | $ | 9.95 



The figures in Table C reflect the amounts charged to the Rangeview District’s end-use customers on the Lowry Range. In exchange for providing water service to the Rangeview District’s Lowry Range customers, we receive 98% of the usage charges received by the Rangeview District relating to water services after deducting the required royalty to the Land Board (described above at Rangeview Water Supply and Lowry Range – Land Board Royalties).
 
The amounts charged by the Rangeview District to its end-use customers off the Lowry Range are determined pursuant to the Rangeview District’s service agreements with such customers and such rates may vary. In exchange for providing water service to the Rangeview District’s customers off the Lowry Range, we receive 98% of the usage charges received by the Rangeview District relating to water services after deducting any required royalty to the Land Board. The royalty to the Land Board is required for water service provided utilizing our Rangeview Water Supply, which includes most of our current customers off the Lowry Range except those at the Elbert & Highway 86 Commercial District (“Wild Pointe”).
 
In addition to the tiered water usage pricing structure, we currently charge a hydrant rate of $13.00 per thousand gallons for commercial and industrial customers. We also collect other immaterial fees and charges from customers and other users to cover miscellaneous administrative and service expenses, such as application fees, review fees and permit fees.
 
In exchange for providing wastewater services, we receive 90% of the Rangeview District’s monthly wastewater treatment fees, as well as the right to use or sell the reclaimed water.
 
  
(ii) | Water and Wastewater Tap Fees and Construction Fees/Special Facility Funding – Tap fees are typically paid by developers in advance of construction activities and are non-refundable. Tap fees are typically used to fund construction of the Wholesale Facilities and defray the acquisition costs of acquiring water rights. 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rangeview District’s 2019 water tap fees are $26,675 per SFE, and its wastewater tap fees are $4,659.
 
In exchange for providing water service to the Rangeview District’s customers on the Lowry Range, we receive 100% of the Rangeview District’s tap fees after deducting the two percent royalty to the Land Board described above. If water taps are sold to customers not located on the Lowry Range that are to be serviced utilizing the Rangeview Water Supply (other than taps to Sky Ranch, which are exempt), the two percent royalty to the Land Board is deducted from the amount we receive. In exchange for providing wastewater services, whether to customers on or off the Lowry Range, we receive 100% of the Rangeview District’s wastewater tap fees.
 
Construction fees are fees we receive, typically in advance, from developers for us to build certain infrastructure such as Special Facilities, which are normally the responsibility of the developer.
 
  
(iii) | Consulting Fees – Consulting fees are fees we receive, typically on a monthly basis, from municipalities and area water providers along the I-70 corridor, for systems with respect to which we provide contract operations services. 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Water Sales for Fracking
 
We provide water for hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) of oil and gas wells being developed in the Niobrara Formation around our service area and our Sky Ranch property. Oil and gas drilling in our area is affected by the price of oil, state, local and federal government regulations and the number of wells drilled and fracked can vary from year to year. Each well developed in the Niobrara Formation utilizes between 10 and 20 million gallons of water to drill and frack, which equates to selling water to between approximately 100 and 200 homes for an entire year.
 
Water revenues from sales of water for the construction of well sites, drilling and fracking wells developed in the Niobrara Formation were approximately $4,238,300 and $4,044,300 during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. With a large percentage of the acreage surrounding the Lowry Range in Arapahoe, Adams, Elbert, and portions of Douglas Counties already leased by oil companies, we anticipate providing additional water for drilling and fracking of oil and gas wells in the future. Previously, nearly all oil and gas development was attributable to our largest fracking customer ConocoPhillips Company (“ConocoPhillips”). However, in recent years, there have been three other oil and gas companies acquiring lease interests in the area, and each of these companies has drilled and fracked wells in the area. We anticipate continued development of oil and gas wells at the Lowry Range, Sky Ranch and the surrounding area by multiple operators. See “Our water sales for the past two years have been highly concentrated among companies providing fracking services to the oil and gas industry, and such sales can fluctuate significantly”, “The enactment of Senate Bill 19-181 “Protect Public Welfare Oil and Gas Operations” increased the regulatory authority of local governments in Colorado over facilities siting and surface impacts of oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on our water sales to the oil and gas industry for hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) and demand for new homes at Sky Ranch” and “Our land development segment may be subject to risks related to oil and gas operations in the vicinity of our Sky Ranch development, which could have an adverse impact on the marketability and/or value of our Sky Ranch property” in Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Service to Customers Not on the Lowry Range
 
In addition to our Lowry Range service agreements, we have an agreement with the Rangeview District to provide exclusive water and wastewater service, including the design, construction, operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems to serve the Rangeview District’s customers located outside the Lowry Range service area (e.g. Wild Pointe and Sky Ranch) (the “Non-Lowry Service Agreement).  In exchange for providing water and wastewater services to the Rangeview District’s customers that are not on the Lowry Range, we receive 100% of water and wastewater tap fees, 98% of the water usage fees, and 90% of the monthly wastewater service and usage fees received by the Rangeview District from these customers, after deduction of royalties due to the Land Board, if applicable. See Rangeview Water Supply and Lowry Range – Land Board Royalties above. The water usage fees to be collected for service at Sky Ranch may be subject to the Land Board royalty.
 
Wild Pointe – Elbert & Highway 86 Commercial Metropolitan District – In 2017, we entered into an agreement with the Rangeview District, which had entered into an agreement with Elbert & Highway 86 Commercial Metropolitan District (the “Elbert 86 District”) to operate and maintain a water system for residential and commercial customers at the Wild Pointe development in Elbert County. The water system includes two deep water wells, a pump station, treatment facility, storage facility, over eight miles of transmission lines, and approximately 457 acre feet of water rights serving the development. We provided $1.6 million in funding to acquire the exclusive rights to operate and maintain all the water facilities in exchange for payment of the remaining residential and commercial tap fees and annual water use fees. Service to Wild Pointe is governed by the Non-Lowry Service Agreement.
 
Sky Ranch Water and Wastewater Service – As described in more detail below, we are developing approximately 930 acres of land we own as a master planned community known as Sky Ranch. Pursuant to the Sky Ranch Water and Wastewater Service Agreement, dated June 19, 2017, between PCY Holdings, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary and the owner of the Sky Ranch property (“PCY Holdings”), and the Rangeview District, PCY Holdings agreed to construct certain facilities necessary to provide water and wastewater service to Sky Ranch, and the Rangeview District agreed to provide water and wastewater services for the Sky Ranch development. Pursuant to the Non-Lowry Service Agreement, we are the exclusive provider of water and wastewater services to future residents of the Sky Ranch development.
 
Sky Ranch Development
 
In 2010, we purchased approximately 930 acres of undeveloped land located in unincorporated Arapahoe County known as Sky Ranch. Sky Ranch is located directly adjacent to I-70, 16 miles east of downtown Denver, four miles north of the Lowry Range, and four miles south of Denver International Airport.
 

10
 

The property includes rights to approximately 830 acre feet of water and approximately 640 acres of oil and gas mineral rights and has been zoned for residential, commercial and retail uses that may include approximately 5,000 SFEs. Sky Ranch is zoned for 3,200 homes and over 2.0 million square feet of commercial, retail and light industrial development. Sky Ranch will develop in multiple phases over a number of years. Our first phase of 151 acres is platted for 506 detached single-family residential lots. We have entered into purchase and sale agreements (described in more detail below) with three national home builders pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and the builders agreed to purchase, the initial 506 residential lots at the property. We began construction of 255 residential lots for entry-level housing (houses costing in the $375,000 to $470,000 range) on March 1, 2018, and as of August 31, 2019 we have delivered and received payment for 255 finished lots. We expect to deliver an additional 200 lots in 2020 and the balance of the lots thereafter depending on home sales. We estimate that build out of our initial 506 lots will take between three and four years. We have leased the oil and gas minerals underlying the land to a major independent exploration and production company.
 

11
 

In June 2017, we entered into purchase and sale agreements and related agreements (collectively, the “Builder Contracts”) with three separate home builders pursuant to which we agreed to sell, and each builder agreed to purchase, a certain number (totaling 506) of single-family, detached residential lots at Sky Ranch. We are developing finished lots for each of the three home builders (which are lots on which homes are ready to be built that include roads, curbs, wet and dry utilities, storm drains and other improvements). Each builder is required to purchase water and sewer taps for the lots from the Rangeview District, the cost of which depends on the size of the lot, the size of the house, and the amount of irrigated turf. Pursuant to the Non-Lowry Service Agreement, we will receive all of the water tap fees and wastewater tap fees. We will receive the monthly service fees and usage fees for water and wastewater services received by the Rangeview District from customers at Sky Ranch net of fees retained by the Rangeview District noted above.
 
As of August 31, 2019, we have completed and sold 255 finished lots to our home builder customers, and have received payments of $18,086,200, $14,094,900 of which we have recognized as revenues. In addition, we have completed grading, water, sewer, and storm drain improvements for the remaining 251 lots and expect to finish the remaining improvements during fiscal year 2020.  All three of our home builder customers have accelerated their purchases of finished lots from their original agreements, and we expect to close on an additional 200 finished lots in 2020 and on the remaining 51 lots in early fiscal year 2021.
 
Pursuant to the Builder Contracts, we must cause the Rangeview District to install and construct off-site infrastructure improvements (i.e., a wastewater reclamation facility and wholesale water facilities) for the provision of water and wastewater service to the property. We have substantially completed all of the off-site infrastructure improvements for the initial 506 residential lots.
 
Public improvements, such as roads, parks, and water and sanitary sewer mains, that will be shared by all homeowners in the development and not specific to a finished lot will ultimately be owned by the Rangeview District, the Sky Ranch Districts (as defined below) or the Sky Ranch Community Authority Board (the “CAB”). Upon completion of certain public improvements and acceptance by the Sky Ranch Districts or the CAB, we will be entitled to reimbursement for the verified costs incurred with respect to such improvements. We estimate that the total capital required to develop lots in the first phase (506 lots) of Sky Ranch will be approximately $35 million, which includes estimated reimbursable costs of approximately of $29 million that will be reimbursable to us by the CAB, and that lot sales to home builders will generate approximately $36 million in revenues, providing a margin before reimbursements on lots of approximately $1 million. The Company and the CAB have agreed that no payment is required by the CAB with respect to reimbursable costs unless and until the CAB and/or the Sky Ranch Districts issue bonds in an amount sufficient to reimburse us for all or a portion of advances provided or expenses incurred for reimbursables. Due to this contingency, the reimbursable costs will be included in Inventories and subsequently expensed through Land development construction costs until the point in time when bonding is obtained and the CAB reimburses the Company for the public improvements. The portion of the reimbursable costs that are repaid will then be recorded as a note receivable and will reduce any remaining capitalized expenses to the extent available. Any reimbursable costs repaid in excess of capitalized expenses will be recognized as other income.

Utility revenues are derived from tap fees (which vary depending on lot size, house size, and amount of irrigated turf) and usage fees (which are monthly water usage and wastewater treatment fees). Our current Sky Ranch water tap fees are $26,675 (per SFE), and wastewater taps fees are $4,659 (per SFE).
 
We are designing and engineering our second phase, which will include approximately 320 acres of residential development and 155 acres of commercial, retail, and industrial development along the I-70 frontage. We expect to have multiple phases being developed concurrently and expect the development of the Sky Ranch project to occur over 10–14 years, depending on demand.
 
Sky Ranch Metropolitan District Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 – The Sky Ranch Metropolitan District Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5 are quasi-municipal corporations and political subdivisions of Colorado formed in 2004 for the purpose of providing service to the approximately 930 acres of the Sky Ranch property (the “Sky Ranch Districts”). The Sky Ranch Districts are governed by an elected board of directors. Eligible voters and persons eligible to serve as directors of the Sky Ranch Districts must own an interest in property within the boundaries of the district. We own certain rights and real property interests which encompass the current boundaries of the districts. The current directors of the districts are Mark W. Harding (our President, Chief Financial Officer and a director), Scott E. Lehman (a Pure Cycle employee), and Dirk Lashnits (a Pure Cycle employee), and one independent board member. Pursuant to Colorado law, directors may receive $100 for each board meeting they attend, up to a maximum of $1,600 per year. Mr. Harding, Mr. Lehman, and Mr. Lashnits have all elected to forego these payments.
Sky Ranch Community Authority Board
 
Pursuant to a certain Community Authority Board Establishment Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time, Sky Ranch Metropolitan District No. 1 and Sky Ranch Metropolitan District No. 5 formed the CAB to, among other things, design, construct, finance, operate and maintain certain public improvements for the benefit of the property within the boundaries and/or service area of the Sky Ranch Districts. In order for the public improvements to be constructed and/or acquired, it is necessary for each Sky Ranch District, directly or through the CAB, to be able to fund the improvements and pay its ongoing operations and maintenance expenses related to the provision of services that benefit the property. We entered into agreements, first with Sky Ranch Metropolitan District No. 5 in 2014 and later with the CAB, requiring us to fund expenses related to the construction of an agreed upon list of public improvements for the Sky Ranch property.
 
In September 2018 and effective as of November 13, 2017, the parties consolidated and superseded these previous agreements with one new agreement pursuant to which:
   
● | the CAB agreed to repay the amounts owed by Sky Ranch Metropolitan District No. 5 to Pure Cycle, and the previous agreement entered into between Pure Cycle and Sky Ranch Metropolitan District No. 5 in 2014 was terminated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | previous agreements between the CAB and Pure Cycle were terminated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the CAB acknowledged all amounts owed to Pure Cycle under the terminated agreements, as well as amounts we incurred to finance the formation of the CAB; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pure Cycle agreed to fund expenses related to the construction of an agreed upon list of improvements to be constructed by the CAB with an estimated cost of $30 million (including improvements already funded) on an as-needed basis for calendar years 2018–2023. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Advances and verified costs expended by us for expenses related to the construction of the agreed upon improvements are reimbursable to us by the CAB.  All amounts owed under the terminated agreements and each reimbursable expense incurred under the new agreement accrues interest at a rate of 6% per annum from the time funds are advanced by us to the CAB or costs are incurred by us for expenses related to the construction of improvements, as applicable. No repayment is required of the CAB for advances made to the CAB or expenses incurred related to the construction of improvements unless and until the CAB and/or Sky Ranch Districts issue bonds in an amount sufficient to reimburse us for all or a portion of advances or other expenses incurred. The CAB agrees to exercise reasonable efforts to issue bonds to reimburse us subject to certain limitations. In addition, the CAB agrees to utilize any available moneys not otherwise pledged to payment of debt, used for operation and maintenance expenses, or otherwise encumbered, to reimburse us. Any advances or expenses not paid or reimbursed by the CAB by December 31, 2058, shall be deemed forever discharged and satisfied in full. As of August 31, 2019, we have advanced the CAB approximately $20 million for the construction of public improvements, including improvements with respect to earthwork, erosion control, streets, drainage, and landscaping and expect to fund an additional estimated $8.4 million in buildout costs associated with our first 506 lots of development that we expect will be reimbursable by the CAB.
 
The current directors of the CAB are Mark W. Harding (our President, Chief Financial Officer and a director), Scott E. Lehman (a Pure Cycle employee), and Dirk Lashnits (a Pure Cycle employee), and one independent board member. Pursuant to Colorado law, directors may receive $100 for each board meeting they attend, up to a maximum of $1,600 per year. Mr. Harding, Mr. Lehman, and Mr. Lashnits have all elected to forego these payments.

Oil and Gas Leases | | 
-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | | In 2011, we entered into a three-year Oil and Gas Lease (the “O&G Lease”) and Surface Use and Damage Agreement and received an up-front payment and a 20% of gross proceeds royalty (less certain taxes) from the sale of any oil and gas produced from the approximately 634 acres of mineral estate we own at Sky Ranch. In 2014, the O&G Lease was extended for an additional two (2) years. The O&G Lease is now held by production, and we have been receiving royalties from the oil and gas production from two wells drilled within our mineral interest. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019, we received $148,300 in royalties attributable to these two wells. 
 | In September 2017, we entered into a three-year Paid-Up Oil and Gas Lease with Bison Oil and Gas, LLP (the “Bison Lease”) for the purpose of exploring for, developing, producing, and marketing oil and gas from 40 acres of mineral estate we own adjacent to the Lowry Range, and we received an up-front payment of $167,200. In July 2019, we entered into an Agreement on Locations of Oil and Gas Operations covering approximately 16 acres with the operator of the O&G Lease (the “OGOA”). The Company received an up-front payment of $573,700 in fiscal 2019 for the OGOA, which will be recognized 

 as income on a straight-line basis over three years (the term of the agreement). If after three years the operator has not spud at least one well on the oil and gas operations area, the operator may extend the right to the OGOA one additional year by paying us $75,000. The operator may only extend the OGOA for two additional years for a total of five years. We recognized lease income of $26,200 during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 related to the up-front payment received pursuant to the OGOA. As of August 31, 2019, we have deferred revenues of $547,500 related to the OGOA that will be recognized into income ratably through July 2022.
 
Arkansas River Land and Minerals
 
We own three farms totaling 700 acres in the Arkansas River Valley. The farms were acquired in order to correct dry-up covenant issues related to water-only farms, and we currently lease all three farms for dry land grazing. We intend to sell the farms in due course and have classified the farms as long-term investments. We also own approximately 13,900 acres of mineral interests in the Arkansas River Valley, which have an estimated value of approximately $1.4 million. We currently have no plans to sell our mineral interests.
Significant Customers
 
Water and Wastewater
 
Our wholesale water and wastewater use sales to the Rangeview District pursuant to the Rangeview Water Agreements accounted for 5%, 6% and 26% of our total water revenues for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Rangeview District has one significant customer, the Ridgeview Youth Services Center (“Ridgeview”). Pursuant to our Rangeview Water Agreements, we are providing water and wastewater services to Ridgeview on behalf of the Rangeview District. Ridgeview accounted for 3%, 4% and 21% of our total water revenues for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Our industrial water sales (i) directly and indirectly to ConocoPhillips accounted for approximately 74%, 68% and 30% and (ii) to other oil and gas operators accounted for approximately 16%, 21% and 25%, of our total water revenues for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.
 
Land Development
 
Revenues from three customers represented 100% of the Company’s land development revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019. Richmond American Homes of Colorado, Inc. represented 32%, and each of KB Home Colorado Inc. and Taylor Morrison of Colorado, Inc. represented 34% of the Company’s land development revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019. Revenues from two customers represented 98% of the Company’s land development revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. Richmond American Homes of Colorado, Inc. represented 66% and Taylor Morrison of Colorado, Inc. represented 32% of the Company’s land development revenues for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. No revenues were recognized from the Company’s land development activities for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017.
Our Projected Operations
 
This section should be read in conjunction with Item 1A – Risk Factors.
 
Along the Colorado Front Range, there are over 70 water providers with varying needs for replacement and/or new water supplies. We believe that we are well positioned to assist certain of these providers in meeting their current and future water needs.
 

14
 
We design, construct and operate our water and wastewater facilities using advanced water treatment and wastewater treatment technologies, which allow us to use our water supplies in an efficient and environmentally sustainable manner. We plan to develop our water and wastewater systems in stages to efficiently meet demands in our service areas by managing capital investments required for construction of facilities. We use third-party contractors to construct our facilities as needed. We employ licensed water and wastewater operators to operate our water and wastewater systems. As our systems expand, we expect to hire additional personnel to operate our systems, which include water production, treatment, testing, storage, distribution, metering, billing, and operations management.
 
Our water and wastewater systems conjunctively use surface and groundwater supplies and storage of raw water and highly treated effluent supplies to provide a balanced sustainable water supply for our wholesale customers and their end-use customers. Integrating conservation practices and incentives, together with effective water reuse, demonstrates our commitment to providing environmentally responsible and sustainable water and wastewater services. Water supplies and water storage reservoirs are competitively sought throughout the west and along the Front Range of Colorado. We believe that regional cooperation among area water providers in developing new water supplies, water storage, and transmission and distribution systems provides the most cost-effective way of expanding and enhancing service capacities for area water providers. We continue to seek opportunities for developing water supplies and water storage opportunities with other area water providers.
 
We expect the development of our Rangeview Water Supply to require a significant number of high capacity deep water wells. We anticipate drilling separate wells into each of the three principal aquifers located beneath the Lowry Range. It is expected that each well will deliver water to central water treatment facilities for treatment prior to delivery to customers. Development of our Lowry Range surface water supplies will require facilities to divert surface water to storage reservoirs to be located on the Lowry Range and treatment facilities to treat the water prior to introduction into our distribution systems. Surface water diversion facilities will be designed with capacities to divert the surface water when available (particularly during seasonal events such as spring run-off and summer storms) for storage in reservoirs to be constructed on the Lowry Range. Based on preliminary engineering estimates, the full build-out of water facilities (including diversion structures, transmission pipelines, reservoirs, and water treatment facilities) on the Lowry Range will cost in excess of $850 million, based on estimated costs, and will accommodate water service to customers located on and outside the Lowry Range. We expect this build out to occur in phases over an extended period of at least 50 years, and we expect that tap fees will be sufficient to fund the infrastructure costs.
 
Our Denver-based supplies are a valuable, locally available resource located near the point of use. This enables us to incrementally develop infrastructure to produce, treat and deliver water to customers based on their growing demands.
 
During fiscal 2019, we invested approximately $14.1 million in plant and facilities that interconnect the Rangeview District, WISE, and Sky Ranch water and wastewater systems and provide water and wastewater services to our customers. We expect to continue to invest in plants and facilities as our customer demands grow.
 
We are in the process of developing our Sky Ranch property, including building finished lots for home builders and building the water and wastewater infrastructure for residential and commercial development of the property. In March 2018, we began construction of improvements for finished lots and will phase the construction of finished lots consistent with builder purchases of finished lots as defined in our agreements. The timing for us to develop the remaining phases of the property will be largely dependent on the Denver real estate market and the interest we receive from home builders and developers. During fiscal 2019, we invested approximately $17.7 million in our Sky Ranch property to deliver 255 finished lots and make other improvements to the remaining 251 lots.
 
We plan to develop additional water assets within the Denver area and are exploring opportunities to utilize our water assets in areas adjacent to our existing water supplies.
 
Water and Growth in Colorado
 
Colorado has experienced a robust housing market over the past 48 months. The key drivers to housing in the area are:
 
  
● | Housing Starts – From September 2018 to September 2019, annual housing starts decreased by 9%. From September 2017 to September 2018, annual housing starts increased by 11.6%. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unemployment – The unemployment rate in Colorado was 2.2% at August 31, 2019, compared to a national unemployment rate of 3.5%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Population – The Denver Regional Council of Governments, a voluntary association of over 50 county and municipal governments in the Denver metropolitan area, estimates that the Denver metropolitan area population will increase by about 38% from today’s 3.4 million people to 4.7 million people by the year 2040. A Statewide Water Supply Initiative report by the Colorado Water Conservation Board estimates that the South Platte River basin, which includes the Denver metropolitan region, will grow from a current population of 3.9 million to 4.9 million by the year 2030, while the state’s population will increase from 5.7 million to 7.2 million. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demand – Approximately 70% of the state’s projected population increase is anticipated to occur within the South Platte River basin. Significant increases in Colorado’s population, particularly in the Denver metro region and other areas in the water-short South Platte River basin, together with increasing agricultural, recreational, and environmental water demands, will intensify competition for water supplies. The estimated population increases are expected to result in demands for water services in excess of the current capabilities of municipal service providers, especially during drought conditions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




15
 
  
● | Supply – The Statewide Water Supply Initiative estimates that population growth in the Denver region and the South Platte River basin could result in additional water supply demands of over 400,000 acre feet by the year 2030. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development – Colorado law requires property developers to demonstrate that they have sufficient water supplies for their proposed projects before zoning applications will be considered. These factors indicate that water and availability of water will continue to be critical to growth prospects for the region and the state, and that competition for available sources of water will continue to intensify. We focus the marketing of our water supplies and services to developers and home builders that are active along the Colorado Front Range as well as other area water providers in need of additional supplies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Colorado’s future water supply needs will be met through conservation, reuse and the development of new supplies. The Rangeview District’s rules and regulations for water and wastewater service call for adherence to strict conservation measures, including low-flow water fixtures, high efficiency appliances, and advanced irrigation control devices. Additionally, our systems are designed and constructed using a dual-pipe water distribution system to segregate the delivery of high quality potable drinking water to our local governmental entities and their end-use customers through one system and a second system to supply raw or reclaimed water for irrigation demands. About one-half of the water used by a typical Denver-area residential water customer is used for outdoor landscape and lawn irrigation. We believe that raw or reclaimed water supplies provide the lowest cost, most environmentally sustainable water for outdoor irrigation. We expect our systems to include an extensive water reclamation system in which essentially all effluent water from wastewater treatment plants will be reused to meet non-potable water demands. Our dual-distribution systems demonstrate our commitment to environmentally responsible water management policies in our water-short region.
 
Labor and Raw Materials
 
We competitively bid contracts for infrastructure improvements (grading, utilities, roads, water and wastewater) at Sky Ranch.  Contractors enter into fixed priced contracts where the contractor is at risk for cost overruns prior to completion of improvements.  Under these fixed-price contracts, the contract prices are established in part based on fixed, firm subcontractor quotes on contracts and on cost and scheduling estimates. These quotes or estimates may be based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other issues. Increased costs or shortages of skilled labor and/or concrete, steel, pipe and other materials could cause increases in property development costs and delays. These shortages and delays may result in delays in the delivery of the residential lots under development, reduced gross margins from lot sales, or both. While we contract with third parties for our labor and materials at a fixed price, which should allow us to mitigate the risks associated with increases in the cost of labor and building materials, other developments may arise which would increase lot delivery costs.
Competition
 
Water and Wastewater Services
 
We negotiate individual service agreements with our governmental customers and with their developers and/or home builders to design, construct and operate water and wastewater systems and to provide services to end-use customers of governmental entities and to commercial and industrial customers. These service agreements seek to address all aspects of the development of the water and wastewater systems, including:

(i) | the purchase of water and wastewater taps in exchange for our obligation to construct certain Wholesale Facilities;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the establishment of payment terms, timing, capacity and location of Special Facilities (if any); and
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | specific terms related to our provision of ongoing water and wastewater services to our local governmental customers as well as the governmental entities’ end-use customers.
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Although we have exclusive long-term water and wastewater service contracts for 24,000 acres of the 27,000-acre Lowry Range pursuant to the Lowry Service Agreement, providing water and wastewater services to areas other than Wild Pointe, Sky Ranch and a portion of the Lowry Range is subject to competition. Alternate sources of water are available, principally from other private parties, such as farmers or others owning water rights that have historically been used for agriculture, and from municipalities seeking to annex new development areas in order to increase their tax base. Our principal competition in areas close to the Lowry Range is the City of Aurora. Principal factors affecting competition for potential purchasers of our Export Water include the availability of water for the particular purpose, the cost of delivering the water to the desired location (including the cost of required taps), and the reliability of the water supply during drought periods. We estimate that the water assets we own and have the exclusive right to use have a supply capacity of approximately 60,000 SFE units, and we believe that they provide us with a significant competitive advantage along the Front Range. Our legal rights to the Rangeview Water Supply have been confirmed for municipal use, and our water supply is close to Denver area water users. We believe that our pricing structure is competitive and that our water portfolio is well balanced among surface water rights, groundwater rights, storage capacity and reclaimed water supplies.

Land Development
 
Land development is a highly competitive business. There are numerous land developers, as well as properties and development projects, in the same geographic area in which Sky Ranch is located. Competition among land developers and development projects is determined by the location of the real estate, the market appeal of the development plan, and the developer’s ability to build, market and deliver projects on a timely basis. Many of our land development competitors have greater financial resources than we do, and most if not all of our land development competitors have more development experience than we do. Residential developers sell to home builders, who in turn compete based on location, price, market segmentation, product design and reputation. Commercial, retail, and industrial developers sell to and/or compete with other developers, owners and operators of real estate.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
 
Provision of water and wastewater services is subject to regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, related state laws, and federal and state regulations issued under these laws. These laws and regulations establish criteria and standards for drinking water and for wastewater discharges. In addition, we are subject to federal and state laws and other regulations relating to solid waste disposal and certain other aspects of our operations.
 
Environmental compliance issues may arise in the normal course of operations or as a result of regulatory changes. We attempt to align capital budgeting and expenditures to address these issues in a timely manner.
 
Safe Drinking Water Act – The Safe Drinking Water Act establishes criteria and procedures for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to develop national quality standards for drinking water. Regulations issued pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act and its amendments set standards on the amount of certain microbial and chemical contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water. The State of Colorado has assumed primary responsibility for enforcing the standards established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and has adopted the Colorado Primary Drinking Water Standards (Code of Colorado Regulations 5 CCR 1003-1). Current requirements for drinking water are not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations as we have made and are making investments to meet existing water quality standards. In the future, we might be required to change our method of treating drinking water and make additional capital investments if additional regulations become effective.
 
The federal Groundwater Rule became effective December 1, 2009. This rule requires additional testing of water from well sources and under certain circumstances requires demonstration and maintenance of effective disinfection. In 2009, Colorado adopted Article 13 to the Colorado Primary Drinking Water Standards to establish monitoring and compliance criteria for the Groundwater Rule. We have implemented measures to comply with the Groundwater Rule.
 
Clean Water Act – The Clean Water Act regulates wastewater discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities and storm water discharges into lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands. The State of Colorado has assumed primary responsibility for enforcing the standards established by the federal Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from domestic water and wastewater treatment facilities and has adopted the Colorado Water Quality Control Act and related regulations, which also regulate discharges to groundwater. It is our policy to obtain and maintain all required permits and approvals for discharges from our water and wastewater facilities and to comply with all conditions of those permits and other regulatory requirements. A program is in place to monitor facilities for compliance with permitting, monitoring and reporting for wastewater discharges. From time to time, discharge violations might occur which might result in fines and penalties, but we have no reason to believe that any such fines or penalties are pending or will be assessed.
 
In the future, we anticipate changing our method of treating wastewater, which will require future additional capital investments, as additional regulations become effective. In 2016, we invested $368,600 to design, permit and construct a 13 million gallon effluent storage reservoir at our wastewater treatment facility and have converted our facility to a zero discharge treatment facility. We are storing the treated effluent water and expect to use the water for agricultural and irrigation uses.
 
Solid Waste Disposal – The handling and disposal of residuals and solid waste generated from water and wastewater treatment facilities is governed by federal and state laws and regulations. We have a program in place to monitor our facilities for compliance with regulatory requirements, and we do not anticipate that costs associated with our handling and disposal of waste material from our water and wastewater operations will have a material impact on our business or financial condition.
Employees
 
We currently have 29 full-time employees.
