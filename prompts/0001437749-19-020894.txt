ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
FactSet Research Systems Inc. (the “Company” or “FactSet”) is a global provider of integrated financial information, analytical applications and industry-leading services for the investment and corporate communities. For over 40 years, global financial professionals have utilized our content and multi-asset class solutions across each stage of the investment process. Our goal is to provide a seamless user experience spanning idea generation, research, portfolio construction, trade execution, performance measurement, risk management, reporting, and portfolio analysis, in which we serve the front, middle, and back offices to drive productivity and improved performance. Our flexible, open data and technology solutions can be implemented both across the investment portfolio lifecycle or as standalone components serving different workflows in the organization. We are focused on growing our business throughout each of our three segments, the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific. We primarily deliver insight and information through the workflow solutions of Research, Analytics and Trading, Content and Technology Solutions and Wealth.
 
We currently serve financial professionals, which include portfolio managers, investment research professionals, investment bankers, risk and performance analysts, wealth advisors, and corporate clients. We provide both insights on global market trends and intelligence on companies and industries, as well as capabilities to monitor portfolio risk and performance and to execute trades. We combine dedicated client service with open and flexible technology offerings, such as a comprehensive data marketplace, a configurable mobile and desktop platform, digital portals and application programming interface (“APIs”). Our revenue is primarily derived from subscriptions to products and services such as workstations, analytics, enterprise data, research management, and trade execution.
 
Corporate History
 
FactSet was founded in 1978 and has been publicly held since 1996. We are dual listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “FDS.” Fiscal 2019 marked our 41st year of operations and while much has changed in the market and in technology, our focus has always been to provide best-in-class products and exceptional client service.

The following timeline depicts the Company’s history since our founding in 1978:
 


Business Strategy
 
As a premier financial solutions provider for the global financial community, we provide workflow solutions and leading analytical applications across the investment lifecycle to create an open and scalable platform. We bring the front, middle and back offices together to drive productivity and performance throughout the portfolio lifecycle. Our strategy is focused on growing our business throughout each of our three segments, the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific. We believe this geographical strategy alignment helps us better manage our resources and concentrate on markets that demand our products. To execute on our strategy of broad-based growth across each geographical segment, we continue to look at ways to create value for our clients by offering data, products and analytical applications within our workflow solutions of Research, Analytics and Trading, Wealth, and Content and Technology Solutions.
Research Solutions
 
Our Research Solutions workflow (“Research”) focuses on company analysis, idea generation, and research management. The tools within Research provide solutions to analyze public and private companies, generate ideas and discover opportunities with our proprietary data. Research also allows users to monitor the global markets, to gain industry and market insights, and to collaborate on and share information across teams. FactSet combines the global coverage, deep history, and transparency with over 1,000 FactSet-sourced and third-party databases integrated in one flexible platform.
 
  4 



Analytics and Trading Solutions
 
Our Analytics and Trading Solutions workflow (“Analytics and Trading”) addresses processes around portfolio analytics, risk management and performance measurement and attribution. Analytics and Trading also focuses on client reporting, portfolio construction, trade execution and order management. The applications within Analytics and Trading are modularized and deployed to fulfill both targeted and holistic needs in the front and middle offices. Analytics and Trading integrates our clients’ proprietary data along with FactSet and third-party content to bring actionable insights to the portfolio management process. Analytics and Trading tools are accessible through a variety of mediums, including the FactSet workstation and application programming interfaces.
Wealth Solutions
 
Our Wealth Solutions workflow (“Wealth”) is specific to the wealth management industry and creates offerings that enable wealth professionals across an entire enterprise, including home office, advisory, and client engagement. Wealth empowers wealth managers to demonstrate value to clients and prospects while protecting and growing their assets with FactSet’s combined solution set of portfolio analytics, market monitoring tools, multi-asset class research and customized client facing digital solutions. Our Research Management Solutions products enable our wealth management clients to increase collaboration and communication between Home Office and Advisory functions within the firm and deliver consistent and scalable messaging to the clients of the advisor.
Content and Technology Solutions
 
Our Content and Technology Solutions workflow (“CTS”) is focused on delivering value to our clients in the way they want to consume it. Our goal is to reduce the number of customizations by standardizing and bundling our proprietary data into data feeds. Whether a client needs market, company, or alternative data, our data delivery services provide normalized data through APIs and a direct delivery of local copies of standard data feeds. Our symbology links and aggregates a variety of content sources to ensure consistency, transparency, and data integrity across a client’s business.
 
FactSet Clients
 
Buy-side
 
As buy-side clients continue to shift towards multi-asset class investment strategies, we are positioned to be a partner in the space, given our ability to provide enterprise-wide solutions across their entire workflow. We provide solutions across asset classes and at nearly every stage of the investment process by utilizing our workstations, analytics, proprietary content, data feeds and portfolio services. Buy-side clients include portfolio managers, analysts, traders, wealth managers, performance teams and risk and compliance teams at a variety of firms, such as traditional asset managers, wealth advisors, corporations, hedge funds, insurance companies, plan sponsors and fund of funds.
 
The buy-side annual subscription value (“ASV”) growth rate for fiscal 2019 was 4.8%. Buy-side clients accounted for 83.7% of ASV as of August 31, 2019.
 
Sell-side
 
FactSet delivers comprehensive solutions to sell-side clients including workstation, proprietary and third-party content, productivity tools for Microsoft® Office, FactSet Web and Mobile, and FactSet Partners for research authoring and publishing. Our focus remains on expanding the depth of content offered and increasing workflow efficiency for investment banking, private equity, corporate and research firms.
 
The sell-side ASV growth rate for fiscal 2019 was 6.3%. Sell-side clients accounted for 16.3% of ASV as of August 31, 2019.
 
Client Subscription Growth
 
During fiscal 2019, we added 432 net new clients, increasing the number of clients by 8.4% over the prior year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we changed our client count definition to include clients from the April 2017 acquisition of FDSG. The prior year client count was not restated to reflect this change. We added 34,925 net new users during fiscal 2019, leading to a healthy progression in the number of users in both our buy-side and sell-side clients.
 
  5 



ASV Growth
 
ASV at any given point in time represents the forward-looking revenue for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients and excludes professional service fees, which are not subscription-based. Organic ASV excludes ASV from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months, and the effects of foreign currency, and professional services fees.
 
As of August 31, 2019, ASV was $1.46 billion, up from $1.39 billion a year ago. As of August 31, 2019, organic ASV was $1.46 billion, up $70.2 million or 5.0% from a year ago. This increase in organic ASV was due to growth across all of our geographic segments with the majority of growth in the U.S., followed by Asia Pacific and Europe. ASV growth from our workflow solutions was primarily driven by Analytics and Trading, CTS and Wealth.
 
The following chart provides a snapshot of FactSet’s historic ASV growth:
 

Financial Information on Geographic Areas
 
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that have the following characteristics: (i) it engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, (ii) its operating results are regularly reviewed by the company’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and (iii) its discrete financial information is available. Executive management, along with the CEO, constitute our chief operating decision making group (“CODMG”). Executive management consists of certain executives who directly report to the CEO, consisting of the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology and Product Officer, Global Head of Sales and Client Solutions, General Counsel, Chief Human Resources Officer and Head of Analytics and Trading. The CODMG reviews financial information at the operating segment level and is responsible for making decisions about resources allocated amongst the operating segments based on actual results.
 
  6 



Our operating segments are aligned with how the Company, including its CODMG, manages the business and the demographic markets in which it serves. Our internal financial reporting structure is based on three segments: the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific. We believe this alignment helps to better manage the business and serve client needs, as each segment requires financial and economic information specific to their respective markets. Our primary functional groups within the U.S., Europe, and Asia Pacific segments include sales, consulting, data collection, product development and software engineering, which provide global financial and economic information to investment managers, investment banks and other financial services professionals.
 
The U.S. segment serves investment professionals, including financial institutions throughout the Americas. The Europe and Asia Pacific segments serve investment professionals located throughout Europe and Asia Pacific, respectively. Financial information, including revenues, operating income and long-lived assets related to our operations in each geographic area are presented in Note 8, Segment Information, and in the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
 
The U.S. segment has offices in 15 locations, within 13 states throughout the U.S., including our corporate headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut, as well as two additional offices located in Brazil and Canada. The European segment maintains office locations in Bulgaria, UAE (Dubai), England, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, and Switzerland. The Asia Pacific segment has office locations in Australia, Hong Kong, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, and Singapore. Segment revenue reflects direct sales to clients based in their respective geographic locations. Each segment records compensation expense (including stock-based compensation), amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of furniture and fixtures, amortization of leasehold improvements, communication costs, professional fees, rent expense, travel, office and other direct expenses.
 
Expenditures associated with our data centers, third-party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the U.S. segment and are not allocated to the other segments. The content collection centers, located in India, the Philippines, and Latvia, benefit all our operating segments, and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenue.
 
The following charts depict revenue related to our reportable segments.
 
 

Talent
 
We have built a collaborative culture that recognizes and rewards innovation and offers employees a variety of opportunities and experiences. Our employees are critical to our success and are the reason we continue to execute at a high level. We believe our continued focus on making employee engagement a top priority will help us provide high quality insights and information to clients globally.
 
As of August 31, 2019, our employee headcount was 9,681, an increase of 1.1% in the last twelve months. Of our total employees, 2,351 are in the U.S., 1,282 in Europe and 6,048 in the Asia Pacific segment. In order to optimize productivity, we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in India and the Philippines, where we now have a combined workforce of approximately 5,800 people. As of August 31, 2019, approximately 430 FactSet employees within certain French and German subsidiaries were represented by mandatory works councils, an amount consistent with fiscal 2018. No other employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.
 
  7 



In December 2018, we appointed Daniel Viens as Chief Human Resources Officer. In May 2019, we announced that John W. Wiseman, the Company’s Global Head of Sales and Client Solutions, would step down from his position on June 1, 2019, remaining at the company until August 31, 2019 to assist during the transition. In the same announcement, effective June 1, 2019, we appointed Franck A.R. Gossieaux as the Company's new Global Head of Sales and Client Solutions.
 
Third-Party Content
 
We aggregate content from over 1,000 third-party data suppliers, news sources, exchanges, brokers and contributors into our own dedicated single online service, which the client accesses to perform their analysis. We license content from premier providers of major global exchanges and data providers. We seek to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each major type of financial data, though certain data sets on which we rely have a limited number of suppliers. We make every effort to assure that, where reasonable, alternative sources are available. We are not dependent on any one third-party data supplier in order to meet the needs of our clients. We have entered into third-party content agreements of varying lengths, which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice, at predefined dates, and in other cases on shorter notice. No single vendor or data supplier represented more than 10% of FactSet's total data costs during fiscal 2019, with the exception for one vendor, which is a supplier of risk models and portfolio optimizer data to FactSet and represented 11% of FactSet’s data costs in fiscal 2019.
 
Data Centers
 
Our business is dependent on our ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on our networks and systems. Our global technology infrastructure supports our operations and is designed to facilitate the reliable and efficient processing and delivery of data and analytics to our clients. Our data centers contain multiple layers of redundancy to enhance system performance, including maintaining, processing and storing data at multiple data centers. User connections are load balanced between data centers. In the event of a site failure, equipment problem or localized disaster, the remaining centers have the capacity to handle the additional load. We continue to be focused on maintaining a global technological infrastructure that allows us to support our growing business.
 
We are embarking on a set of programs that will increasingly move our systems and applications to cloud computing platforms. We continue to operate fully redundant data centers in both Virginia and New Jersey in the U.S. that can handle our entire client capacity. In addition, select workloads are migrating to diverse cloud computing regions utilizing premier, market-leading Cloud providers.
 
The Competitive Landscape
 
We are a part of the financial information services industry, providing accurate financial information and workflow solutions to the global investment community. This extremely competitive market is comprised of both large, well-capitalized companies and smaller, niche firms including market data suppliers, news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply us with financial information included in the FactSet workstation. Our largest competitors are Bloomberg L.P., Refinitiv (formerly part of Thomson Reuters), and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Other competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications, such as MSCI Inc., Morningstar Inc., BlackRock Solutions and RIMES Technologies Corporation. Many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those we sell. Our development of robust sets of proprietary content combined with our news and quotes offering have resulted in more direct competition with the largest financial data providers.
 
Despite competing products and services, we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer. Through our in-depth analytics and client service, we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities, through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed. In addition, our applications, including our client support and service offerings, are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysis/screening capabilities offered. We are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients' own proprietary data, including portfolio holdings. As a result, our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decision-making.

Intellectual Property
 
We have registered trademarks and copyrights for many of our products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, clients, data suppliers and vendors. We seek to protect our workflow solutions, documentation and other written materials under trade secret, copyright and patent laws. While we do not believe we are dependent on any one of our intellectual property rights, we do rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. Despite these efforts, existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection.
Research and Product Development Costs
 
A key aspect of our growth strategy is to enhance our existing products and applications by making them faster with more reliable data. We strive to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve our products and services. At FactSet we do not have a separate research and product development department, but rather our product development and engineering departments work closely with our strategists, product managers, sales and other client-facing specialists to identify areas of improvement to provide increased value to our clients. Research and product development costs relate to the salary and benefits for our product development, software engineering and technical support staff. These costs are expensed as incurred within our cost of services as employee compensation. We intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements that will allow us to respond quickly to market changes and efficiently meet the needs of our clients. We incurred research and product development costs of $214.7 million, $217.1 million and $215.0 million during fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
