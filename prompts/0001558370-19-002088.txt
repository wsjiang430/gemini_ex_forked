 The principal business of Republic is directing, planning, and coordinating the business activities of the Bank. The financial condition and results of operations of Republic are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of the Bank. At December 31, 2018, Republic had total assets of $5.2 billion, total deposits of $3.5 billion, and total stockholders’ equity of $690 million. Based on total assets as of December 31, 2018, Republic ranked as the largest Kentucky-based financial holding company. The executive offices of Republic are located at 601 West Market Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, telephone number (502) 584-3600. The Company’s website address is www.republicbank.com.      Website Access to Reports
     The Company makes its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, available free of charge through its website, www.republicbank.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. The information provided on the Company’s website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference, unless that information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report. The SEC maintains an internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.      General Business Overview
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company was divided into five reportable segments: Traditional Banking, Warehouse, Mortgage Banking, TRS, and RCS. Management considers the first three segments to collectively constitute “Core Bank” or “Core Banking” operations, while the last two segments collectively constitute RPG operations. The Bank’s Correspondent Lending channel and the Company’s national branchless banking platform, MemoryBank®, are considered part of the Traditional Banking segment.      (I)  Traditional Banking segment
     As of December 31, 2018 and through the date of this filing, generally all Traditional Banking products and services, except for a selection of deposit products offered through the Bank’s separately branded national branchless banking platform, MemoryBank, were offered through the Company’s traditional RB&T brand.      Lending Activities
     The Bank’s principal lending activities consist of the following:
     Retail Mortgage Lending — Through its retail banking centers, its Correspondent Lending channel and its Internet Banking channel, the Bank originates single family, residential real estate loans. In addition, the Bank originates HEALs and HELOCs through its retail banking centers. Such loans are generally collateralized by owner occupied property. During 2018, the Bank changed the marketing of its HELOCs, still utilizing a promotional rate product, but charging a nominal level of closing costs. Under the terms of the promotional product during 2018, clients received a fixed interest rate for 12 months at the prevailing Prime Rate minus 0.25% (at time of application). At the expiration of the promotional rate period, rates are adjusted to an index based on Prime. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Bank reverted to a no closing costs promotion as a result of decreased volume throughout the first half of the year, coupled with an increased interest rate environment.
     For those loans originated through the Bank’s retail banking centers, the collateral is predominately located in the Bank’s market footprint, while loans originated through the Correspondent Lending and Internet Banking channels are generally secured by owner occupied collateral located outside of the Bank’s market footprint. 
     The Bank offers single family, first lien residential real estate, ARMs with interest rate adjustments tied to various market indices with specified minimum and maximum adjustments. The Bank generally charges a higher interest rate for its ARMs if the property is not owner occupied. The interest rates on the majority of ARMs are adjusted after their fixed rate periods on an annual basis, with most having annual and lifetime limitations on upward rate adjustments to the loan. These loans typically feature amortization periods of up to 30 years and have fixed interest rate periods generally ranging from five to ten years, with demand dependent upon market conditions. In general, ARMs containing longer fixed rate periods have historically been more attractive to the Bank’s clients in a relatively low rate environment, while ARMs with shorter fixed rate periods have historically 

 
  6

 
been more attractive to the Bank’s clients in a relatively high rate environment. While there is no requirement for clients to refinance their loans at the end of the fixed rate period, clients have historically done so the majority of the time, as most clients are interest rate risk averse on their first mortgage loans.
     Depending on the term and amount of the ARM, loans collateralized by single family, owner-occupied first lien residential real estate may be originated with an LTV up to 90% and a combined LTV up to 100%. The Bank also offers a 100% LTV product for home purchase transactions within its primary markets. The Bank does not require the borrower to obtain private mortgage insurance for ARM loans. Except for the HEAL product under $150,000, the Bank requires mortgagee’s title insurance on single family, first lien residential real estate loans to protect the Bank against defects in its liens on the properties that collateralize the loans. The Bank normally requires title, fire, and extended casualty insurance to be obtained by the borrower and, when required by applicable regulations, flood insurance. The Bank maintains an errors and omissions insurance policy to protect the Bank against loss in the event a borrower fails to maintain proper fire and other hazard insurance policies.
     Single family, first lien residential ARMs originated prior to January 10, 2014 generally contain an early termination penalty. Effective January 10, 2014, with the implementation of the ATR Rule, the Bank eliminated early termination penalties for subsequently originated ARMs.
     Single family, first lien residential real estate loans with fixed rate periods of 15, 20, and 30 years are primarily sold into the secondary market. MSRs attached to the sold portfolio are either sold along with the loan or retained. Loans sold into the secondary market, along with their corresponding MSRs, are included as a component of the Company’s Mortgage Banking segment, as discussed elsewhere in this filing. The Bank, as it has in the past, may retain such longer-term fixed rate loans from time to time in the future to help combat market compression. Any such loans retained on balance sheet would be reported as a component of the Traditional Banking segment.
     The Bank does, on occasion, purchase single family, first lien residential real estate loans made to low-to-moderate income borrowers and/or secured by property located in low-to-moderate income areas in order to meet its obligations under the CRA. In connection with loan purchases, the Bank receives various representations and warranties from the sellers regarding the quality and characteristics of the loans. 
     Commercial Lending — The Bank conducts commercial lending activities primarily through Corporate Banking, Commercial Lending, Business Banking, and Retail Banking channels.
     In general, commercial lending credit approvals and processing are prepared and underwritten through the Bank’s CCAD. Clients are generally located within the Bank’s market footprint, or in an adjacent area to the market footprint. 
     Credit opportunities are generally driven by the following: companies expanding their businesses; companies acquiring new businesses; and/or companies refinancing existing debt from other institutions. The Bank has a focus on C&I lending and CRE lending, specifically owner occupied. The targeted C&I credit size for client relationships is typically between $2 million to $10 million, with higher targets, $10 million to $25 million for large Corporate Banking borrowers of higher credit quality. 
     C&I loans typically include those secured by general business assets, which consist of equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, and other business assets owned by the borrower/guarantor. Credit facilities include annually renewable lines of credit and term loans with maturities typically from three to five years and may also involve financial covenant requirements. These requirements are monitored by the Bank’s CCAD. Underwriting for C&I loans is based on the borrower’s capacity to repay these loans from operating cash flows, typically measured by EBITDA, with capital strength, collateral and management experience also important underwriting considerations. 
     Corporate Banking focuses on larger C&I and CRE opportunities. For CRE loans, Corporate Banking focuses on stabilized CRE with low leverage and strong cash flows. Borrowers are generally single-asset entities and loan sizes typically range from $10 million to $25 million. Primary underwriting considerations are property cash flow (current and historical), quality of leases, financial capacity of sponsors, and collateral value of property financed. The majority of interest rates offered are based on LIBOR; however, this is expected to change in the coming years when LIBOR is discontinued. Fixed rate terms of up to 10 years are available to borrowers by utilizing interest rate swaps. In some cases, limited or non-recourse (of owners) loans will be issued, with such cases based upon the capital position, cash flows, and stabilization of the borrowing entity.

     Commercial Lending focuses on medium size C&I and CRE opportunities. Borrowers are generally single-asset entities and loan sizes typically range from $5 million to $10 million. As with Corporate Banking, the primary underwriting considerations are property cash flow (current and historical), quality of leases, financial capacity of sponsors, and collateral value of property financed. Interest rates offered are based on both fixed and variable interest rate formulas. 
     The Bank’s CRE and multi-family loans are typically secured by improved property such as office buildings, medical facilities, retail centers, warehouses, apartment buildings, condominiums, schools, religious institutions and other types of commercial use property.
     The Business Banking Department, and to some extent the Bank’s Retail Banking group, focuses on locally based small-to-medium sized businesses in the Bank’s market footprint with annual revenues between $1 million and $20 million, and borrowings between $2 million and $5 million. The needs of these clients range from expansion or acquisition financing, equipment financing, owner-occupied real estate financing, and operating lines of credit. The Bank’s lenders utilize all appropriate programs of the SBA to reduce credit risk exposure. In 2018, the Bank became an SBA Preferred Lending Partner, which allows the Bank to underwrite and approve its own SBA loans in an expedited manner. Additionally, the Bank looks to make loans to real estate investors for various types of investment properties, including rental homes and apartments, shopping centers, office buildings, and loans to various not-for-profit agencies located within the Bank’s market footprint. The targeted credit size for a relationship in this area is between $500,000 and $5 million. 
     Construction and Land Development Lending — To a lesser extent, the Bank originates business loans for the construction of both single-family residential properties and commercial properties (apartment complexes, shopping centers, office buildings). While not a focus for the Bank, the Bank may originate loans for the acquisition and development of residential or commercial land into buildable lots. 
     Single family residential construction loans are made in the Bank’s market area to established homebuilders with solid financial records. The majority of these loans are made for “contract” homes, which the builder has already pre-sold to a homebuyer. The duration of these loans is generally less than 12 months and repaid at the end of the construction period from the sale of the constructed property. Some loans are made on “speculative” homes, which the builder does not have pre-sold to a homebuyer but expects to execute a contract to sell during the construction period. These speculative homes are considered necessary to have in inventory for homebuilders, as not all homebuyers want to wait during the construction period to purchase and move into a newly built home. Generally, the Bank will require a larger amount of equity from the builder when financing a speculative home compared to a contract home due to the increased risk of failing to sell the underlying property in a reasonable period. 
     Commercial construction loans are made in the Bank’s market to established commercial builders with solid financial records. Typically, these loans are made for investment properties and have tenants pre-committed for some or all of the space. Some projects may begin as speculative, with the builder contracting to lease or sell the property during the construction period. Generally, commercial construction loans are made for the duration of the construction period and slightly beyond and will either convert to permanent financing with the Bank or with another lender at or before maturity. 
     Construction-to-permanent loans are another type of construction-related financing offered by the Bank. These loans are made to borrowers who are going to build a property and retain it for ownership after construction completion. The construction phase is handled just like all other construction loans, and the permanent phase offers similar terms to a permanent CRE loan, while allowing the borrower a one-time closing process at loan origination. These loans are offered on both owners occupied and non-owner occupied CRE properties.
     Consumer Direct Lending — Through its Consumer Direct Lending channel, formerly named its Internet Lending channel, the Bank accepts online loan applications for its RB&T branded products through its website at www.republicbank.com. Historically, the majority of loans originated through its Consumer Direct Lending channel have been within the Bank’s traditional markets of Kentucky, Florida and Indiana. Other states where loans are marketed include Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Virginia, as well as, the District of Columbia.

 Correspondent Lending — Primarily from its Warehouse clients, the Bank may occasionally acquire for investment single family, first lien mortgage loans that meet the Bank’s specifications through its Correspondent Lending channel. Substantially all loans purchased through the Correspondent Lending channel are purchased at a premium. The volume of loans purchased through the Correspondent Lending channel may fluctuate from time to time based on several factors, including, but not limited to, borrower demand, other investment options and the Bank’s current and forecasted liquidity position.
     Consumer Lending — Traditional Banking consumer loans made by the Bank include home improvement and home equity loans, other secured and unsecured personal loans, and credit cards. Except for home equity loans, which are actively marketed in conjunction with single family, first lien residential real estate loans, other Traditional Banking consumer loan products (not including products offered through Republic Processing Group), while available, are not and have not been actively promoted in the Bank’s markets.
     Dealer Services — The Bank offers dealer-floor-plan loans and consumer-indirect automobile loans through its Dealer Services Department. Dealer-floor-plan loans are commercial lines of credit to automobile dealers secured by the dealer’s current inventory of vehicles, typically in or around the Bank’s market footprint. The Indirect Automobile program involves establishing relationships with automobile dealers and obtaining consumer automobile loans in a low-cost delivery method.
     Aircraft Lending — Also included in the Bank’s Dealer Services Department is the Aircraft Lending Division. First offered by the Bank in October 2017, aircraft loans typically range in amounts from $55,000 to $1,000,000, with terms up to 20 years, to purchase or refinance a piston aircraft (non-jet aircraft), along with engine overhauls and avionic upgrades. The aircraft loan program is open to all states, except for Alaska and Hawaii.

      The Bank’s other Traditional Banking activities generally consist of the following:
     MemoryBank — In October 2016, the Bank opened the “digital doors” of MemoryBank, a national branchless banking platform. MemoryBank is a separately branded division of the Bank, which from a marketing perspective, focuses on technologically savvy clients that prefer to carry larger balances in highly liquid interest-bearing bank accounts.
     Private Banking — The Bank provides financial products and services to high net worth individuals through its Private Banking department. The Bank’s Private Banking officers have extensive banking experience and are trained to meet the unique financial needs of this clientele.
     Treasury Management Services — The Bank provides various deposit products designed for commercial business clients located throughout its market footprint. Lockbox processing, remote deposit capture, business on-line banking, account reconciliation, and ACH processing are additional services offered to commercial businesses through the Bank’s Treasury Management department.
     Internet Banking — The Bank expands its market penetration and service delivery of its RB&T brand by offering clients Internet Banking services and products through its website, www.republicbank.com. 
     Mobile Banking — The Bank allows clients to easily and securely access and manage their accounts through its mobile banking application.
     Other Banking Services — The Bank also provides title insurance and other financial institution-related products and services.
     Bank Acquisitions — The Bank maintains an acquisition strategy to selectively grow its franchise as a complement to its organic growth strategies.

     (II)  Warehouse Lending segment
     Through its Warehouse Lending segment, the Core Bank provides short-term, revolving credit facilities to mortgage bankers across the United States through mortgage warehouse lines of credit. These credit facilities are primarily secured by single family, first lien residential real estate loans. The credit facility enables the mortgage banking clients to close single family, first lien residential real estate loans in their own name and temporarily fund their inventory of these closed loans until the loans are sold to investors approved by the Bank. Individual loans are expected to remain on the warehouse line for an average of 15 to 30 days. Reverse mortgage loans typically remain on the line longer than conventional mortgage loans. Interest income and loan fees are accrued for each individual loan during the time the loan remains on the warehouse line and collected when the loan is sold. The Core Bank receives the sale proceeds of each loan directly from the investor and applies the funds to pay off the warehouse advance and related accrued interest and fees. The remaining proceeds are credited to the mortgage-banking client.
     See additional discussion regarding the Warehouse Lending segment under Footnote 24 “Segment Information” of Part II Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
     (III)  Mortgage Banking segment
     Mortgage Banking activities primarily include 15-, 20- and 30-year fixed-term single family, first lien residential real estate loans that are sold into the secondary market, primarily to the FHLMC and the FNMA. The Bank typically retains servicing on loans sold into the secondary market. Administration of loans with servicing retained by the Bank includes collecting principal and interest payments, escrowing funds for property taxes and property insurance, and remitting payments to secondary market investors. A fee is received by the Bank for performing these standard servicing functions.
     As part of the sale of loans with servicing retained, the Bank records MSRs. MSRs represent an estimate of the present value of future cash servicing income, net of estimated costs, which the Bank expects to receive on loans sold with servicing retained by the Bank. MSRs are capitalized as separate assets. This transaction is posted to net gain on sale of loans, a component of “Mortgage Banking income” in the income statement. Management considers all relevant factors, in addition to pricing considerations from other servicers, to estimate the fair value of the MSRs to be recorded when the loans are initially sold with servicing retained by the Bank. The carrying value of MSRs is initially amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period of net servicing income and subsequently adjusted quarterly based on the weighted average remaining life of the underlying loans. The MSR amortization is recorded as a reduction to net servicing income, a component of Mortgage Banking income.
     With the assistance of an independent third party, the MSRs asset is reviewed at least quarterly for impairment based on the fair value of the MSRs using groupings of the underlying loans based on predominant risk characteristics. Any impairment of a grouping is reported as a valuation allowance. A primary factor influencing the fair value is the estimated life of the underlying loans serviced. The estimated life of the loans serviced is significantly influenced by market interest rates. During a period of declining interest rates, the fair value of the MSRs is expected to decline due to increased anticipated prepayment speeds within the portfolio. Alternatively, during a period of rising interest rates, the fair value of MSRs would be expected to increase, as prepayment speeds on the underlying loans would be expected to decline.
     See additional discussion regarding the Mortgage Banking segment under Footnote 24 “Segment Information” of Part II Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

 (IV) Tax Refund Solutions segment
 Through the TRS segment, the Bank is one of a limited number of financial institutions that facilitates the receipt and payment of federal and state tax refund products and offers a credit product through third-party tax preparers located throughout the United States, as well as tax-preparation software providers (collectively, the “Tax Providers”). Substantially all of the business generated by the TRS segment occurs in the first half of the year. The TRS segment traditionally operates at a loss during the second half of the year, during which time the segment incurs costs preparing for the upcoming year’s tax season. 
 RTs are fee-based products whereby a tax refund is issued to the taxpayer after the Bank has received the refund from the federal or state government. There is no credit risk or borrowing cost associated with these products because they are only delivered to the taxpayer upon receipt of the tax refund directly from the governmental paying authority. Fees earned by the Company on RTs, net of revenue share, are reported as noninterest income under the line item “Net refund transfer fees.”
 The EA tax credit product is a loan that allows a taxpayer to borrow funds as an advance of a portion of their tax refund. First offered by TRS in 2016, the EA had the following features during its 2018, 2017, and 2016 offering periods:  
     Offered only during the first two months of each year;

· | No EA fee was charged to the taxpayer customer;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | All fees for the EA were paid by the Tax Providers with a restriction prohibiting the Tax Providers from passing along the fees to the taxpayer customer;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No requirement that the taxpayer customer pays for another bank product, such as an RT;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Multiple funds disbursement methods, including direct deposit, prepaid card, check, or Walmart Direct2Cash®, based on the taxpayer-customer’s election;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Repayment of the EA to the Bank was deducted from the taxpayer customer’s tax refund proceeds; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | If an insufficient refund to repay the EA occurred:
--+----------------------------------------------------


o | there was no recourse to the taxpayer customer,
--+------------------------------------------------


o | no negative credit reporting on the taxpayer customer, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


o | no collection efforts against the taxpayer customer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

  The Company reports fees paid by the Tax Providers for the EA product as interest income on loans. EAs are generally repaid within three weeks after the taxpayer customer’s tax return is submitted to the applicable taxing authority. EAs do not have a contractual due date but the Company considers an EA delinquent if it remains unpaid three weeks after the taxpayer customer’s tax return is submitted to the applicable taxing authority. Provisions for loan losses on EAs are estimated when advances are made, with provisions for all probable EA losses made in the first quarter of each year. Unpaid EAs are charged-off within 111 days after the taxpayer customer’s tax return is submitted to the applicable taxing authority, with the majority of charge-offs typically recorded during the second quarter of the year.
     Related to the overall credit losses on EAs, the Bank’s ability to control losses is highly dependent upon its ability to predict the taxpayer’s likelihood to receive the tax refund as claimed on the taxpayer’s tax return. Each year, the Bank’s EA approval model is based primarily on the prior-year’s tax refund funding patterns. Because much of the loan volume occurs each year before that year’s tax refund funding patterns can be analyzed and subsequent underwriting changes made, credit losses during a current year could be higher than management’s predictions if tax refund funding patterns change materially between years. 
    
In response to changes in the legal, regulatory and competitive environment, management annually reviews and revises the EA’s product parameters. Further changes in EA product parameters do not ensure positive results and could have an overall material negative impact on the performance of the EA and therefore on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. For the first quarter 2019 tax season, the Company modified the EA product offering to increase the maximum advance amount and to also charge a direct fee to the taxpayer-customer. The annual percentage rate to the taxpayer for his or her portion of the EA fee is less than 36% for all EA offering amounts.

      Republic Payment Solutions division
     Through the RPS division of the TRS segment, the Bank is an issuing bank offering general-purpose-reloadable prepaid cards through third-party service providers. 
     For the projected near-term, as the prepaid card program matures, the operating results of the RPS division are expected to be immaterial to the Company’s overall results of operations and, as the majority of the cards issued are through TRS relationships, will be reported as part of the TRS segment. The RPS division will not be classified a separate reportable segment until such time, if any, that it meets reporting thresholds.

      (V) Republic Credit Solutions segment
     Through the RCS segment, the Bank offers consumer credit products. In general, the credit products are unsecured, small dollar consumer loans and are dependent on various factors including the consumer’s ability to repay. RCS loans typically earn a higher yield but also have higher credit risk compared to loans originated through the Traditional Banking segment, with a significant portion of RCS clients considered subprime or near-prime borrowers. Additional information regarding consumer loan products offered through RCS follows:
· | RCS line-of-credit product – The Bank originates a line-of-credit product to generally subprime borrowers across the United States through Elevate Credit, Inc., its third-party servicer provider. RCS sells 90% of the balances generated within two business days of loan origination to a special purpose entity related to Elevate Credit, Inc. and retains the remaining 10% interest. The line-of-credit product represents the substantial majority of RCS activity. Loan balances held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RCS credit-card product – From the fourth quarter of 2015 through the first quarter of 2018, the Bank piloted a credit-card product to generally subprime borrowers across the United States through one third-party marketer/servicer. For outstanding cards, RCS sold 90% of the balances generated within two business days of each transaction occurrence to a special purpose entity related to its third-party marketer/servicer and retained the remaining 10% interest. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Bank and its third-party marketer/servicer finalized an agreement to sell 100% of the existing portfolio to an unrelated third party. The sale of the RCS credit-card portfolio receivables was settled in January 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | RCS healthcare receivables product – The Bank originates a healthcare-receivables product across the United States through two different third-party service providers. For one third-party service provider, the Bank retains 100% of the receivables originated. For the other third-party service provider, the Bank retains 100% of the receivables originated in some instances, and in other instances, sells 100% of the receivables within one month of origination. Loan balances held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | RCS installment loan product – From the first quarter of 2016 through the first quarter of 2018, the Bank piloted a consumer installment-loan product across the United States using a third-party marketer/service. As part of the program, the Bank sold 100% of the balances generated through the program back to the third-party marketer/servicer approximately 21 days after origination. The Bank carried all unsold loans under the program as “held for sale” on its balance sheet. At the initiation of this program in 2016, the Bank elected to carry these loans at fair value under a fair-value option, with the portfolio thereafter marked to market monthly.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      During the second quarter of 2018, the Bank and its third-party marketer/service provider suspended the origination of any new loans, and the subsequent sale of all recently originated loans under this program, while the two parties evaluated the future offering of this product due to changes in the applicable state law impacting the product. Concurrent with the suspension of this program, the Bank reclassified approximately $2.2 million of these loans from held for sale on the balance sheet into the held-for-investment category and revalued these loans accordingly.
     The Company reports interest income and loan origination fees earned on RCS loans under “Loans, including fees,” while any gains or losses on sale and mark-to-market adjustments of RCS loans are reported as noninterest income under “Program fees.”

 Competition
     Traditional Banking
     The Traditional Bank encounters intense competition in its market footprint in originating loans, attracting deposits, and selling other banking related financial services. Through its national branchless banking platform, MemoryBank, the Bank competes for digital and mobile clients in select pilot markets under the MemoryBank brand. Through its Correspondent Lending channel, the Bank also competes to acquire newly originated mortgage loans from select mortgage companies on a national basis. The deregulation of the banking industry, the ability to create financial services holding companies to engage in a wide range of financial services other than banking and the widespread enactment of state laws that permit multi-bank holding companies, as well as the availability of nationwide interstate banking, has created a highly competitive environment for financial institutions. In one or more aspects of the Bank’s business, the Bank competes with local and regional retail and commercial banks, other savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage companies, fintech companies, and other financial intermediaries operating in Kentucky, Indiana, Florida, Tennessee, and Ohio and in other states where the Bank offers its products. The Bank also competes with insurance companies, consumer finance companies, investment banking firms and mutual fund managers. Some of the Company’s competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulatory review and restrictions that apply to the Company and the Bank. Many of the Bank’s primary competitors, some of which are affiliated with large bank holding companies or other larger financial based institutions, have substantially greater resources, larger established client bases, higher lending limits, more extensive banking center networks, numerous ATMs or ITMs, and greater advertising and marketing budgets. They may also offer services that the Bank does not currently provide. These competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix, pricing strategies and banking center locations. Legislative developments related to interstate branching and banking in general, by providing large banking institutions easier access to a broader marketplace, can act to create more pressure on smaller financial institutions to consolidate. It is anticipated that competition from both bank and non-bank entities will continue to remain strong in the foreseeable future.
     The primary factors in competing for bank products are convenient locations and ATMs, ITMs, flexible hours, deposit interest rates, services, internet banking, mobile banking, range of lending services offered, and lending fees. Additionally, the Bank believes that an emphasis on highly personalized service tailored to individual client needs, together with the local character of the Bank’s business and its “community bank” management philosophy will continue to enhance the Bank’s ability to compete successfully in its market footprint.
     Warehouse Lending
     The Bank competes with financial institutions across the United States for mortgage banking clients in need of warehouse lines of credit. Competitors may have substantially greater resources, larger established client bases, higher lending limits, as well as underwriting standards and on-going oversight requirements that could be viewed more favorably by some clients. A few or all of these factors can lead to a competitive disadvantage to the Company when attempting to retain or grow its Warehouse client base.     Mortgage Banking
     The Bank competes with mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, and financial institutions for the origination and funding of mortgage loans. Many competitors have branch offices in the same areas where the Bank’s loan officers operate. The Bank also competes with mortgage companies whose focus is often on telemarketing and Consumer Direct lending.     Tax Refund Solutions
     The TRS segment encounters direct competition for RT and EA market share from a limited number of banks in the industry. The Bank promotes these products to Tax Providers using various revenue-share and pricing incentives, as well as product features and overall service levels.     Republic Payment Solutions
     The prepaid card industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. The Bank competes with a number of companies that market different types of prepaid card products, such as general-purpose-reloadable, gift, incentive, and corporate disbursement cards. There is also competition from large retailers who are seeking to integrate more financial services into their product offerings. 

 
  14

 
Increased competition is also expected from alternative financial services providers who are often well-positioned to service the “underbanked” and who may wish to develop their own prepaid card programs.
     Republic Credit Solutions
     The small-dollar consumer loan industry is highly competitive. Competitors for the Company’s small-dollar loan programs include, but are not limited to, billers who accept late payments for a fee, overdraft privilege programs of other banks and credit unions, as well as payday lenders and fintech companies.
     New entrants to the small dollar consumer loan market must successfully implement underwriting and fraud prevention processes, overcome consumer brand loyalty, and have sufficient capital to withstand early losses associated with unseasoned loan portfolios. In addition, there are substantial regulatory and compliance costs, including the need for expertise to customize products associated with licenses to lend in various states across the United States.
     Supervision and Regulation 
     The Company and the Bank are separate and distinct entities and are subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations, which establish a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Company and the Bank may engage. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to provide protection to clients and depositors, not stockholders. 
     The Company is limited under the BHCA to banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking. The Company, a BHC, elected to become an FHC under the GLBA, allowing it to engage in a broader range of activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general. The FRB conducts periodic examinations to review the Company’s safety and soundness, and compliance with various legal and safety and soundness requirements. As an umbrella supervisor under the GLBA's system of functional regulation, the FRB requires that FHCs operate in a safe and sound manner so that their financial condition does not threaten the viability of affiliated depository institutions.
     The Bank is a Kentucky-chartered commercial banking and trust corporation and as such, it is subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and the KDFI. The Bank also operates physical locations in Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee; originates and purchases loans on a national basis; and accepts deposits on a national basis through its MemoryBank digital brand. All deposits, subject to regulatory prescribed limitations, held by the Bank are insured by the FDIC. The Bank is subject to restrictions, requirements, potential enforcement actions and examinations by the FDIC and KDFI. The FRB’s regulation of the Company with monetary policies and operational rules directly impact the Bank. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System. As a member of the FHLB system, the Bank must also comply with applicable regulations of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Regulation by each of these agencies is intended primarily for the protection of the Bank’s depositors and the DIF and not for the benefit of the Company’s stockholders. The Bank’s activities are also regulated under federal and state consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank’s lending, deposit, and other activities. An adverse ruling or finding against the Company or the Bank under these laws could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.
     The Company and the Bank are also subject to the regulations of the CFPB, which was established under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB has consolidated rules and orders with respect to consumer financial products and services and has substantial power to define the rights of consumers and responsibilities of lending institutions, such as the Bank. The CFPB does not, however, examine or supervise the Bank for compliance with such regulations; rather, based on the Bank’s size (less than $10 billion in assets), enforcement authority remains with the FDIC although the Bank may be required to submit reports or other materials to the CFPB upon its request. Notwithstanding jurisdictional limitations set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB and federal banking regulators may endeavor to work jointly in investigating and resolving cases as they arise.
     Regulators have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and examination policies, including, but not limited to, policies that can materially impact the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves. Any change in regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the FRB, the FDIC, the KDFI, the CFPB or state or federal legislation, could have a material adverse impact on Company operations.
    
 
  15

 

 Regulators also have broad enforcement powers over banks and their holding companies, including, but not limited to:  the power to mandate or restrict particular actions, activities, or divestitures; impose monetary fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations; issue cease and desist or removal orders; seek injunctions; publicly disclose such actions; and prohibit unsafe or unsound practices. This authority includes both informal and formal actions to effect corrective actions and/or sanctions. In addition, the Bank is subject to regulation and potential enforcement actions by other state and federal agencies.
     Certain regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are referred to below or elsewhere in this filing. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to banks and their holding companies set forth in this filing does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations. Their effect on the Company and the Bank is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations.
     The Dodd-Frank Act
     The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, implemented changes that affected the oversight and supervision of financial institutions, provided for a new resolution procedure for large financial companies, created the CFPB, introduced more stringent regulatory capital requirements and significant changes in the regulation of OTC derivatives, reformed the regulation of credit rating agencies, increased controls and transparency in corporate governance and executive compensation practices, incorporated the Volcker Rule, required registration of advisers to certain private funds, and influenced significant changes in the securitization market.
     The Dodd-Frank Act included provisions which restrict interchange fees to those which are “reasonable and proportionate” for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing (known as the “Durbin Amendment”). The Federal Reserve issued final rules implementing the Durbin Amendment on June 29, 2011. Notably, the interchange fee restrictions in the Durbin Amendment do not apply to the Bank because debit card issuers with total worldwide assets of less than $10 billion are exempt. 
     Incentive Compensation — In 2010, the FRB and other regulators jointly published final guidance for structuring incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations. The guidance does not set forth any formulas or pay caps but contains certain principles that companies are required to follow with respect to employees and groups of employees that may expose the company to material amounts of risk. The three primary principles are (i) balanced risk-taking incentives, (ii) compatibility with effective controls and risk management, and (iii) strong corporate governance. The FRB monitors compliance with this guidance as part of its safety and soundness oversight.
     In 2016, the FRB, SEC, and other regulators jointly published proposed rules on incentive compensation under Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rules are intended to (i) prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that the banking regulators determine could encourage certain financial institutions to take inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss, (ii) require the board of directors of those financial institutions to take certain oversight actions related to incentive-based compensation, and (iii) require those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate federal regulator. The Company and the Bank would be Level 3 covered institutions under the proposed rules because both have average total consolidated assets between $1 billion and $50 billion. As a Level 3 covered institution, the Company and the Bank would only be subject to the most basic set of prohibitions and requirements, which prohibit “excessive compensation, fees, or benefits” or any compensation agreement that “could lead to material financial loss.”
     The proposed rules would also require that the Company’s board of directors, or a committee thereof, conduct oversight of its incentive-based compensation program and approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers. Additionally, the Company and the Bank would be required to create and maintain records that document the structure of all the incentive-based compensation arrangements, demonstrate compliance with the final rules, and disclose those records to the appropriate Federal regulator upon request. In July 2017, the SEC released its rulemaking agenda and did not include the rules under Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, it is not certain when the final rules may be issued.
     Volcker Rule — In December 2013, the final Volcker Rule provision of the Dodd-Frank Act was approved and implemented by the FRB, the FDIC, the SEC, and the CFTC (collectively, the “Agencies”). The Volcker Rule aims to reduce risk and banking system instability by restricting U.S. banks from investing in or engaging in proprietary trading and speculation and imposing a strict framework to justify exemptions for underwriting, market making, and hedging activities. U.S. banks are restricted from investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities 

 
  16

 
that do not hedge a specific identified risk. Affected institutions were required to fully conform to the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015. As of the date of this filing, the Bank has been and is in compliance with the Volcker Rule.
     I.The Company
     Source of Strength Doctrine — Under FRB policy, a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources for their support. Such support may restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends, and may be required at times when, absent this FRB policy, a holding company may not be inclined to provide it. A BHC may also be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary and any applicable cross-guarantee provisions that may apply to the Company. In addition, any capital loans by the Company to its bank subsidiary are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiary. In the event of a BHC’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. The Dodd-Frank Act codifies the Federal Reserve Board’s existing “source of strength” policy that holding companies act as a source of strength to their insured institution subsidiaries by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of distress. FRB policies and regulations also prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The FDIC and the KDFI have similar restrictions with respect to the Bank.
     Acquisitions — The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB under the BHCA before it may, among other things, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such bank. In addition, the Bank must obtain regulatory approval before entering into certain transactions, such as adding new banking offices and mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the FRB is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the BHC, its subsidiaries and related banks, and the target bank involved, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and various competitive and other factors. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, which is discussed below. Consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties’ performance under the CRA (as defined below). Under the CRA, all financial institutions have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of their designated communities, specifically including low-to-moderate income persons and neighborhoods.
     Under the BHCA, so long as it is at least adequately capitalized, adequately managed, has a satisfactory or better CRA rating, and is not subject to any regulatory restrictions, the Company may purchase a bank, subject to regulatory approval. Similarly, an adequately capitalized and adequately managed BHC located outside of Kentucky, Florida, Indiana, Ohio or Tennessee may purchase a bank located inside Kentucky, Florida, Indiana, Ohio or Tennessee subject to appropriate regulatory approvals. In either case, however, state law restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has been in existence for a limited amount of time, or would result in specified concentrations of deposits. For example, Kentucky law prohibits a BHC from acquiring control of banks located in Kentucky if the holding company would then hold more than 15% of the total deposits of all federally insured depository institutions in Kentucky.
     The BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act also generally require the approval of the Federal Reserve before any person or company acquiring control of a state bank or BHC. Acquiring control conclusively occurs if immediately after a transaction, the acquiring person or company owns, controls, or holds voting securities of the institution with the power to vote 25% or more of any class. Acquiring control is refutably presumed if, immediately after a transaction, the acquiring person or company owns, controls, or holds voting securities of the institution with the power to vote 10% or more of any class, and (i) the institution has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (ii) no other person will own, control, or hold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction.
     Financial Activities — As an FHC, the Company is permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a BHC under the BHCA. Permitted activities for an FHC include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are declared by the FRB, in cooperation with the Treasury Department, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or are declared by the FRB unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. In addition, an FHC is allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible non-bank financial companies with after-the-fact notice to the FRB. A BHC may elect to become an FHC if each of its banking subsidiaries is well capitalized, is well managed and has at least a “Satisfactory” rating under the CRA. The Dodd-Frank Act also extended the well capitalized and well managed requirement to the BHC. To maintain FHC status, the Company must continue to meet certain 

 
  17

 
requirements. The failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of the Company and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions (including mergers and acquisitions) or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith, as well as loss of FHC status. If restrictions are imposed on the activities of an FHC, such information may not necessarily be available to the public.
     Subject to certain exceptions, state banks are permitted to control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary that engages in a broader range of activities than are permissible for national banks to engage in directly, subject to any restrictions imposed on a bank under the laws of the state under which it is organized. Conducting financial activities through a bank subsidiary can impact capital adequacy and regulatory restrictions may apply to affiliate transactions between the bank and its financial subsidiaries.
     Code of Conduct and Ethics — The Company has adopted a code of conduct and ethics that applies to all employees, including the Company’s principal executive, financial and accounting officers. The Company’s code of conduct and ethics is posted on the Bank’s website. The Company intends to disclose information about any amendments to, or waivers from, the code of conduct and ethics that are required to be disclosed under applicable SEC regulations by providing appropriate information on the Company’s website. If at any time the code of conduct and ethics is not available on the Company’s website, the Company will provide a copy of it free of charge upon written request.
     II.The Bank
     The Kentucky and federal banking statutes prescribe the permissible activities in which a Kentucky chartered bank may engage and where those activities may be conducted. Kentucky’s statutes contain a super parity provision that permits a well-rated Kentucky bank to engage in any banking activity in which a national bank in Kentucky, a state bank, state thrift, or state savings association operating in any other state, a federal savings bank or a federal thrift meeting the qualified thrift lender test engages, provided it first obtains a legal opinion from counsel specifying the statutory or regulatory provisions that permit the activity.
     Safety and Soundness – The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) asset quality; (vii) earnings; and (viii) compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth safety and soundness standards that the federal banking regulatory agencies use to identify and address problems at FDIC member institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the FDIC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the FDIC may require the Bank to submit to it an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. FDIC regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans in response to any such determination. We are not aware of any conditions relating to these safety and soundness standards that would require us to submit a plan of compliance to the FDIC.
     Branching — Kentucky law generally permits a Kentucky chartered bank to establish a branch office in any county in Kentucky. A Kentucky bank may also, subject to regulatory approval and certain restrictions, establish a branch office outside of Kentucky. Well-capitalized Kentucky chartered banks that have been in operation at least three years and that satisfy certain criteria relating to, among other things, their composite and management ratings, may establish a branch in Kentucky without the approval of the Commissioner of the KDFI, upon notice to the KDFI and any other state bank with its main office located in the county where the new branch will be located. Branching by all banks not meeting these criteria requires the approval of the Commissioner of the KDFI, who must ascertain and determine that the public convenience and advantage will be served and promoted and that there is a reasonable probability of the successful operation of the branch. In any case, the proposed branch must also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial condition, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. As a result of several legislative acts including the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank, along with any other national or state-chartered bank generally may branch across state lines. Such unlimited branching authority has the potential to increase competition within the markets in which the Company and the Bank operate.
     Affiliate Transaction Restrictions — Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, and in some cases the Bank’s correspondent banks, are subject to FDIC regulations, the FRB’s Regulations O and W, and Sections 23A, 23B, 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (“FRA”). In general, these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary, as those for comparable transactions with non-affiliated parties. In addition, certain types of these transactions referred to as “covered transactions” are subject to quantitative limits based on a percentage of the Bank’s capital, thereby restricting the total dollar amount of transactions the Bank may engage in 

 
  18

 
with each individual affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. Affiliates must pledge qualifying collateral in amounts between 100% and 130% of the covered transaction in order to receive loans from the Bank. Limitations are also imposed on loans and extensions of credit by a bank to its executive officers, directors and principal stockholders and each of their related interests.
     The FRB promulgated Regulation W to implement Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA. This regulation contains many of the foregoing restrictions and addresses derivative transactions, overdraft facilities, and other transactions between a bank and its non-bank affiliates.
     Restrictions on Distribution of Subsidiary Bank Dividends and Assets — Bank regulators may declare a dividend payment to be unsafe and unsound even if the Bank continues to meet its capital requirements after the dividend. Dividends paid by the Bank provide substantially all of the Company’s operating funds. Regulatory requirements limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under federal regulations, the Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the Bank would be undercapitalized.
     Under Kentucky and federal banking regulations, the dividends the Bank can pay during any calendar year are generally limited to its profits for that year, plus its retained net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock or debt, absent approval of the respective state or federal banking regulators. FDIC regulations also require all insured depository institutions to remain in a safe and sound condition, as defined in regulations, as a condition of having FDIC deposit insurance.
     FDIC Deposit Insurance Assessments — All Bank deposits are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the DIF. These bank deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF.
     In addition to assessments for deposit insurance premiums, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financial Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. These assessments will continue until the last Financial Corporation bonds mature in 2019.
     The FDIC’s risk-based premium system provides for quarterly assessments. Each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories depending on supervisory and capital considerations. Within its risk category, an institution is assigned to an initial base assessment rate, which is then adjusted. The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly from one quarter to the next, however, no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of paying FDIC deposit insurance assessments.
     Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC revised the deposit insurance premium assessment method for banks with less than $10 billion in assets that have been insured by the FDIC for at least five years. This revision changed the assessment method to the financial ratios method, which is based on a statistical model estimating the probability of failure of a bank over three years. The FDIC also updated the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model, eliminated risk categories for established small banks, and used the financial ratios method to determine assessment rates for all such banks (subject to minimum or maximum initial assessment rates based upon a bank’s composite examination rating). The initial base assessment rates for all insured institutions were reduced from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points. Total base assessment rates after possible adjustments were reduced from 2.5 to 45 basis points to 1.5 to 40 basis points. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
     The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances that would result in termination of the Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance.

 Anti-Money Laundering, Patriot ACT; OFAC Sanctions – AML measures and economic sanctions have long been a matter of regulatory focus in the U.S. The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonly referred to as the "Bank Secrecy Act" or "BSA," requires U.S. financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering by imposing various reporting and recordkeeping requirements on financial institutions. Passage of the Patriot Act renewed and expanded this focus, extending greatly the breadth and depth of AML measures required under the BSA. The Patriot Act requires all financial institutions to establish certain anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs, including enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls for certain types of relationships deemed to pose heightened risks. In cooperation with federal banking regulatory agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is responsible for implementing, administering, and enforcing BSA compliance.
     Failure to comply with these laws or maintain an adequate compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage. Federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger, acquisition, restructuring, or other expansionary activity. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions by regulators, as well as state attorneys general and the Department of Justice, against banks, broker-dealers and non-bank financial institutions with respect to these laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including criminal pleas.
     Consumer Laws and Regulations — The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB in order to regulate any person who offers or provides personal, family or household financial products or services. The CFPB is an independent “watchdog” within the Federal Reserve System to enforce and create “Federal consumer financial laws.” Banks as well as nonbanks are subject to any rule, regulation or guideline created by the CFPB. Congress established the CFPB to create one agency in charge of protecting consumers by overseeing the application and implementation of “Federal consumer financial laws,” which includes (i) rules, orders and guidelines of the CFPB, (ii) all consumer financial protection functions, powers and duties transferred from other federal agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and (iii) a long list of consumer financial protection laws enumerated in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws, including, but not limited to, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Military Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, among many others. Moreover, as discussed in more detail below, we further comply with fair lending and privacy laws. 
     The CFPB is authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The authority to prohibit “abusive” acts or practices was newly added to federal law with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB has engaged in rulemaking and taken enforcement actions that directly impact the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the Bank and its divisions, and is expected to adopt a regulation related to the definition of “abusive” acts or practices in the near future. Depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer protection laws and regulations by their primary bank regulators (the FDIC for the Bank), rather than the CFPB. The FDIC also regulates what it considers unfair and deceptive practices under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
     Such laws and regulations and the other consumer protection laws and regulations to which the Bank has been subject have historically mandated certain disclosure requirements and regulated the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits from, making loans to, or engaging in other types of transactions with, such customers. The continued effect of the CFPB on the development and promulgation of consumer protection rules and guidelines and the enforcement of federal “consumer financial laws” on the Bank, if any, cannot be determined with certainty at this time.
     Community Reinvestment Act and the Fair Lending Laws – Banks have a responsibility under the CRA and related regulations of the FDIC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of applications. In addition, an institution’s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in the FDIC, other federal regulatory agencies or the Department of Justice, taking enforcement actions against the institution. Failure by the Bank to fully comply with these laws could result in 

 
  20

 
material penalties being assessed against the Bank. In May 2018, the Bank received a “Satisfactory” CRA Performance Evaluation. A copy of the public section of this CRA Performance Evaluation is available to the public upon request.
     Privacy and Data Security – The FRB, FDIC, and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines (the “Guidelines) for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. The Guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. If the Bank fails to properly safeguard customer information or is the subject of a successful cyber-attack, it could result in material fines and/or liabilities that would materially affect the Company’s results of operations.
     In addition, various U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the SEC, have increased their focus on cyber-security through guidance, examinations and regulations. The Company has adopted a customer information security program that has been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.
     The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banking subsidiary’s policies and procedures. In addition to the GLBA, the Company and the Bank are also subject to state and international privacy laws.
     Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements — The Bank is subject to prohibitions on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the client obtain some additional product or service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
     Depositor Preference — The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the U.S. and the parent BHC, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
     Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions — FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of another FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to another FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same BHC that is in danger of default. “Default” generally means the appointment of a conservator or receiver. “In danger of default” generally means the existence of certain conditions indicating that default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. Such a “cross-guarantee” claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against that depository institution. At this time, the Bank is the only insured depository institution controlled by the Company. However, if the Company were to control other FDIC-insured depository institutions in the future, the cross-guarantee would apply to all such FDIC-insured depository institutions.
     Federal Home Loan Bank System — The FHLB offers credit to its members, which include savings banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, credit unions, and other entities. The FHLB system is currently divided into eleven federally chartered regional FHLBs that are regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Bank is a member and owns capital stock in the FHLB Cincinnati. The amount of capital stock the Bank must own to maintain its membership depends on its balance of outstanding advances. It is required to acquire and hold shares in an amount at least equal to 1% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid single-family residential real estate loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, or 1/20th of its outstanding advances from the FHLB, whichever is greater. Advances are secured by pledges of loans, mortgage backed securities and capital stock of the FHLB. FHLBs also purchase mortgages in the secondary market through their MPP. The Bank has never sold loans to the MPP.

 In the event of a default on an advance, the Federal Home Loan Bank Act establishes priority of the FHLB’s claim over various other claims. Regulations provide that each FHLB has joint and several liability for the obligations of the other FHLBs in the system. If an FHLB falls below its minimum capital requirements, the FHLB may seek to require its members to purchase additional capital stock of the FHLB. If problems within the FHLB system were to occur, it could adversely affect the pricing or availability of advances, the amount and timing of dividends on capital stock issued by FHLBs to its members, or the ability of members to have their FHLB capital stock redeemed on a timely basis. Congress continues to consider various proposals that could establish a new regulatory structure for the FHLB system, as well as for other government-sponsored entities. The Bank cannot predict at this time, which, if any, of these proposals may be adopted or what effect they would have on the Bank’s business.
     Federal Reserve System — Under regulations of the FRB, the Bank is required to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against its transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Bank is in compliance with the foregoing reserve requirements. Required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash, a depository account at the FRB, or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. The effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank’s interest-earning assets. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the FRB may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the FDIC. The Bank is authorized to borrow from the FRB discount window.
     Loans to One Borrower — Under current limits, loans and extensions of credit outstanding at one time to a single borrower and not fully secured generally may not exceed 15% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral may represent an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
     Loans to Insiders — The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRA and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders: (a) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with non-insiders and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other features that are unfavorable to the Bank; and (b) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital.
     The regulations allow small discounts on fees on residential mortgages for directors, officers and employees. In addition, extensions of credit to insiders in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors.
     Capital Adequacy Requirements
     Capital Guidelines — The Company and the Bank are subject to capital regulations in accordance with Basel III, as administered by banking regulators. Regulatory guidelines are established by the FRB in the case of the Company and the FDIC in the case of the Bank. The FRB and FDIC have substantially similar risk-based and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations, which are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital related to the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet instruments. Under the risk-based guidelines, specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk-weighted asset base. In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the FRB used a leverage ratio as a tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. The leverage ratio is a company’s Tier 1 Capital divided by its average total consolidated assets (less goodwill and certain other intangible assets).
     The federal banking agencies’ risk-based and leverage ratios represent minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, assuming that they have the highest regulatory capital rating. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are required to operate with capital positions above the minimum ratios. FRB guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions may be expected to maintain strong capital positions above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. The FDIC may establish higher minimum capital adequacy requirements if, for example, a bank proposes to make an acquisition requiring regulatory approval, has previously warranted special regulatory attention, rapid growth presents supervisory concerns, or, among other factors, has a high susceptibility to interest rate and other types of risk. The Bank is not subject to any such individual minimum regulatory capital requirement.

 Banking regulators have categorized the Bank as well-capitalized. For purposes of prompt corrective action, “well capitalized” banks must have a minimum 6.5% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 8.0% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, 10.0% Total Risk-Based Capital ratio and 5.0% Tier 1 Leverage ratio. Additionally, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, the Company and Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital above their minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer phased in from 2016 through 2019 on the following schedule: a capital conservation buffer of 0.625% effective January 1, 2016; 1.25% effective January 1, 2017; 1.875% effective January 1, 2018; and a fully phased in capital conservation buffer of 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
     As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s capital ratios were as follows:

      Corrective Measures for Capital Deficiencies — The banking regulators are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to capital deficient institutions. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A bank is undercapitalized if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized.
     Undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are required to submit a capital restoration plan, which must be guaranteed by the holding company of the institution. In addition, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment, and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment. A bank’s capital classification will also affect its ability to accept brokered deposits. Under banking regulations, a bank may not lawfully accept, roll over or renew brokered deposits, unless it is either well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from its applicable regulator.
     If a banking institution’s capital decreases below acceptable levels, bank regulatory enforcement powers become more enhanced. A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management and other restrictions. Banking regulators have limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and are normally required to appoint a receiver or conservator. Banks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may also be subject to certain administrative actions, including the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing if the institution has no tangible capital.
     In addition, a BHC may face significant consequences if its bank subsidiary fails to maintain the required capital and management ratings, including entering into an agreement with the FRB that imposes limitations on its operations and may even require 

 
  23

 
divestitures. Such possible ramifications may limit the ability of a bank subsidiary to significantly expand or acquire less than well-capitalized and well-managed institutions. More specifically, the FRB’s regulations require an FHC, such as the Company, to notify the FRB within 15 days of becoming aware that any depository institution controlled by the company has ceased to be well-capitalized or well-managed. If the FRB determines that an FHC controls a depository institution that is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB will notify the FHC that it is not in compliance with applicable requirements and may require the FHC to enter into an agreement acceptable to the FRB to correct any deficiencies, or require the FHC to decertify as an FHC. Until such deficiencies are corrected, the FRB may impose any limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the FHC and its affiliates that the FRB determines are appropriate, and the FHC may not commence any additional activity or acquire control of any company under Section 4(k) of the BHCA without prior FRB approval. Unless the period for compliance is extended by the FRB, if an FHC fails to correct deficiencies in maintaining its qualification for FHC status within 180 days of notice to the FRB, the FRB may order divestiture of any depository institution controlled by the company. A company may comply with a divestiture order by ceasing to engage in any financial or other activity that would not be permissible for a BHC that has not elected to be treated as an FHC. The Company is currently classified as an FHC.
     Under FDICIA, each federal banking agency has prescribed, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. These standards cover internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions.
     Other Regulation and Legislative Initiatives
     Any change in the regulations affecting the Bank’s operations is not predictable and could affect the Bank’s operations and profitability. The U.S. Congress and state legislative bodies also continually consider proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and competitive relationships of financial institutions. It cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any of these potential proposals or regulatory initiatives will be adopted, the impact the proposals will have on the financial institutions industry or the extent to which the business or financial condition and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries may be affected.
