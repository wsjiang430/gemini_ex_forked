Item 1. | Business (all dollar amounts in thousands except share, per share and revenue per equivalent admission amounts)
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview
 SunLink Health Systems, Inc., through subsidiaries, owns businesses which provide healthcare products and services in certain markets in the southeastern United States. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “SunLink,” “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us” and the “Company” refer to SunLink Health Systems, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. References to our specific operations refer to operations conducted through our subsidiaries and references to “we,” “our,” “ours,” and “us” in such context refer to the operations of our subsidiaries. Our business is composed of two business segments, the Healthcare Services segment and the Pharmacy segment. Our Healthcare Services segment subsidiaries own and operate an 84- bed community hospital and a 66- bed nursing home in Mississippi, an IT service company based in Georgia, and a healthcare facility which is partially leased to a third parties. Our Pharmacy segment subsidiary owns and operates a pharmacy business in Louisiana with four service lines.
 SunLink’s executive offices are located at 900 Circle 75 Parkway, Suite 1120, Atlanta, Georgia 30339, and our telephone number is (770) 933-7000. Our website address is www.sunlinkhealth.com. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this report. Certain materials we file with the SEC may also be read and copied at or through our website or at the Internet website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.
 Business Strategy
 The business strategy of SunLink is to focus its efforts on improving the operations, services and profitability of its existing Healthcare Services and Pharmacy businesses while seeking to sell certain of its subsidiaries’ underperforming assets.
 The Company has used a portion of the cash proceeds from recent dispositions of assets to pay down debt and certain other liabilities, to repurchase common shares, including tender offers completed in February and December 2017, a private purchase and open market repurchases of its common shares in December 2018, and to make improvements to its Healthcare Services and Pharmacy businesses. The Company may also use existing cash, as well as any net proceeds from future dispositions, if any, to, among other things, prepay debts, return capital to shareholders, including through potential public or private purchases of shares, improve its existing businesses, make selective acquisitions of Healthcare Services, Pharmacy or other businesses, and for other general corporate purposes. There is no assurance that any further dispositions will be authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors or, if authorized, that any such transactions will be completed or, if completed, will result in net cash proceeds to the Company on a before or after tax basis. The Company considers the disposition of business segments, facilities and operations based on a variety of factors in addition to under-performance, including asset values, return on investments, competition from existing and potential competitors, capital improvement needs, the prevailing reimbursement environment under various Federal and state programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid) and private payors, and other corporate objectives. The Company believes certain facilities in its Healthcare Services segment as well as its Pharmacy segment continue to under-perform.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Trace receives payments for patient care from Federal Medicare programs, State Medicaid programs, private insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, TriCare, and from employers and patients directly. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, that provides hospital and nursing home benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care. Trace is certified as a healthcare services provider for persons covered by Medicare and Medicaid programs. TriCare is a federal program for the healthcare of certain U.S. military personnel and their dependents. See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.
 Patients generally are not responsible for any difference between established charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid and some private insurer plans, health maintenance organization (“HMO”) plans and preferred provider organizations (“PPO”) plans, but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has been increasing in recent years. Collection of amounts due from individuals typically is more difficult than from governmental or other third-party payors. Further, amounts received under the Medicare and Medicaid programs generally are significantly less than the established charges of our facilities. for the services provided. Likewise, HMOs and PPOs generally seek and obtain discounts from the established charges. See “Item 1. Business—Government Reimbursement Programs—Hospitals—Medicare/Medicaid Reimbursement”.
 Changes in the mix of the patient and resident population among reimbursement categories can significantly affect the profitability of our Healthcare Services operations. We cannot assure you that reimbursement payments under governmental and private third-party payor programs, including private Medicare supplemental insurance coverage, will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs. Medicare reimbursement for services performed in nursing homes is subject to fixed payments under the Medicare prospective payment systems. In accordance with Medicare laws, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (‘CMS”) makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems under what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“Med PAC”), a commission chartered by Congress to advise it on Medicare payment issues, makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems. Congress is not obligated to adopt Med PAC’s recommendations, and, based upon outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance that Congress will adopt Med Pac’s recommendations in a given year. Medicaid reimbursement rates in the state in which we operate a nursing home also are based upon fixed payment systems. Generally, these rates are adjusted annually for inflation. However, these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement can be impacted negatively by state budgetary pressures, which may lead to reduced reimbursement or delays in receiving payments. Moreover, we cannot assure you that the hospital or nursing home operated by us, or the provision of goods and services offered by us, will meet the requirements for participation in such programs.
 Utilization of Local Management Teams
 Each of our businesses is managed by a subsidiary officer who is supported by other professional personnel as needed, including, but not limited to, a state-licensed nursing home administrator, a director of nursing, nursing assistants, licensed practical nurses, staff development coordinators, activities directors, social services directors, clinical liaisons, admissions coordinators, licensed pharmacists, licensed pharmacy technicians, IT staff, and business office managers. Staff size and composition vary depending on the size and occupancy or volume of activity of each businesses, the types of services provided and the acuity level of the patients and residents. The nursing home contracts with physicians who provide medical director services and serve on performance improvement committees. Our businesses purchase certain services including information systems from an affiliate and obtain certain services such as legal, finance, accounting, purchasing, human resources and facilities management support, from vendors recommended by SunLink. 
Quality Assurance
 6

Quality of care and services is monitored and enhanced by our clinical operations personnel, as well as family satisfaction surveys. The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the “IMPACT Act”), passed on October 6, 2014, requires standardized assessment data for quality improvement, payment, and discharge planning purposes across the spectrum of post acute-care providers (“PACs”), including skilled nursing facilities.
 Trace implements quality assurance procedures to monitor the level and quality of care provided to patients and has a medical director who supervises and is responsible for the quality of medical care so provided, as well as a medical advisory committee comprised of physicians who review the professional credentials of physicians applying for medical staff privileges at the facility. The medical advisory committee also reviews the quality of the logistical, medical and technological support provided to the physicians. Trace periodically conducts surveys of their patients, either during their stay or subsequently, to identify potential areas of improvement. Trace is accredited by The Joint Commission (“JCAHO”).
 Our pharmacy business maintains quality assurance procedures under the direction of licensed pharmacists-in-charge (“PIC”) including, among other procedures, regular inventories and reconciliations of drugs by a PIC who is supported by pharmacy technicians. 
 Competition
 Among the factors which we believe influence patient and customer selection in our healthcare businesses are the appearance and functionality of the facilities; the quality and demeanor of professional staff, physicians and pharmacists; and the participation of our businesses in plans which pay all or a portion of the patient’s bill. Such factors are influenced heavily by the quality and scope of services, strength of referral networks, location and the price of services.
 Trace competes with similar senior care facilities primarily on the basis of quality of care, reputation, location, and physical appearance and, in the case of private payment residents, the charges for our services. Our Healthcare Services facilities also compete on a local and regional basis with other facilities providing similar services, including hospitals, extended care centers, assisted living facilities, home health agencies, and similar institutions. Some competitors may operate newer facilities and may provide services, including skilled nursing services that we may not offer at our nursing home. Our competitors include government-owned, religious organization-owned, secular nonprofit and for-profit institutions. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Although there is limited, if any, price competition with respect to Medicare and Medicaid residents (since revenues received for services provided to these residents are generally based on pre-established rates), there is substantial price competition for private payment residents. Our Floy Dyer Nursing Home is located adjacent to our Trace Regional Hospital. 
 Our Carmichael’s Pharmacy competes with retail and institutional pharmacies, home health providers, and DME providers, including national chains with vastly more resources and larger distribution systems than our, as well as with local pharmacies with strong reputations with the community.  We compete primarily on the basis of location, service, participation in pharmacy reimbursement and benefit plans, and reputation. Our retail pharmacy business seeks to provide non-pharmacy items such as snacks, gifts and merchandise to customers who visit our pharmacy, and our local staff are generally long-time community residents known to many of our pharmacy customers.  We believe our personal service approach provides us the ability to compete with larger pharmacy chains which operate larger stores and provide more merchandise offerings. 
 SHS Technology competes with companies which provide IT hosting, computer hardware, IT software, and IT consulting services to customers, either for fees or in connection with the sale of hardware or software. SHS Technology does not sell hardware or software. SHS Technology’s competitors may have larger staffs and greater resources and be subsidized by hardware or software vendors or related businesses. Price competition for IT services such as SHS Technology provides is intense and some potential customers operate on legacy IT systems which make it difficult to change to systems which SHS Technology is able to support.
 Managed Care
 Our subsidiaries are affected by their ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services. HMOs, PPOs and pharmacy benefit managers attempt to direct and control the use of healthcare products, drugs and services through managed care programs. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers increasingly are seeking to contain costs through negotiations with facilities for managed care programs and discounts from established charges. Generally, facilities compete for service contracts with healthcare service purchasers on the basis of market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of medical staff, convenience and price.
 The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market, depending on the market strength of such organizations. Nevertheless, a significant portion of patients in our hospital and pharmacy communities are covered by managed care or other reimbursement programs, all of which generally pay less than established charges for products and services.
 7

The healthcare industry as a whole faces the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while managing rising costs, facing strong competition for patients, and adjusting to a continued general reduction of reimbursement rates by both private and government payors. Both private and government payors continually seek to reduce the nature and scope of services which may be reimbursed and healthcare reforms at both the federal and state level generally have created pressure to reduce reimbursement rates. Changes in medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations, and competitive contracting for drugs and provider services by private and government payors, have required and in the future may further require changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, rates and/or services.
 Efforts to Control Healthcare Costs
 Rural facilities, including Trace, continue to have significant unused capacity. Average occupancy rates continue to be affected negatively by payor-required pre-admission authorization, utilization review, and payment mechanisms designed to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients and to limit the cost of nursing home care. Admissions constraints, payor pressures, and increased competition are likely to continue. Historically, facilities owned and operated by SunLink’s subsidiaries have responded to such trends by upgrading facilities and equipment and adding or expanding certain inpatient and ancillary services. In addition, our facilities have reduced services and taken beds out of service in response to such trends. Currently we expect our facilities will continue to respond to such trends in a similar manner, subject to the availability of capital resources and our evaluation of the continued utility of such historical responses.
Health Care Reform
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA”) were signed into law by former President Obama on March 23, 2010, and March 30, 2010, respectively. The ACA alters the United States health care system and is intended to decrease the number of uninsured Americans and reduce overall health care costs. The ACA attempts to achieve these goals by expanding Medicare and Medicaid eligibility, reducing Medicare and Medicaid payments including disproportionate share payments, expanding the Medicare program’s use of value-based purchasing programs, tying hospital payments to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria, and bundling payments to hospitals and other providers. The ACA also contains a number of measures that are intended to reduce fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as requiring the use of recovery audit contractors in the Medicaid program and generally prohibiting physician-owned hospitals from adding new physician owners or increasing the number of beds and operating rooms for which they are licensed. We believe the implementation or interpretation of rules and regulations or the provisions of the ACA may have and may continue to have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations, especially since the one state in which we operate our hospital has decided not to set up state exchanges and not to expand Medicaid. During the current administration, various bills have been proposed or introduced into Congress to repeal and/or replace the ACA, and various executive orders and interpretations have been issued which modify the ACA. To date, no such bills have been passed by Congress and signed into law and there can be no assurance that any such bills will become law or, if so, the terms thereof.
GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAMS
 Government Reimbursement Programs—Hospitals
 A significant portion of SunLink’s Healthcare Services net revenues are dependent upon reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. CMS is the federal agency which administers Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”). The federal government generally reviews payment rates under its various programs annually, and changes in reimbursement rates under such programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, generally occur based on the fiscal year of the federal government which currently begins on October 1 and ends on September 30 of each year.
Medicare Inpatient Reimbursement
 The Medicare program currently pays hospitals under the provisions of a prospective payment system for most inpatient services. Under the inpatient prospective payment system, a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment, known as diagnosis related groups (“DRGs”). Each patient admitted for care is assigned to a DRG based upon a primary admitting diagnosis. Every DRG is assigned a payment rate by the government based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis. DRG payments do not consider a specific hospital’s costs, but are national rates adjusted for area wage differentials and case-mix indices.
 8

DRG rates are usually adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year (“FFY”). The percentage increases to DRG payment rates for the last several years have been lower than the percentage increases in the related cost of goods and services provided by general hospitals. The index used to adjust the DRG payment rates is based on a price statistic, known as the CMS Market Basket Index, reduced by congressionally mandated reduction factors and other factors imposed by CMS.
 DRG rate increases were 1.3%, 1.85% and 3.1% for FFY 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, which includes the following market basket update: FFY 2018 1.35%, FFY 2019 1.35% and FFY 2020 2.7%. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 originally set the increase in DRG payment rates for future FFYs at rates that would be based on the market basket index, which in certain years have been, and in the future may be, subject to reduction factors. If the update factor does not adequately reflect increases in the cost of providing inpatient services by our subsidiary’s hospital, our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.
 The ACA combined with the America Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (“ATRA”) and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MARA”) made a number of changes to the provisions of Medicare which include but are not limited to:
  
• | Reduction of market basket updates in Medicare payment rates for providers, to incorporate an adjustment for expected productivity gains. The market basket was reduced by 0.20% in FFYs 2015 and 2016, and by 0.75% in FFYs 2017-2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduction of Medicare payments that would otherwise be made to hospitals by specified percentages to account for preventable hospital readmissions, as defined by CMS, effective October 1, 2012.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extension of the Medicare Dependent Hospital Program until September 30, 2022.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion, on a temporary basis, of the low volume hospital inpatient payment adjustment to include hospitals that are more than 15 miles from other Healthcare Services and have less than 1,600 discharges per year. The new temporary criteria were effective for FFYs 2011 through 2013 and further expanded through September 30, 2022.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hospitals that do not successfully participate in the Hospital IQR Program and do not submit the required quality data will be subject to a one-fourth reduction of the market basket update.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A requirement that any hospital which is not a meaningful electronic health records user will be reduced by 50% of the market basket update in FFY 2018, by 61% of the market basket rate in FFY 2019 and 90% in FFY 2020. Our subsidiary hospital did not attest as a meaningful electronic records user for FFYs 2019, 2018 or 2017.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 SunLink’s subsidiary hospital is an eligible hospital under one or more provisions of ACA, ATRA and MARA.
 Medicare Outpatient Reimbursement
 Most outpatient services provided by general hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare under the outpatient prospective payment system. This outpatient prospective payment system is based on a system of Ambulatory Payment Classifications (“APC”). Each APC is designed to represent a “bundle” of outpatient services, and each APC is assigned a fully prospective reimbursement rate. Medicare pays a set price or rate for each APC group, regardless of the actual cost incurred in providing care. Each APC group rate generally is subject to adjustment each year by an “update factor” based on a market basket of services index. For calendar year 2017, the update factor was 1.65%. For calendar year 2018, the update factor was 2.0% and for calendar year 2019, the update factor was 2.0%. For calendar year 2020, the update factor is currently proposed to be 2.7%. If the update factor for current and future periods does not adequately reflect increases in SunLink’s subsidiary hospital cost of providing outpatient services, our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.
Medicare Bad Debt Reimbursement
 Under Medicare, the costs attributable to the deductible and coinsurance amounts that remain unpaid by Medicare beneficiaries can be partially added to, and reimbursed as a portion of, the Medicare share of allowable costs as cost reports are filed. Bad debts must meet specific criteria to be allowable. Hospitals generally receive interim pass-through payments during the cost report year which are determined by the respective Medicare Audit Contractor (“MAC”) from the prior cost report filing, and which are finally adjusted when cost reports are filed and audited.
 Amounts uncollectible from specific beneficiaries are charged off as bad debts in the accounting period in which the accounts are deemed to be worthless. In some cases, an amount previously written off as a bad debt and allocated to the program may be recovered in a subsequent accounting period. In these cases, the recoveries must be used to reduce the cost of beneficiary services for the period in which the collection is made. In determining reasonable costs for hospitals, the amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowable costs was reduced by 35% beginning FFY 2014.
 9

Medicare Disproportionate Share Payments
 In addition to the standard DRG payment, the Social Security Act requires that additional Medicare payments be made to hospitals with a disproportionate share of low income patients. Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act (“BIPA”) provisions stipulate that rural facilities with fewer than 100 beds with a disproportionate share percentage greater than 15% will be classified as a disproportionate share hospital and entitled to receive a supplemental disproportionate share payment based on gross DRG payments. Since April 1, 2004, the effective rate has been 12.0% of DRG payments. Trace is classified as a disproportionate share hospital as of July 1, 2016. The Affordable Care Act provides for material reductions in Medicare DSH funding. We estimate that Medicare disproportionate share payments represented less than 1% of our healthcare services net patient service revenues for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
Medicaid Inpatient and Outpatient Reimbursement
 Each state operates a Medicaid program funded jointly by the state and the federal government. Federal law governs the general management of the Medicaid program, but there is wide latitude for states to customize Medicaid programs to fit local needs and resources. As a result, each state Medicaid plan has its own payment formula and recipient eligibility criteria.
 In the recent past, the state in which our subsidiary operates its hospital has initiated increased efforts to reduce Medicaid assistance payments. These efforts and reductions often are triggered by an increased effort by CMS to decrease the federal share of payments for Medicaid beneficiaries or by significant increases in program utilization and budgetary pressures on the applicable states. The federal government’s percentage share of each state’s medical assistance expenditures under Medicaid is determined by a formula specified in Medicaid law referred to as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”).
 The state in which SunLink currently operates its Healthcare Services hospital and nursing home has implemented initiatives to decrease the Medicaid funds paid to providers. Medicaid pays providers for inpatient services in a manner similar to the Medicare prospective payment system in that hospitals receive a fixed fee for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment, also known as DRGs. These Medicaid DRG payments do not consider a specific hospital’s costs, but are statewide rates adjusted for each hospital's capital cost allotment.
 Medicaid outpatient services are reimbursed with interim rates based on a facility specific cost to charge ratio. These interim payments are then adjusted subsequent to the end of the cost reporting period to an amount equal to 85.6% of the costs associated with providing care to the Medicaid outpatient population.
 If SunLink or our subsidiaries or any of their facilities are found to be in violation of federal or state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs, SunLink or the applicable subsidiary or facility, could be subject to substantial monetary fines, civil penalties and exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
 Government Reimbursement Program Administration and Adjustments
 The Medicare, Medicaid and TriCare programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations and determinations, requirements for utilization review and changing governmental funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments under such programs.
 All hospitals participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.
 Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due. Providers have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits. Although the final outcome of these audits and the nature and amounts of any adjustments are difficult to predict, we believe that we have made adequate provisions in our financial statements for adjustments that may result from these audits and that final resolution of any contested issues should not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. Until final adjustment, however, significant issues may remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or greater than ultimately required.
 10

In 2005, CMS began using recovery audit contractors (“RACs”) to detect Medicare overpayments not identified through existing claims review mechanisms. The RAC program relies on private companies to examine Medicare claims filed by healthcare providers. The RAC program was made permanent by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. The ACA expanded the RAC program’s scope to include managed Medicare and Medicaid claims, and allows all states to establish programs to contract with RACs by 2011. Currently the state where our subsidiary operates has RAC programs, and our Healthcare Services hospital and nursing home have had requests from the RACs to review claims.
 RACs perform post-discharge audits of medical records to identify Medicare overpayments resulting from incorrect payment amounts, non-covered services, incorrectly coded services, and duplicate services. CMS has given RACs the authority to look back at claims up to three years old, provided that the claim was paid on or after October 1, 2007. Claims review strategies used by RACs generally include a review of high dollar claims, including inpatient hospital claims. As a result, a large amount of the total recovered by RACs has come from hospitals. Claims identified as overpayments are subject to an appeals process and the Company’s Healthcare Services facilities have routinely appealed RAC overpayment determinations. Under the RAC program, our Healthcare Services facilities have experienced losses in the aggregate from audit adjustments of approximately $11 and $48 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018.
 RACs are paid a contingency fee based on the overpayments they identify and collect. We expect that the RACs will continue to look closely at claims submitted by our Healthcare Service facilities in an attempt to identify possible overpayments. Although we believe the claims for reimbursement submitted to the Medicare program are accurate, we cannot predict the results of any future RAC audits.
 In addition, CMS employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. The ACA has increased federal funding for the MIC program since FFY 2011. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have also increased their review activities.
 Government Reimbursement Programs—Nursing Homes
 Medicare —The Medicare Part A program provides reimbursement for extended-care services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries who are admitted to nursing homes after at least a three-day stay in an acute care hospital. Covered services include supervised nursing care room and board, social services, physical, speech, and occupational therapies, certain pharmaceuticals and supplies and other necessary services provided by nursing homes. Medicare payments to our nursing home are based upon certain resource utilization grouping (“RUG”) payment rates developed by CMS that provide various levels of reimbursement based upon patient acuity.
 Medicare Part B provides reimbursement for certain physician services, limited drug coverage, and other outpatient services, such as therapy and other services, outside of a Medicare Part A covered patient stay. Payment for these services is determined according to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”). The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) established Medicare physician reimbursement updates with quality and value measurements and participation in alternative payment models.
 In 2006, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) implemented a major expansion of the Medicare program through the introduction of a prescription drug benefit (“Medicare Part D”). Under Medicare Part D, dual-eligible patients have their outpatient prescription drug costs covered by this Medicare benefit, subject to certain limitations. Most of our nursing home patients are dual-eligible patients who qualify for the Medicare drug benefit. Accordingly, Medicaid is no longer a primary payor for the pharmacy services provided to these patients.
 On April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) was enacted, which directed CMS to create a value-based purchasing initiative applicable to nursing homes beginning October 1, 2018. The initiative focused on a preventable hospital readmission measure to be provided on or before October 1, 2015 and corresponding preventable hospital readmission rates to be provided on or before October 1, 2016. Nursing homes are ranked according to performance on this preventable hospital readmission rate, with corresponding incentive payments based upon such ranking. CMS also reduced the Medicare per diem rate by 2% beginning October 1, 2018 in connection with the launch of this initiative.
 
Effective October 1, 2019, CMS will replace the prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities, RUG, with a new prospective payment system called Patient-Driven Payment Model (“PDPM”).  PDPM bases payment on resident characteristics rather than on services provided.  Each resident’s reimbursement depends on the summations of five case–mix adjusted components (physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology, nursing, and nontherapy ancillaries), each with its own case-mix groups; application of a variable per day adjustment schedule, which reduces the daily payment for three of the case-mix categories on a sliding scale; and addition of these sums to the non-case-mix adjusted component. PDPM uses the five-day resident assessment for determining the Medicare rate for the resident’s entire Part A stay, eliminating the RUG requirement for additional assessments on 
 11

days 14, 30, 60 and 90.  The rule allows a skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) to reclassify a resident after the five-day assessment under an optional Interim Payment Assessment (“IPA”) but CMS has not yet defined criteria for triggering an IPA. 
 Federal legislation has imposed various limitations and administrative requirements on Medicare reimbursement, including therapy caps, automatic and specific payment reductions, pre-payment manual claim reviews and other efforts to limit reimbursement. CMS also provides periodic reimbursements updates, including market basket updates, which are often reduced by various factors.
 Medicaid —Medicaid is a state-administered program financed by state funds and matching federal funds. The program provides for medical assistance to the indigent and certain other eligible persons. Although administered under broad federal regulations, states are given flexibility to construct programs and payment methods consistent with their individual goals. Accordingly, these programs differ in many respects from state to state.
 Our nursing home provides Medicaid-covered services consisting of nursing care, room and board, and social services to eligible individuals. In addition, states may, at their option, cover other services such as physical, occupational, and speech therapies, and pharmaceuticals. Medicaid programs also are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy by the state agencies, and certain government funding limitations, all of which may materially increase or decrease the level of program payments to our nursing home. We believe that the payments under many of these programs may not be sufficient on an overall basis to cover the costs of serving certain patients participating in these programs. In addition, Mississippi is experiencing budgetary pressures which have resulted in further reductions to Medicaid payments to our nursing homes.
 There continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose further limitations on government and private payments to providers of healthcare services. Many states are considering or have enacted measures that are designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make certain changes to private healthcare insurance. As states face budgetary issues, we anticipate further pressure on Medicaid rates that could negatively impact payments to our nursing home.
 In addition, some states (including Mississippi) seek to increase the levels of funding contributed by the federal government to their Medicaid programs through a mechanism known as a provider tax. Under these programs, states levy a tax on healthcare providers, which increases the amount of state revenue available to expend on the Medicaid program. This increase in program revenues increases the payment made by the federal government to the state in the form of matching funds. Consequently, the state then has more funds available to support Medicaid rates for providers of Medicaid covered services. However, states may not necessarily use these funds to increase payments to nursing home providers. Provider tax plans are subject to approval by the federal government. Although some of these plans have been approved in the past, we cannot assure you that such plans will be approved by the federal government in the future.
 Nongovernment payments —Although our nursing home seeks to maximize the number of nongovernment payment residents it admits, including those covered under private insurance and managed care health plans, nongovernment payment residents in our nursing home are limited. Nongovernment payment residents typically have financial resources (including insurance coverage) to pay for their services and do not rely on government programs for support. It is important to our business to establish relationships with commercial insurers, managed care health plans, and other private payors and to maintain our reputation with such payors as a provider of quality patient and resident care. We negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services, including private employers, commercial insurers, and managed care companies. Most payor organizations attempt to obtain discounts from established charges. We focus on demonstrating to these payors how our services can provide them and their customers with the most viable pricing arrangements in circumstances where they may otherwise be faced with funding treatment at higher rates at other healthcare providers. The importance of obtaining contracts with commercial insurers, managed care health plans and other private payors varies among markets, depending on such factors as the number of commercial payors and their relative market strength. Failure to obtain contracts with certain commercial insurers and managed care health plans or reductions in lengths of stay or payments for our services provided to individuals covered by commercial insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.
 Government Reimbursement Programs — Pharmacy
 The operations of our Pharmacy segment are subject to certain rules implemented by MMA and, in the future, may be subject to other rules previously implemented by MMA with respect to urban providers. Regulations implementing cost containment mandates under MMA reduced the reimbursement for healthcare providers in urban areas for a number of products and services which are also provided by our pharmacy operations and established a competitive bidding program for certain durable medical equipment provided under Medicare Part B in urban areas. Competitive bidding is intended to further reduce reimbursement for certain products and will likely decrease the number of companies permitted to serve Medicare beneficiaries in the competitive bidding areas (“CBAs”). CMS had planned to implement the competitive bidding program for Medicare durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (“DMEPOS”) products and services with the goal of offering beneficiaries access to quality with lower out-of-pocket costs. Prior to January 1, 2016, our Pharmacy segment operations were exempted under the Deficit Reduction Act of 
 12

2005 from the proposed competitive acquisition program for DMEPOS. However, on October 31, 2014, the CMS released Final Rule 1614-F, “Medicare Program: End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System, Quality Incentive Program, and Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies,” which, in conjunction with Sections 1834(a)(1)(F) and 1842(s)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act, established the methodology to expand competitive bidding to non-bid areas and to implement national price adjustments to payments for DMEPOS and enteral nutrition products previously paid under fee schedules. Under these rules and the resulting expansion plan, CMS applied competitive bidding prices to claims for DMEPOS and enteral nutrition products in previously non-bid areas currently covered in Rounds One, Two and Round Two Recompete of the Competitive Bidding Program (CBP). An un-weighted average of all of the single payment amounts from the CBAs in each of the eight distinct CBAs was used to determine a regional single payment amount (RSPA) for each covered item in each CBA. From January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016, reimbursement rates for affected product categories were reduced significantly, based on the sum of 50 percent of the current unadjusted fee schedule amount plus 50 percent of the RSPAs. Then, on July 1, 2016, the reimbursement rates were reduced further too fully implement the bidding-derived rates (i.e., 100% of the adjusted fee schedule amount, based on regional competitive bidding rates). The January 1, 2017 implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), enacted December 13, 2016, among other things, reinstated the January 1, 2016 reimbursement rates for competitive bid items in non-competitive bidding areas retroactively for the applicable July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 Medicare claims. Accordingly, the impact of the Cures Act led to increased reimbursement for the Pharmacy segment. This legislation contained no provisions to defer or change reimbursement rates effective as of January 1, 2017 and prospectively thereafter, and it does not include any changes to rates in competitive bidding areas. In addition, all DMEPOS CBP contracts expired on December 31, 2018.  Accordingly, as of January 1, 2019, a temporary gap exists in the entire DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program that CMS expects will last until December 31, 2020.  On March 7, 2019, CMS announced plans to consolidate the CBAs included in the Round 2 Recompete and the Round 1 2017 DMEPOS CBP into a single round of competition named Round 2021.  Round 2021 contracts are scheduled to be effective on January 1, 2021 and extend through December 31, 2023. We cannot assure you that our Pharmacy segment will be able to operate its DMEPOS and enteral nutrition products operations profitably in the future at the current reimbursement rates. The MMA also created a Medicare prescription drug benefit (which began in 2006) and a prescription drug card program. Final rules implementing the portions of the MMA relating to the prescription drug benefit were adopted in 2005.
 Under MMA, Medicare Part B, covered drugs and biological products generally are paid based on the average sales price (“ASP”) methodology. The ASP methodology uses quarterly drug pricing data submitted to CMS by drug manufacturers. CMS will supply contractors with the ASP drug pricing files for Medicare Part B drugs on a quarterly basis. Principal products paid under the ASP methodology include certain oncology and renal dialysis drugs. Although, there are exceptions to this general rule which are listed in the latest ASP quarterly change request document and which exceptions generally are paid on a cost basis, such exceptions have not been and are not expected to be material to our operations.
 Beginning in January 2008, CMS’s outpatient prospective payment system began paying for most separately payable Medicare Part B drugs administered in a hospital outpatient setting at a reimbursement level of ASP plus 5% and ASP plus 6% in other settings. Such outpatient price represented a decrease from ASP plus 6%.
 Section 303(d) of the MMA also requires the implementation of a competitive acquisition program (the “Part B CAP”) for Medicare Part B drugs and biological not paid on a cost or prospective payment system basis. The Part B CAP is an alternative to the ASP methodology for acquiring certain Part B drugs which are administered incident to a physician’s services. Currently, the Part B CAP is a voluntary program that offers physicians the option to acquire many injectable and infused drugs they use in their practice from an approved Part B CAP vendor, thus reducing the time and cost of buying and billing for drugs. Currently, the CAP for Part B Drugs and Biologicals is only for injectable and infused drugs currently billed under Part B that are administered in a physician’s office, “incident to” a physician’s service.
 In late 2005, CMS conducted the first round of bidding for approved Part B CAP vendors. The Part B CAP was implemented on July 1, 2006. The 2009-2011 CAP vendor bidding period concluded on February 15, 2008. CMS received several qualified bids; however, contractual issues with the successful bidders resulted in the 2009 program being postponed by CMS in September 2008. As a result, CAP drugs were not available from an approved CAP vendor for dates of service after December 31, 2008.
 At least one Medicaid program has adopted, and other Medicaid programs, some states and some private payors may be expected to adopt, those aspects of the MMA that either result in or appear to result in price reductions for drugs covered by such programs. Adoption of ASP as the measure for determining reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid programs for additional drugs sold by our Pharmacy operations could reduce revenue and gross margins and could materially affect our current average wholesale price (“AWP”) based reimbursement structure with private payors.
 We cannot assure you that the ASP reimbursement methodology will not be extended to the provision of all specialty pharmaceuticals or to the specialty pharmaceuticals most often sold by our Pharmacy segment operations or that our Pharmacy segment will be able to operate profitably at either existing or at lower reimbursement rates. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Part B CAP program will not be extended to rural or exurban areas in general or to the areas in which it operates, or may seek to 
 13

operate, or that the Pharmacy segment would be able to meet the qualifications to become a Part B CAP vendor either now or at any time in the future.
 Non-government Reimbursement Arrangements—Pharmacy
 Major insurance and commercial payors for pharmacy products and services have taken significant steps in recent years to reduce payments for pharmacy products and services and to reduce the involvement of independent pharmacies in an effort to reduce costs and aggregate product distribution into larger volumes in an effort to better bargain prices with pharmacy manufacturers. In addition, pharmacy benefit managers have evolved to act as the intermediary between payors and patients and they also attempt to limit the prices and involvement of independent pharmacies. Also, large retailers, both pharmacy and general retailers, such as Walgreens, CVS and Wal-Mart have established bulk purchasing arrangements with pharmacy manufacturers and exclusive or limited participation agreements with pharmacy benefits managers to reduce the costs and volume of drugs provided by independent retail pharmacies. Further, e-commerce sites, such as Amazon and PillPack, are actively seeking to provide pharmaceuticals and DMEPOS products directly to patients via online ordering and remote fulfillment. These non-government reimbursements arrangements have had a negative effect on our Pharmacy segment. Our pharmacy locations seek to counteract these pressures by providing greater services and convenience locally than is provided by remote pharmacy providers. However, there can be no assurance that these non-government reimbursement arrangements will not have an increasingly negative impact on our Pharmacy segment revenues and profitability in the future.
HEALTHCARE REGULATION
 Overview
 The healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, and there continue to be federal and state proposals that would, and actions that do, impose limitations on government and private payments to providers, including community hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy operations. In addition, there regularly are proposals to increase co-payments and deductibles from program and private patients. Facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay. Such controls include what is commonly referred to as “utilization review”. Utilization review entails the review of a patient’s admission and course of treatment by a third party. Historically, utilization review has resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed. Utilization review is required in connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by Medicare and Medicaid and is also required under many managed care arrangements.
 Many states have enacted, or are considering enacting, additional measures that are designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance. Various states have applied, or are considering applying, for a waiver from current Medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their Medicaid participants through managed care providers. These proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured, and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals, physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under Medicaid.
 Healthcare Facility Regulation
 Certificate of Need Requirements
 A number of states require approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of various healthcare facilities, including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare services. Certificates of Need (“CONs”), which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over applicable healthcare facilities, are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, changes in bed capacity or the addition of services and certain other matters. The state in which a SunLink subsidiary currently operates a hospital and a nursing home (Mississippi) has a CON law that applies to such facility. States periodically review, modify and revise their CON laws and related regulations. Any violation of state CON laws can result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities. SunLink is unable to predict whether its Healthcare Services subsidiaries’ will be able to obtain any CONs that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required.
Utilization Review Compliance and Hospital Governance
 Healthcare services are subject to, and are required to comply with, various forms of utilization review. In addition, under the Medicare prospective payment system, each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of Medicare patient admissions, treatments and discharges in hospitals. Medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility, are overseen by each healthcare facility’s local governing 
 14

board, the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members, and are reviewed by quality assurance personnel. The local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care, develop long-range plans, establish, review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members.
 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
 The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is a federal law that requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency department for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition or is in active labor, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program, the Medicaid program or both. In addition, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital. Although we believe that our subsidiary hospital complies with EMTALA, we cannot predict whether CMS will implement new requirements in the future and whether Trace will be able to comply with any new requirements. Trace does not offer an emergency department.
Pharmacy Segment Regulation
 Overview
 Much like our subsidiaries’ Healthcare Services segment operations, the operations of our Pharmacy segment subsidiary are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations governing their operations, including laws and regulations with respect to the operation of pharmacies, repackaging of drug products, wholesale distribution, dispensing of controlled substances, cross-jurisdictional sale and distribution of pharmacy products, medical waste disposal, clinical trials and non-discriminatory access. Federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs, as well as the dispensing of controlled substances. Federal controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and repackaging facilities with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) and to comply with security, recordkeeping, inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances. Although we believe that the operations of our Pharmacy segment have obtained the permits and/or licenses required to conduct its Pharmacy business as currently conducted, a failure to have the necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse effect on its Pharmacy business, and our financial condition or results of operations.
Pharmaceutical Distribution
 The Pharmacy subsidiary conducts the operations of our Pharmacy segment. In addition to retail pharmacy walk-in customers, it distributes pharmaceuticals through a variety of delivery methods, including by mail and express delivery services. Many states in which our Pharmacy segment delivers or may seek to deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail service pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located.
 However, various state Medicaid programs have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. To the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to the Pharmacy operations of the Pharmacy segment, we believe our Pharmacy operations comply with them in all material respects. To the extent that any of the foregoing laws or regulations prohibit or restrict the operation of mail service pharmacies and are found to be applicable to the Pharmacy operations of the Pharmacy segment, they could have an adverse effect on its ability to expand our pharmacy operations, which currently are concentrated in Louisiana. A number of state Medicaid programs prohibit the participation in such state’s Medicaid program by either out-of-state retail pharmacies or mail order pharmacies, whether located in-state or out-of-state.
 Advertising and Marketing Regulations
 There are also other statutes and regulations which may affect advertising, marketing and distribution of pharmacy products. The Federal Trade Commission requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising, to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold, to fill mail orders within 30 days, and to provide clients with refunds, when appropriate.
 15

General Healthcare Regulations
 Drugs and Controlled Substances
 Various licenses and permits are required by our subsidiaries’ Healthcare Services and Pharmacy segments operations in order to dispense narcotics and operate pharmacies. All of our subsidiaries are required to register our dispensing operations for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with certain operating and security standards of, the United States DEA, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), state Boards of Pharmacy, state health departments and other state agencies in states where we operate or may seek to operate.
 State controlled substance laws require registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure, registration or permit standards promulgated by the state’s pharmacy licensing authority. Such standards often address the qualification of an applicant’s personnel, the adequacy of its prescription fulfillment and inventory control practices and the adequacy of its facilities. In general, pharmacy licenses are renewed annually. Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians employed at each of our dispensing locations also must satisfy applicable state licensing requirements.
 Fraud and Abuse, Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Regulations
 Participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statutes and regulations. If a Healthcare Services or Pharmacy segment operation fails to comply substantially with the numerous federal laws governing such activities, participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs by the applicable subsidiary or even SunLink generally may be terminated and/or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed. For example, a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs if it makes claims to Medicare and/or Medicaid for services not provided or misrepresents actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments; pays money to induce the referral of patients or the purchase of items or services where such items or services are reimbursable under a federal or state health program; fails to report or repay improper or excess payments; or fails to provide appropriate emergency medical screening services to any individual who comes to a hospital’s campus or otherwise fails to properly treat and transfer emergency patients.
 Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focus areas of the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”) of the United States and other governmental fraud and abuse programs and the OIG has issued and periodically updates compliance program guidance for hospitals. Each federal fiscal year, the OIG also publishes a General Work Plan that provides a brief description of the activities that the OIG plans to initiate or continue with respect to the programs and operations of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and details the areas that the OIG believes are prone to fraud and abuse.
 Sections of the Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the “anti-kickback” statute, prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare or other healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by Medicare or other government programs. Sanctions for violating the anti-kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. HHS has issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti-kickback statute. A given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal; however, business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal statutes that are not related to receipt of payments from a federal healthcare program. HIPAA created civil penalties for proscribed conduct, including upcoding and billing for medically unnecessary goods or services. These laws cover all health insurance programs, private as well as governmental. In addition, HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws, such as the anti-kickback statute, to include not just Medicare and Medicaid services, but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program. Finally, HIPAA established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse. These mechanisms include a bounty system, where a portion of the payment recovered is returned to the government agencies, as well as a whistleblower program, where a portion of the payment received is paid to the whistleblower. HIPAA also expanded the categories of persons that may be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.
 16

There is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities, the OIG, the courts and the U.S. Congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient-care referrals and opportunities. Investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction and to reinterpret the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. Enforcement actions have increased, as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities.
 In addition, provisions of the Social Security Act, known as the Stark Act, also prohibit physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements. Certain exceptions are available for employment agreements, leases, physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements. A person making a referral, or seeking payment for services referred, in violation of the Stark Act is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15 for each service; restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims; and/or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare program, which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs.
 Further, if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity, and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity, then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty of up to $100. Compliance with and the enforcing of penalties for violations of these laws and regulations is changing and increasing. For example, CMS has issued a “self-referral disclosure protocol” for hospitals and other providers that wish to self-disclose potential violations of the Stark Act and attempt to resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities at levels below the maximum penalties and amounts set forth in the statute. In light of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that created potential liabilities under the Federal False Claims Act (discussed below) for failing to report and repay known overpayments and return an overpayment within sixty (60) days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later, hospitals and other healthcare providers are encouraged to disclose potential violations of the Stark Act to CMS. It is likely that self-disclosure of Stark Act violations will increase in the future. Finally, many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals, some of which extend beyond the Medicaid program, to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care.
 The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws
 The Federal False Claims Act prohibits providers from, among other things, knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term “knowingly” broadly, and while simple negligence generally will not give rise to liability, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity can constitute the “knowing” submission of a false or fraudulent claim for the purposes of the False Claims Act. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions under the False Claims Act on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of “whistleblower” lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, the defendant will generally not be aware of the lawsuit until the government makes a determination whether it will intervene and take a lead in the litigation. If a provider is found to be liable under the False Claims Act, the provider may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties of between $5 to $11 for each separate false claim. The government has used the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud, such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, submitting false cost reports, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality.
HIPAA Transaction, Privacy and Security Requirements
 HIPAA and federal regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA contain, among other measures, provisions that have required SunLink and our subsidiaries to implement modified or new computer systems, employee training programs and business procedures. The federal regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry, provide for the confidentiality and privacy of patient healthcare information and ensure the security of healthcare information. 
 A violation of the HIPAA regulations could result in civil money penalties of $1 per incident, up to a maximum of $25 per person, per year, per standard violated. HIPAA also provides for criminal penalties of up to $50 and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information, up to $100 and five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses and up to $250 and ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell, transfer or use such information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Since there is limited history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time, it is difficult to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with the HIPAA regulations or the potential for fines and penalties, which may result from any violation of the regulations.
 17

HIPAA Privacy Regulations
 HIPAA privacy regulations protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. The regulations provide increased patient control over medical records, mandate substantial financial penalties for violation of a patient’s right to privacy and, with a few exceptions, require that an individual’s individually identifiable health information only be used for healthcare-related purposes. These privacy standards apply to all health plans, all healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers, such as our subsidiaries’ facilities, that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with standard transactions, and apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form. These standards impose extensive administrative requirements on our subsidiaries’ facilities and require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of such health information, and they require our subsidiaries’ facilities to impose these rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on behalf of our subsidiaries’ facilities. In addition, our subsidiaries’ facilities are subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary by state and could impose stricter standards and additional penalties.
 The HIPAA privacy regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations and standards. In conjunction with a private HIPAA consultant and HIPAA coordinators at each facility, individually tailored policies and procedures were developed and implemented and HIPAA privacy educational programs are presented to all employees and physicians at each facility. We believe all of our subsidiaries’ facilities are in compliance with current HIPAA privacy regulations.
 HIPAA Electronic Data Standards
 The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for all healthcare related electronic data interchange. These provisions are intended to streamline and encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. Among other things, these provisions require Healthcare Services to use standard data formats and code sets established by HHS when electronically transmitting information in connection with certain transactions, including health claims and equivalent encounter information, healthcare payment and remittance advice and health claim status.
 The HHS regulations establish electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers and payors must use when submitting and receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions. The uniform data transmission standards are designed to enable healthcare providers to exchange billing and payment information directly with the many payors thereby eliminating data clearinghouses and simplifying the interface programs necessary to perform this function. We believe that the management information systems at our subsidiaries comply with HIPAA’s electronic data regulations and standards.
 HIPAA Security Standards
 The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of a series of security standards for the protection of electronic health information. The HIPAA security standards rule specifies a series of administrative, technical and physical security procedures for covered entities to use to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information. The standards are delineated into either required or addressable implementation specifications.
 In conjunction with a consortium of rural hospitals, private HIPAA security consultants and HIPAA security officers at each facility, our subsidiaries have performed security assessments and implemented individually tailored plans to apply required or addressable solutions and implemented a set of security policies and procedures. In addition, our subsidiaries developed and adopted an individually tailored comprehensive disaster contingency plan for each facility and presented a HIPAA security training program to all applicable personnel. We believe SunLink and our subsidiaries are in compliance with all aspects of the HIPAA security regulations. 
 HIPAA National Provider Identifier
 HIPAA also required HHS to issue regulations establishing standard unique health identifiers for individuals, employers, health plans and healthcare providers to be used in connection with standard electronic transactions. All healthcare providers, including our facilities, were required to obtain a new National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) to be used in standard transactions instead of other numerical identifiers by May 23, 2007. Our facilities implemented use of a standard unique healthcare identifier by utilizing their employer identification number. HHS has not yet issued proposed rules that establish the standard for unique health identifiers for health plans or individuals. Once these regulations are issued in final form, we expect to have approximately one to two years to become fully compliant, but cannot predict the impact of such changes at this time. We cannot predict whether our facilities may experience payment delays during the transition to the new identifiers. HHS is currently working on the standards for identifiers for health plans; however, there are currently no proposed timelines for issuance of proposed or final rules. The issuance of proposed rules for individuals is on hold indefinitely.
 18

Medical Waste Regulations
 Our operations, especially our Healthcare Services facility operations, generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Our operations are also generally subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. Based on our current level of operations, we do not anticipate that such compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial position or results of operations.
Regulatory Compliance Program
 Our subsidiaries maintain compliance programs under the direction of a risk manager. The compliance programs are directed at all areas of regulatory compliance, including physician recruitment, reimbursement and cost reporting practices, as well as Pharmacy segment operations. Our Healthcare Services and Pharmacy segments’ operations each have one or more compliance officers and develops remediation plans to correct problems should they arise. In addition, all employees are provided with a copy of and given an introduction to the subsidiary’s Code of Conduct, which includes ethical and compliance guidelines and instructions about the proper resources to utilize in order to address any concerns that may arise. Each Healthcare Services and Pharmacy segment operations conduct annual training to re-emphasize its Code of Conduct and monitor its compliance program to respond to developments in healthcare regulations and the industry. A toll-free hotline is also maintained to permit employees to report compliance concerns on an anonymous basis.
Professional Liability
 As part of our business, our subsidiaries are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of operations. To cover a portion of these claims, professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance are maintained in amounts which are commercially available and believed to be sufficient for operations as currently conducted, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect.
 The recorded liability for professional liability risks of our subsidiaries’ operations includes an estimate of liability for claims, including claims retained after the disposition of any facility or operations or claims assumed in connection with the acquisition of any facility or operations. These estimates are based on actuarially determined amounts.
 Environmental Regulation
 We believe our subsidiaries are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental regulations. To date, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or competitive position. Similarly, we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations.
