ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Air Transport Services Group, Inc. leases aircraft and provides airline operations, ground services, aircraft modification and maintenance services, and other support services to the air transportation and logistics industries. Through the Company's subsidiaries, we offer a range of complementary services to delivery businesses, freight forwarders, airlines and government customers. (When the context requires, we may use the terms “Company” and “ATSG” in this report to refer to the business of ATSG and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.) We offer standalone services along with bundled, customized solutions, scalable to our customers' needs. Our services are summarized below.
Aircraft leasing: We lease aircraft through the Company's leasing subsidiary, Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc. (“CAM”). CAM's fleet consists of Boeing 737, 757 and 767 cargo aircraft, Boeing 767 and 777 passenger aircraft and Boeing 757 "combi" aircraft which simultaneously carry passengers and cargo on the main deck. CAM services global demand for cargo airlift by offering Boeing 767, 757 and 737 aircraft leases. CAM is able to provide competitive lease rates by converting passenger aircraft into cargo freighters. CAM monitors the market for available passenger aircraft, typically 15 to 20 years beyond their original manufacture date. After evaluation of an aircraft's condition and technical specifications, CAM acquires passenger aircraft that meet its requirements for projected into-service costs and rate of return targets. After conversion to freighter configuration, CAM's aircraft can be deployed into markets more economically than newly built freighters. CAM's aircraft leases are typically under multi-year agreements. 
Airline operations: We offer combinations of aircraft, crews, maintenance and insurance services to provide customized transportation capacity to our customers. ATSG wholly owns three airlines, ABX Air, Inc. (“ABX”), Air Transport International, Inc. (“ATI”), and Omni Air International, LLC ("OAI") which are each independently certificated by the U.S. Department of Transportation and separately offer services to customers. ABX operates Boeing 767 freighter aircraft, ATI operates Boeing 767 and 757 freighter and Boeing 757 combi aircraft and OAI operates Boeing 767 and 777 passenger aircraft.
Support services:  We provide transportation related services such as aircraft maintenance, crew training and ground handling to delivery companies, freight forwarders and other airlines. Customers who lease our aircraft often need related support services. Offering support services provides us with a competitive advantage for diversification and incremental revenues. Our businesses and subsidiaries providing support services are summarized below: 

• | Ground services: We provide load transfer and sorting services, as well as related maintenance services for material handling equipment, ground equipment and facilities through our LGSTX Services, Inc. (“LGSTX”) subsidiary. LGSTX also rents ground equipment and sells aviation fuel in Ohio. 


• | Aircraft maintenance and modification services: We provide airframe modification and maintenance, component repairs, engineering services and aircraft line maintenance through our subsidiaries Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc. (“AMES”) and Pemco World Air Services, Inc. ("Pemco"). AMES Material Services, Inc. ("AMS") resells and brokers aircraft parts. We provide line maintenance services at certain airports. 


• | Flight support services: We also offer flight crew training. 

The business development and marketing activities of our operating subsidiaries are supported by the Company's Airborne Global Solutions, Inc. ("AGS") subsidiary. AGS markets the various services and products offered by our subsidiaries by bundling solutions that leverage the entire portfolio of our subsidiaries' capabilities and experience in global cargo operations. Our bundled services are flexible and scalable to complement our customers' own resources and support our operational growth. Further, AGS assists our subsidiaries in achieving their sales and marketing plans by identifying their customers' business and operational requirements while providing sales leads. 
Business Development 
The Company is incorporated in Delaware and its headquarters is in Wilmington, Ohio. The Company's common shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol ATSG. ATSG was formed in 2007 for the 
 1

purpose of creating a holding company structure that resulted in its predecessor, ABX, which was incorporated in 1980, becoming a subsidiary of the Company. 
We have had multi-year contracts with DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. and its affiliates ("DHL") since August 2003. In 2010, we entered into commercial agreements with DHL under which DHL leased thirteen Boeing 767 freighter aircraft from CAM and ABX operates those aircraft under a separate crew, maintenance and insurance agreement. The initial term of the operating agreement was five years, while the terms of the aircraft leases were seven years. Effective April 1, 2015, the Company and DHL amended and restated the agreements (together, the "CMI agreement") which extended the Boeing 767 aircraft lease terms and the operation of those aircraft through March 2019. The expiring Boeing 767 aircraft leases and CMI agreement with DHL are expected to be renewed in March 2019 under terms similar to the existing terms. 
On November 9, 2018, we acquired OAI, a passenger airline, along with related entities Advanced Flight Services, LLC; Omni Aviation Leasing, LLC; and T7 Aviation Leasing, LLC (referred to collectively herein as "Omni"). OAI is a leading provider of contracted passenger airlift for the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") via the Civil Reserve Air Fleet ("CRAF") program, and a provider of full-service passenger charter and ACMI services. OAI carries passengers worldwide for a variety of private sector customers and other government services agencies.  The addition of Omni expanded our customer solution offerings primarily through additional passenger transportation capabilities and the authority to operate Boeing 777 aircraft. The acquisition increased the Company's revenues, cash flows and customer diversification. (Additional information about the acquisition of Omni is presented in Note B to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
In September 2015, we began to operate a trial air network for Amazon.com Services, Inc. ("ASI"), the successor to Amazon Fulfillment Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”). We provided cargo handling and logistical support as the network grew to five dedicated Boeing 767 freighter aircraft during 2015. On March 8, 2016, the Company and ASI entered into an Air Transportation Services Agreement (the “ATSA”) which became effective April 1, 2016. Pursuant to the ATSA, CAM leases 20 Boeing 767 freighter aircraft to ASI, including 12 Boeing 767-200 freighter aircraft for a term of five years and eight Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft for a term of seven years. Under the ATSA, ABX and ATI operate those aircraft for an initial term of five years while our LGSTX subsidiary provides gateway services for ASI at certain airports. 
In conjunction with the execution of the original ATSA, the Company and Amazon entered into an Investment Agreement and a Stockholders Agreement, each dated March 8, 2016. The Investment Agreement calls for the Company to issue warrants in three tranches, which will result in Amazon having the right to acquire up to 19.9% of the Company’s outstanding common shares measured as further described below. The first tranche of warrants, issued upon execution of the Investment Agreement, grants Amazon the right to purchase approximately 12.81 million ATSG common shares, all of which are now vested. The second tranche of warrants, which were issued and vested on March 8, 2018, grants Amazon the right to purchase approximately 1.59 million ATSG common shares. The third tranche of warrants will be issued on September 8, 2020 and will also vest immediately upon issuance. The third tranche of warrants will grant Amazon the right to purchase such additional number of ATSG common shares as is necessary to bring Amazon’s ownership to 19.9% of the Company’s pre-transaction outstanding common shares measured on a GAAP-diluted basis, adjusted for share issuances and repurchases by the Company following the date of the Investment Agreement, after giving effect to the issuance of the warrants. Each of the three tranches of warrants will be exercisable in accordance with its terms through the fifth anniversary of the date of the Investment Agreement. The exercise price of the warrants is $9.73 per share, which represents the closing price of ATSG’s common shares on February 9, 2016.
On December 22, 2018 we announced amendments to the agreements with Amazon to 1) lease and operate ten additional Boeing 767-300 aircraft for ASI, 2) extend the term of the 12 Boeing 767-200 aircraft currently leased to ASI by two years to 2023, with an option for three additional years, 3) extend the term of the eight Boeing 767-300 aircraft currently leased to ASI by three years to 2026 and 2027, with an option for three additional years and 4) extend the ATSA for five years through March 2026, with an option to extend for an additional three years. We plan to deliver five of the 767-300 aircraft in 2019 and the remainder in 2020, each under a ten year lease.
In conjunction with the commitment for ten additional 767 aircraft leases, extensions of twenty existing Boeing 767 aircraft leases and the ATSA described above, Amazon will be issued warrants for 14.8 million common shares which could expand its potential ownership in the Company to approximately 33.2%, including the warrants described above for the 2016 agreements.  These new warrants will vest as existing leases are extended and additional aircraft 
 2

leases are executed and added to the ATSA operations. These new warrants will expire if not exercised within seven years from their issuance date. They have an exercise price of $21.53 per share, based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares over the 30 trading days' immediately preceding execution of a non-binding term sheet by the parties on October 29, 2018.
Additionally, Amazon will be able to earn incremental warrant rights, increasing its potential ownership from 33.2% up to approximately 39.9% of the Company, by leasing up to seventeen more cargo aircraft from the Company before January 2026. Incremental warrants granted for Amazon’s commitment to any such future aircraft leases will have an exercise price of the $21.53 referenced above, provided the parties reach binding agreements on future lease terms before April 2019. Beginning in April 2019, the exercise price of incremental warrants related to future aircraft leases will be based on the volume-weighted average price of ATSG’s shares during the 30 trading days immediately preceding the contractual commitment for each lease.
The warrants potentially issuable under these new agreements with Amazon will require an increase in the number of authorized common shares of ATSG. We intend to submit a proposal calling for an appropriate increase in the number of authorized common shares for shareholder consideration at the Company’s next annual meeting of shareholders in May 2019.
In December 2018, we entered into an agreement to acquire twenty Boeing 767-300 extended-range passenger aircraft over the next three years. The aircraft covered by this agreement are currently operated by American Airlines. They were manufactured between 1993 and 2003, and are powered by General Electric CF6-series engines. We will begin to acquire the aircraft during 2019 and currently expect to begin freighter modification of six of the twenty Boeing 767-300 aircraft during 2019, up to nine during 2020, and no fewer than five in 2021.
In January 2014, we acquired a 25 percent equity interest in West Atlantic AB of Gothenburg, Sweden. West Atlantic AB, through its two airlines, Atlantic Airlines Ltd. and West Atlantic Sweden AB, operates a fleet of approximately 40 cargo aircraft. West Atlantic AB operates its aircraft on behalf of European regional mail carriers and express logistics providers. The airlines operate a combined fleet of British Aerospace ATPs, Bombardier CRJ-200-PFs, and Boeing 767 and 737 aircraft. We account for our equity interest under the equity method of accounting.
In December 2016, we acquired Pemco. Pemco provides aircraft maintenance, modification, and engineering services. Pemco is based at the Tampa International Airport where it operates a two-hangar aircraft facility of 311,500 square feet and employs approximately 370 people. Pemco is a leading provider of passenger-to-freighter conversions for Boeing 737-300 and 737-400 aircraft, having redelivered over 50 Boeing 737 converted aircraft to Chinese operators over ten years. Pemco's aircraft conversion capabilities and aircraft hangar operations are marketed with our other air transportation support services.
On August 3, 2017, we entered into a joint-venture agreement with Precision Aircraft Solutions, LLC, to develop a passenger-to-freighter conversion program for Airbus A321-200 aircraft. We anticipate approval of a supplemental type certificate in 2020. We expect to make contributions equal to our 49% ownership percentage of the program's total costs over the next year. We account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
Revenue Information
The Company has three reportable segments, "CAM" which includes aircraft and engine leasing, “ACMI Services" which includes the airlines' operations and "MRO Services." which includes the operations of AMES and Pemco. Our other business operations, including load transfer and package sorting services as well as ground equipment leasing and maintenance do not constitute reportable segments due to their size. Segment revenues for 2018 are summarized below (in thousands):

 | CAM | ACMI Services | MRO Services | Other Support Services
External revenues (in thousands) | $156,516 | $548,804 | $117,832 | $69,193

Customer revenues for 2018 are summarized below. 

 | DHL | Amazon | DoD | Other
Percent of consolidated revenues | 26% | 27% | 15% | 32% 

Revenues include the activities of Omni for periods since its acquisition by the Company on November 9, 2018. Additional financial information about our segments and revenues is presented in Note O to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Description of Business
CAM
CAM leases aircraft to ATSG's airlines and to external customers, including DHL and Amazon, usually under multi-year contracts with a schedule of fixed monthly payments. Under a typical lease arrangement, the customer maintains the aircraft in serviceable condition at its own cost. At the end of the lease term, the customer is typically required to return the aircraft in approximately the same maintenance condition that existed at the inception of the lease, as measured by airframe and engine time and cycles since the last scheduled maintenance event. CAM examines the credit worthiness of potential customers, their short and long-term growth prospects, their financial condition and backing, the experience of their management, and the impact of governmental regulation when determining the lease rate that is offered to the customer. In addition, CAM monitors the customer’s business and financial status throughout the term of the lease.
As of December 31, 2018, CAM’s fleet consisted of 91 serviceable Boeing 777, 767, 757 and 737 passenger and cargo aircraft. A complete list of the Company's aircraft is included in Item 2, Properties. Through CAM and the acquisition of Omni, we have expanded in recent years the Company's combined fleet of Boeing 777, 767, 757 and 737 aircraft. Since the beginning of 2016, CAM has managed the modification of 23 Boeing 767-300 passenger aircraft to a freighter configuration and two Boeing 737 passenger aircraft to a freighter configuration. CAM added two Boeing 767-200 passenger aircraft, six Boeing 767-300 passenger aircraft and three Boeing 777-200 passenger aircraft through the Company's acquisition of Omni on November 9, 2018.
ACMI Services
ACMI Services consists of the operations of the Company's three airline subsidiaries. Through the airlines, we provide airlift operations to DHL, Amazon, the DoD and other transportation customers. A typical operating agreement requires our airline to supply, at a specific rate per block hour and/or per month, a combination of aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance for specified transportation operations. These services are commonly referred to as ACMI, CMI or Charter services depending on the selection of services contracted by the customer. The customer bears the responsibility for capacity utilization and unit pricing in all cases. 
ACMI - The airline provides the aircraft, flight crews, aircraft maintenance and aircraft hull and liability insurance while the customer is typically responsible for substantially all other aircraft operating expenses, including fuel, landing fees, parking fees and ground and cargo handling expenses. 
CMI -The customer is responsible for providing the aircraft, in addition to the fuel and other operating expenses. The airline provides the flight crews, aircraft hull and liability insurance and typically aircraft line maintenance as needed between network flights. 
Charter - The airline is responsible for providing full service, including fuel, aircraft, flight crews, maintenance, aircraft hull and liability insurance, landing fees, parking fees, ground and cargo handling expenses and other operating expenses for an all-inclusive price. 
Our airlines participate in the DoD CRAF Program which allows our airlines to bid for military charter operations for passenger and cargo transportation. Our airlines provide charter operations to the Air Mobility Command ("AMC") through contracts awarded by the U.S. Transportation Command ("USTC"), both of which are organized under the DoD. The USTC secures airlift capacity through fixed awards, which are awarded annually, and through bids for "expansion routes" which are awarded on a quarterly, monthly and as-needed basis. Under the contracts, we are 
 4

responsible for all operating expenses including fuel, landing and ground handling expenses. We receive reimbursements from the USTC each month if the price of fuel paid by us for the flights exceeds a previously set peg price. If the price of fuel paid by us is less than the peg price, then we pay the difference to the USTC. Airlines may participate in the CRAF program either independently, or through teaming arrangements with other airlines. Our airlines are members of the Patriot Team of CRAF airlines. We pay a commission to the Patriot Team, based on certain revenues we receive under USTC contracts. 
ATI contracts with the USTC to operate its unique fleet of four Boeing 757 "combi" aircraft, which are capable of simultaneously carrying passengers and cargo containers on the main flight deck. ATI has been operating combi aircraft for the DoD since 1993. In January 2018, the USTC contracted with ATI to provide combi aircraft operations through December 2021 and awarded ATI three international routes for combi aircraft for 2019. OAI has been operating aircraft for the DoD since 1995. Contracts with the USTC are typically for a one-year period, however, the current passenger international charter contract has a two year term with option periods through September 2024.
Approximately 8% of the Company's consolidated revenues for 2018 were derived from providing airline operations for customers other than DHL, Amazon and the DoD. These ACMI and charter operations are typically provided to delivery companies, freight forwarders, vacation businesses and other airlines.
We provide contracted transportation capacity to our customers. We do not sell passenger travel tickets, nor do we sell individual package delivery services. Our airlines operate wide-body and medium wide-body aircraft usually on intra-continental flights and medium and long range inter-continental flights. The airlines typically operate our freighter aircraft in the customers' regional networks that connect to and from global cargo networks. The aircraft types we operate have lower investment and ongoing maintenance costs and can operate cost efficiently with smaller loads on shorter routes than the larger capacity aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380.
Demand for air transportation services correlates closely with general economic conditions and the level of commercial activity in a geographic area. Stronger general economic conditions and growth in a region typically increase the need for air transportation. Historically, the cargo industry has experienced higher volumes during the fourth calendar quarter of each year due to increased shipments during the holiday season. Generally, time-critical delivery needs, such as just-in-time inventory management, increase the demand for air cargo delivery, while higher costs of aviation fuel generally reduces the demand for air delivery services. When aviation fuel prices increase, shippers will consider using ground transportation if the delivery time allows. 
We have limited exposure to fluctuations in the price of aviation fuel under contracts with our customers. DHL and Amazon, like most of our ACMI customers, procure the aircraft fuel and fueling services necessary for their flights. Our charter agreements with the U.S. Military are based on a preset pegged fuel price and include a subsequent true-up to the actual fuel prices.
Aircraft Maintenance and Modification Services
We provide aircraft maintenance and modification services to other air carriers through our ABX, AMES and Pemco subsidiaries. These subsidiaries have technical expertise related to aircraft modifications through a long history in aviation. They own many Supplemental Type Certificates (“STCs”). An STC is granted by the FAA and represents an ownership right, similar to an intellectual property right, which authorizes the alteration of an airframe, engine or component. We market our subsidiaries capabilities by identifying aviation-related maintenance and modification opportunities and matching them to customer needs.
AMES operates in Wilmington, Ohio, a repair station certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) under Part 145 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, including hangars, a component shop and engineering capabilities. AMES is AS9100 quality certified for the aerospace industry. AMES’ marketable capabilities include the installation of avionics systems and flat panel displays for Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft. The Wilmington facility is capable of servicing airframes as large as the Boeing 747-400 and the Boeing 777 aircraft. AMES , through its Pemco subsidiary, also operates an FAA certificated Part 145 repair station from a two hangar facility in Tampa, Florida. The Tampa location has the capability to perform airframe maintenance on Boeing 767, 757, 737, McDonnell Douglas MD-80, Airbus A320, A321 and various regional jet model aircraft. We have the ability to perform line maintenance and airframe maintenance on McDonnell Douglas MD-80, Boeing 767, 757, 737, 777, 727 and Airbus A320 aircraft. We also have the capability to refurbish airframe components, including approximately 60% of the components utilized by Boeing 
 5

767 aircraft. Through Pemco, we also perform aircraft modification and engineering services, including passenger-to-freighter and passenger-to-combi conversions for Boeing 737-200, Boeing 737-300, Boeing 737-400, and 737-700 series aircraft. 
AMS is an Aviation Suppliers Association, ASA 100 Accredited reseller and broker of aircraft parts. AMS carries an inventory of Boeing 767, 757 and 737 spare parts and also maintains inventory on consignment from original equipment manufacturers, resellers, lessors and other airlines. AMS's customers include the commercial air cargo industry, passenger airlines, aircraft manufacturers and contract maintenance companies serving the commercial aviation industry, as well as other resellers.
Ground Services
Through the Company's LGSTX subsidiaries, we provide labor and management for load transfer and sorting services at certain facilities inside or near airports in the U.S. LGSTX also arranges similar load transfer services to support ASI at certain locations. ASI can terminate these services at one or any location after giving a brief notice period. LGSTX also provides maintenance services for material handling and sorting equipment as well as ground support equipment throughout the U.S. LGSTX has a large inventory of ground support equipment, such as power units, airstarts, deicers and pushback vehicles that it rents to airports, ground handlers, airlines and other customers. LGSTX is also licensed to resell aircraft fuel. Additionally, we provide international mail forwarding services through the John F. Kennedy International Airport and the O'Hare International Airport. 
We provided mail sorting services at various United States Postal Service ("USPS") locations between September 2004 and September 2018. The contracts for the five USPS facilities we serviced were not renewed with us after they expired during September 2018.
Flight Support 
ABX and OAI are FAA certificated to offer flight crew training to customers. ABX has three flight simulators which can be rented for customer outside training programs. The Boeing 767 and DC-9 level C simulators allow ABX to qualify flight crewmembers under FAA requirements without performing check flights in an aircraft. 
Competitive Conditions
Our airline subsidiaries compete with other airlines to place aircraft under ACMI arrangements and charter contracts. Other cargo airlines include Amerijet International, Inc., Atlas Air, Inc., Kalitta Air LLC, Northern Air Cargo, LLC, National Air Cargo Group, Inc., Southern Air, Inc. and Western Global Airlines, LLC. Of these, Atlas Air, Inc. also operates passenger aircraft. The primary competitive factors in the air transportation industry are operating costs, fuel efficiency, geographic coverage, aircraft range, aircraft reliability and capacity. The cost of airline operations is significantly impacted by the cost of flight crewmembers, which can vary among airlines depending on their collective bargaining agreements. Cargo airlines also compete for cargo volumes with passenger airlines that have substantial belly cargo capacity. The air transportation industry is capital intensive and highly competitive, especially during periods of excess capacity of aircraft compared to commercial cargo volumes and DoD requirements. 
The scheduled delivery industry is dominated by integrated door-to-door delivery companies including DHL, the USPS, FedEx Corporation, United Parcel Service, Inc. and ASI. Although the volume of our business is impacted by competition among these integrated carriers, we do not usually compete directly with them.
Competition for aircraft lease placements is generally affected by aircraft type, aircraft availability and lease rates. We target our leases to cargo airlines and delivery companies seeking medium widebody airlift. The Airbus A300-600 and A330 aircraft can provide capabilities similar to the Boeing 767 for medium wide-body airlift. Competitors in the aircraft leasing markets include GE Capital Aviation Services and Altavair Aviation Leasing, among others. 
The aircraft maintenance industry is labor intensive and typically competes based on cost, capabilities and reputation for quality. U.S. airlines may contract for aircraft maintenance with maintenance and repair organizations ("MROs") in other countries or geographies with a lower labor wage base, making the industry highly cost competitive. Other aircraft MROs include AAR Corp and Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co.

Airline Operations
Flight Operations and Control
The Company's airline operations are conducted pursuant to authority granted to each of them by the FAA and the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT"). Airline flight operations, including aircraft dispatching, flight tracking, crew training and crew scheduling are planned and controlled by personnel within each airline. The Company staffs aircraft dispatching and flight tracking 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The FAA prescribes the requirements, methods and means by which air carrier flight operations are conducted, including but not limited to the qualifications and training of flight crew members, the release of aircraft for flight, the tracking of flights, the time crew members can be on duty, aircraft operating procedures, proper navigation of aircraft, compliance with air traffic control instructions and other operational functions.
Aircraft Maintenance
Our airlines’ operations are regulated by the FAA for aircraft safety and maintenance. Each airline performs routine inspections and airframe maintenance in accordance with applicable FAA-approved aircraft maintenance programs. In addition, the airlines build into their maintenance programs FAA-mandated Airworthiness Directive and manufacturer Service Bulletin compliance on all of their aircraft. The airlines’ maintenance and engineering personnel coordinate routine and non-routine maintenance requirements. Each airline’s maintenance program includes tracking the maintenance status of each aircraft, consulting with manufacturers and suppliers about procedures to correct irregularities and training maintenance personnel on the requirements of its FAA-approved maintenance program. The airlines contract with MROs, including AMES and Pemco, to perform heavy maintenance on airframes and engines. Each airline owns and maintains an inventory of spare aircraft engines, auxiliary power units, aircraft parts and consumable items. The quantity of spare items maintained is based on the fleet size, engine type operated and the reliability history of the item types.
Security
The Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) requires ABX and ATI to comply with security protocols as set out in each carrier’s standard all-cargo aircraft operator security plan containing extensive security practices and procedures that must be followed. The security plan provides for the conducting of background checks on those with access to cargo and/or aircraft, the securing of the aircraft while on the ground, the acceptance and screening of cargo to be moved by air, the handling of suspicious cargo and the securing of cargo ground facilities, among other requirements. Comprehensive internal audit and evaluation programs are actively mandated and maintained. In the case of OAI, a passenger carrier, additional requirements apply including passenger and baggage screening, airport terminal security, assessment and distribution of intelligence including the TSA "no-fly" list, and threat response.
Customers are required to inform the airlines in writing of the nature and composition of any freight which is classified as "Hazardous Materials" or “Dangerous Goods” by the DOT. Notwithstanding these procedures, our airline subsidiaries could unknowingly transport contraband or undeclared hazardous materials for customers, or could unknowingly transport an unauthorized passenger or one on possession of an unauthorized item, which could result in fines and penalties and possible damage to the aircraft.
Insurance
Our airline subsidiaries are required by the DOT to carry a minimum amount of aircraft liability insurance. Their aircraft leases, loan agreements and ACMI agreements also require them to carry such insurance. The Company currently maintains public liability and property damage insurance, and our airline subsidiaries currently maintain aircraft hull and liability insurance and war risk insurance for their respective aircraft fleets in amounts consistent with industry standards. CAM’s customers are also required to maintain similar insurance coverage.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 3,830 full-time and part-time employees. The Company employed approximately 770 flight crewmembers, 350 flight attendants, 1,800 aircraft maintenance technicians and flight support personnel, 560 employees for airport maintenance and logistics, 45 employees for sales and marketing and 305 employees for administrative functions. In addition to full time and part time employees, the Company 
 7

typically has approximately 300 temporary employees mainly serving the aircraft line maintenance operations. On December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 3,010 full-time and part-time employees. 
Labor Agreements
The Company’s flight crewmembers are unionized employees. The table below summarizes the representation of the Company’s flight crewmembers at December 31, 2018.

Airline | Labor Agreement Unit | ContractAmendableDate | Percentage ofthe Company’sEmployees
ABX | International Brotherhood of Teamsters | 12/31/2014 | 6.5% 
ATI | Air Line Pilots Association | 11/14/2023 | 6.7% 
Omni | International Brotherhood of Teamsters | 4/1/2021 | 6.9% 
ATI | Association of Flight Attendants | 11/14/2023 | 1.0% 
Omni | Association of Flight Attendants | 12/1/2021 | 8.2% 

Under the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”), as amended, the crewmember labor agreements do not expire, so the existing contract remains in effect throughout any negotiation process. If required, mediation under the RLA is conducted by the National Mediation Board, which has the sole discretion as to how long mediation can last and when it will end. In addition to direct negotiations and mediation, the RLA includes a provision for potential arbitration of unresolved issues and a 30-day “cooling-off” period before either party can resort to self-help, including, but not limited to, a work stoppage.
Training
The flight crewmembers are required to be licensed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (“FARs”), with specific ratings for the aircraft type to be flown, and to be medically certified as physically fit to operate aircraft. Licenses and medical certifications are subject to recurrent requirements as set forth in the FARs, to include recurrent training and minimum amounts of recent flying experience.
The FAA mandates initial and recurrent training for most flight, maintenance and engineering personnel. Mechanics and quality control inspectors must also be licensed and qualified to perform maintenance on Company operated and maintained aircraft. Our airline subsidiaries pay for all of the recurrent training required for their flight crewmembers and provide training for their ground service and maintenance personnel. Their training programs have received all required FAA approvals. Similarly, our flight dispatchers and flight followers receive FAA approved training on the airlines' requirements and specific aircraft.
Intellectual Property
The Company owns many STCs issued by the FAA. The Company uses these STCs mainly in support of its own fleets; however, AMES and Pemco have marketed certain STCs to other airlines.
Information Systems
We are dependent on technology to conduct our daily operations including data processing, communications and regulatory compliance. We rely on critical computerized systems for aircraft maintenance records, flight planning, crew scheduling, employee training, financial records and other processes. We utilize information systems to maintain records about the maintenance status and history of each major aircraft component, as required by FAA regulations. Using the systems, we track maintenance schedules and also control inventories and maintenance tasks, including the work directives of personnel performing those tasks. We rely on information systems to track crewmember flight and duty times, and crewmember training status. The Company’s flight operations systems coordinate flight schedules and crew schedules. 
We invest significant time and financial resources to acquire, develop and maintain information systems to facilitate our operations. Our information technology infrastructure includes security measures, backup procedures and 
 8

redundancy capabilities. We rely increasingly on third party applications and hosted technologies. To remain competitive we must continue to deploy new technologies while controlling its costs and maintaining regulatory compliance. 
Regulation
Our subsidiaries’ airline operations are primarily regulated by the DOT, the FAA and the TSA. Those operations must comply with numerous economic, safety, security and environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. In addition, they must comply with various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations.
Environment
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization ("ICAO"). In 2016, however, the EPA issued a finding on greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions from aircraft and its relationship to air pollution. This finding is a regulatory prerequisite to the EPA’s adoption of a new certification standard for aircraft emissions. Our subsidiaries’ aircraft currently meet all known requirements for engine emission levels as applicable by engine design date. Under the Clean Air Act, individual states or the EPA may adopt regulations requiring reductions in emissions for one or more localities based on the measured air quality at such localities. These regulations may seek to limit or restrict emissions by restricting the use of emission-producing ground service equipment or aircraft auxiliary power units. Further, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered legislation that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future.
In addition, the European Commission has approved the extension of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS") for GHG emissions to the airline industry. Currently, under the European Union’s ETS, all ABX, ATI and OAI flights that are wholly within the European Union are covered by the ETS requirements, and each year our airlines are required to submit emission allowances in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emissions from such flights. If the airline's flight activity during the year produced carbon emissions exceeding the number of carbon emissions allowances that it had been awarded, the airline must acquire allowances from other airlines in the open market. Our airlines operate intra-EU flights from time to time and management believes that such flights are operated in compliance with ETS requirements.
Similarly, in 2016, the ICAO passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. A pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate, and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.
However, the U.S. recently withdrew from the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 196 countries to reduce GHG emissions, and the effect of that withdrawal on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation is uncertain.
The federal government generally regulates aircraft engine noise at its source. However, local airport operators may, under certain circumstances, regulate airport operations based on aircraft noise considerations. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 provides that, in the case of Stage 3 aircraft (all of our operating aircraft satisfy Stage 3 noise compliance requirements), an airport operator must obtain the carriers’ consent to, or the government’s approval of, the rule prior to its adoption. We believe the operation of our airline subsidiaries’ aircraft either complies with or is exempt from compliance with currently applicable local airport rules. However, some airport authorities have adopted local noise regulations, and, to the extent more stringent aircraft operating regulations are adopted on a widespread basis, our airline subsidiaries may be required to spend substantial funds, make schedule changes or take other actions to comply with such local rules.
Department of Transportation
The DOT maintains authority over certain aspects of domestic and international air transportation serving the United States, such as consumer protection, accommodation of passengers with disabilities, requiring a minimum level of insurance and the requirement that a company be “fit” to hold a certificate to engage in air transportation. In addition, the DOT continues to regulate many aspects of international aviation, including the award of certain international routes.

The DOT has issued to ABX a Domestic All-Cargo Air Service Certificate for air cargo transportation between all points within the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The DOT has issued ATI certificate authority to engage in scheduled interstate air transportation, which is currently limited to all-cargo operations. ATI's DOT certificate authority also authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail.  Additionally, the DOT has issued ABX and ATI Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity authorizing each of them to engage in scheduled foreign air transportation of cargo and mail between the U.S. and all current and future U.S. open-skies partner countries, which currently consists of more than 120 foreign countries.  ABX and ATI also hold exemption authorities issued by the DOT to conduct scheduled all-cargo operations between the U.S. and certain foreign countries with which the U.S. does not have an open-skies air transportation agreement. The DOT has issued to OAI a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Interstate Charter Air Transportation and a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for Foreign Charter Air Transportation that authorizes it to engage in interstate and foreign charter air transportation of persons, property and mail.
By maintaining these certificates, the Company, through ABX and ATI, can and currently does conduct all-cargo charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals. Further, the certificates issued to ATI and OAI authorize the air carriers to conduct passenger charter operations worldwide subject to the receipt of any necessary foreign government approvals. Prior to issuing such certificates, and periodically thereafter, the DOT examines a company’s managerial competence, financial resources and plans, compliance disposition and citizenship in order to determine whether the carrier is fit, willing and able to engage in the transportation services it has proposed to and does undertake. 
The DOT has the authority to impose civil penalties, or to modify, suspend or revoke our certificates and exemption authorities for cause, including failure to comply with federal laws or DOT regulations. A corporation or a limited liability company structured like a corporation holding the above-referenced certificates and exemption authorities must continuously qualify as a citizen of the United States, which, pursuant to federal law, requires that (1) it be organized under the laws of the U.S. or a state, territory or possession thereof, (2) that its president and at least two-thirds of its Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, (3) that no more than 25% of its voting interest be owned or controlled by non-U.S. citizens, and (4) that it not otherwise be subject to foreign control. We believe our airline subsidiaries possess all necessary DOT-issued certificates and authorities to conduct our current operations and each continue to qualify as a citizen of the United States.
Federal Aviation Administration
The FAA regulates aircraft safety and flight operations generally, including equipment, ground facilities, maintenance, flight dispatch, training, communications, the carriage of hazardous materials and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA issues operating certificates and detailed "operations specifications" to carriers that possess the technical competence to safely conduct air carrier operations. In addition, the FAA issues certificates of airworthiness to each aircraft that meets the requirements for aircraft design and maintenance. ABX, ATI and OAI believe they hold all airworthiness and other FAA certificates and authorities required for the conduct of their business and the operation of their aircraft. The FAA has the power to suspend, modify or revoke such certificates for cause and to impose civil penalties for any failure to comply with federal laws and FAA regulations.
The FAA has the authority to issue regulations, airworthiness directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, the inspection, maintenance and modification of aircraft and the replacement of aircraft structures, components and parts, based on industry safety findings, the age of the aircraft and other factors. For example, the FAA has required ABX to perform inspections of its Boeing 767 aircraft to determine if certain of the aircraft structures and components meet all aircraft certification requirements. If the FAA were to determine that the aircraft structures or components are not adequate, it could order operators to take certain actions, including but not limited to, grounding aircraft, reducing cargo loads, strengthening any structure or component shown to be inadequate, or making other modifications to the aircraft. New mandatory directives could also be issued requiring the Company’s airline subsidiaries to inspect and replace aircraft components based on their age or condition. As a routine matter, the FAA issues airworthiness directives applicable to the aircraft operated by our airline subsidiaries, and our airlines comply, sometimes at considerable cost, as part of their aircraft maintenance program.
In addition to the FAA practice of issuing regulations and airworthiness directives as conditions warrant, the FAA has adopted new regulations to address issues involving aging, but still economically viable, aircraft on a more systematic basis. FAA regulations mandate that aircraft manufacturers establish aircraft limits of validity and service action 
 10

requirements based on the number of aircraft flight cycles (a cycle being one takeoff and one landing) and flight hours before widespread fatigue damage might occur. Service action requirements include inspections and modifications to preclude development of significant fatigue damage in specific aircraft structural areas. The Boeing Company has provided its recommendations of the limits of validity to the FAA, and the FAA has now approved the limits for the Boeing 757, 767 and 777 model aircraft. Consequently, after the limit of validity is reached for a particular model aircraft, air carriers will be unable to continue to operate the aircraft without the FAA first granting an extension of time to the operator. There can be no assurance that the FAA would extend the deadline, if an extension were to be requested. For the oldest aircraft in our fleets, we estimate the limit of validity would not be reached for at least 20 years. 
The FAA requires each of our airline subsidiaries to implement a drug and alcohol testing program with respect to all employees performing safety sensitive functions and, unless already subject to testing, contractor employees that engage in safety sensitive functions. Each of the Company's airlines complies with these regulations.
Transportation Security Administration
The TSA, an administration within the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for the screening of passengers and their baggage. TSA rules also dictate the manner in which cargo must be screened prior to being loaded on aircraft. Our airline subsidiaries comply with all applicable aircraft, passenger and cargo security requirements. The TSA has adopted cargo security-related rules that have imposed additional burdens on our airlines and our customers. The TSA also requires each airline to perform criminal history background checks on all employees. In addition, we may be required to reimburse the TSA for the cost of security services it may provide to the Company’s airline subsidiaries in the future. The TSA holds (and has exercised) authority to issue regulations, including in cases of emergency the authority to do so without advance notice, including issuance of a grounding order as occurred on September 11, 2001. TSA's enforcement powers are similar to the DOT's and FAA's described above.
International Regulations
When operating in other countries, our airlines are subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or, in the absence of such an agreement, by principles of reciprocity. International aviation agreements are periodically subject to renegotiation, and changes in U.S. or foreign governments could result in the alteration or termination of the agreements affecting our international operations. Commercial arrangements such as ACMI agreements between our airlines and our customers in other countries, may require the approval of foreign governmental authorities. Foreign authorities may limit or restrict the use of our aircraft in certain countries. Also, foreign government authorities often require licensing and business registration before beginning operations. Such authorities have enforcement powers generally similar to those of the U.S. agencies described above.
Data Protection 
There has recently been increased regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and in other countries. For example, the European Union ("E.U.") General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of E.U. law and increases the requirements related to personal data, including individual notice and opt-out preferences and public disclosure of significant data breaches. Additionally, violations of the GDPR can result in significant fines. Other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws, and are considering data localization laws that would govern the use of data outside of their respective jurisdictions. 
Other Regulations
Various regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over significant aspects of our business, and it is possible that new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition to the above, other laws and regulations to which we are subject, and the agencies responsible for compliance with such laws and regulations, include the following:

• | The labor relations of our airline subsidiaries are generally regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which vests in the National Mediation Board certain regulatory powers with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions arising under collective bargaining agreements;

 11


• | The Federal Communications Commission regulates our airline subsidiaries’ use of radio facilities pursuant to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended;


• | U.S. Customs and Border Protection issues landing rights, inspects passengers entering the United States, and inspects cargo imported to the U.S. from our subsidiaries’ international operations, and those operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions;


• | The Company and its subsidiaries must comply with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services regulations regarding the eligibility of our employees to work in the U.S., and the entry of passengers to the U.S.; 


• | The Company and its subsidiaries must comply with wage, work conditions and other regulations of the Department of Labor regarding our employees.


• | The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other government agencies administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy, which may limit our business activities in and for certain areas.
