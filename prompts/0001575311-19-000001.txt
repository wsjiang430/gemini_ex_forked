Item 1. | Business.

Our Company
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms “Brookfield DTLA,” the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” refer to Brookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Investor Inc.
Brookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Investor Inc. (“Brookfield DTLA” or the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013. Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”), and the issuance of shares of 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A preferred stock”) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together, “MPG”). Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“DTLA Holdings”, and together with its affiliates excluding the Company and its subsidiaries, the “Manager”). DTLA Holdings is an indirect partially-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P., a limited partnership under the Laws of Bermuda (“BPY”), which in turn is the flagship listed real estate company of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a corporation under the Laws of Canada (“BAM”).
Brookfield DTLA owns BOA Plaza, EY Plaza, Wells Fargo Center–North Tower, Wells Fargo Center–South Tower, Gas Company Tower and 777 Tower, each of which is a Class A office property located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the “LACBD”) and other investments.
Brookfield DTLA has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) pursuant to Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its tax period ended December 31, 2013. Brookfield DTLA conducts and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT. Accordingly, Brookfield DTLA is not subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that it continues to qualify as a REIT and distributions to its stockholders, if any, generally equal or exceed its taxable income. Brookfield DTLA has elected to treat certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”). Certain activities that we undertake must be conducted by a TRS, such as non-customary services for our tenants, and holding assets that we cannot hold directly. A TRS is subject to both federal and state income taxes.
Brookfield DTLA receives its income primarily from rental income (including tenant reimbursements) generated from the operations of its office and retail properties, and to a lesser extent, from its parking garages.
Corporate Strategy
Brookfield DTLA’s current strategy is to own and invest in commercial properties primarily in the LACBD that are of a high-quality, determined by management’s view of the certainty of receiving rental payments generated by the tenants of those assets.

Competition
Brookfield DTLA competes in the leasing of office space with a number of other real estate companies.
Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning and operating office properties are: the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the LACBD. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.
Segment, Geographical and Tenant Concentration Information
Segment Information—
Brookfield DTLA currently operates in a single reportable segment referred to as its office segment, which includes the operation and management of commercial office properties. Each of Brookfield DTLA’s operating properties is considered a separate operating segment, as each property earns revenues and incurs expenses, individual operating results are reviewed and discrete financial information is available. Management does not distinguish or group Brookfield DTLA’s consolidated operations based on geography, size or type. Brookfield DTLA’s operating properties have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to tenants. As a result, Brookfield DTLA’s operating properties are aggregated into a single reportable segment.
Geographical Information—
All of Brookfield DTLA’s business is conducted in the United States, and it does not derive any revenue from foreign sources.
Tenant Concentration Information—
Brookfield DTLA’s properties are typically leased to high credit-rated tenants for terms ranging from five to ten years, although we also enter into some short-term as well as longer-term leases. As our entire portfolio is located in the LACBD, any specific economic changes within that location could affect our tenant base, and by extension, our profitability.
A significant portion of Brookfield DTLA’s rental income and tenant reimbursements revenue is generated by a small number of tenants. No tenant accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated rental income and tenant reimbursements revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, EY Plaza, BOA Plaza, Wells Fargo Center–North Tower, Wells Fargo Center–South Tower, Gas Company Tower and 777 Tower each contributed more than 10% of Brookfield DTLA’s consolidated revenue. The revenue generated by these six properties totaled 98% of Brookfield DTLA’s consolidated revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Government and Environmental Regulations 
Brookfield DTLA’s office properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA, and we continue to make capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Some of our properties contain, or may have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain, underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Also, some of our properties contain asbestos-containing building materials (“ACBM”). Environmental laws require that ACBM be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. We can make no assurance that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. None of our recent site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
From time to time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) designates certain sites affected by hazardous substances as “Superfund” sites pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Superfund sites can cover large areas, affecting many different parcels of land. The EPA identifies parties who are considered to be potentially responsible for the hazardous substances at Superfund sites and makes them liable for the costs of responding to the hazardous substances. The parcel of land on which Glendale Center (a property that was disposed of by MPG during 2012) is located within a large Superfund site. The site was designated as a Superfund site because the groundwater beneath the site is contaminated. We have not been named, and do not expect to be named, as a potentially responsible party for the site. If we were named, we would likely be required to enter into a de minimis settlement with the EPA and pay nominal damages. 
Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or other environmental site assessments on all of the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey. None of the recent site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Insurance
Properties held by certain Brookfield DTLA subsidiaries and affiliates are covered under insurance policies entered into by the Manager that provide, among other things, all risk property and business interruption coverage for BPY’s commercial portfolio with an aggregate limit of $2.5 billion per occurrence as well as an aggregate limit of $437.5 million of earthquake insurance, and $372.5 million of flood and weather catastrophe insurance. In addition, Brookfield DTLA’s properties are covered by a terrorism insurance policy that provides a maximum of $4.0 billion per occurrence for all of BPY’s U.S. properties. 
To the extent an act or acts of terrorism produce losses in excess of the limits in place, the resulting loss could have a material adverse effect on Brookfield DTLA’s consolidated financial statements. Brookfield DTLA is in compliance with the contractual obligations regarding terrorism insurance contained in such policies. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Our insurance may not cover some potential losses or may not be obtainable at commercially reasonable rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Brookfield DTLA had no employees. The operations and activities of Brookfield DTLA are managed by employees of the Manager.
Corporate Offices
BPY owns the building in which Brookfield DTLA’s operations are managed: 250 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10281, telephone number 212-417-7000. Brookfield DTLA believes that BPY’s current facilities are adequate for Brookfield DTLA’s present needs.
