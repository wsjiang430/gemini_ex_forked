 Company Overview
 
 We are a blank check company formed pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on September 18, 2017 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. While our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial business combination will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we intend to initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the senior housing and care industry in the United States, as described below. We have reviewed, and continue to review, opportunities to enter into an initial business combination with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business on favorable terms or at all.
 
 On November 22, 2017, we consummated the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 6,000,000 units (“Units”), each Unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), one right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination, and one-half of one warrant (“Warrant”), each whole Warrant exercisable to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-220947 and 333-221659) (the “Registration Statements”). The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. The underwriters of the Initial Public Offering were granted an option to purchase an additional 900,000 Units to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-Allotment Units”).
 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Company, on November 22, 2017, we completed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 250,000 units (“Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,500,000. The securities issued in the Private Placement were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Regulation D thereunder, as a sale not involving any public offering.
 
 On November 28, 2017, the underwriters notified us of their exercise of the over-allotment option in full and on November 29, 2017, purchased 900,000 Over-Allotment Units at $10.00 per Unit upon the closing of the over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $9,000,000. Simultaneously with the sale of the additional Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 22,500 placement units (the “Over-Allotment Placement Units”) at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. The securities issued in the Private Placement were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Regulation D thereunder, as a sale not involving any public offering.

 A total of $69,000,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement (including $9,000,000 from the sale of the Over-Allotment Units and Over-Allotment Placement Units) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders. We incurred costs in the aggregate amount of $2,172,419 related to Initial Public Offering including $1,725,000 of underwriting fees and $447,419 of other costs.
 
 Our Units began trading on November 20, 2017 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “BRPAU.” Commencing on December 1, 2017, the underlying shares of Common Stock, Warrants and rights began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “BRPA,” “BRPAW” and “BRPAR,” respectively.
 
 Business Strategy
 
 While our efforts in identifying a prospective target business for our initial business combination will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, we intend to initially focus our search on identifying a prospective target business in the senior housing and care industry in the United States. The senior housing and care industry provides both housing and an array of services to seniors, generally to those over the age of 75. Care segments are commonly divided into four categories:
 
   ●
 Independent Living;


   ●
 Assisted Living;


   ●
 Memory Care; and


   ●
 Nursing Care.


 In the U.S., there currently are approximately 23,400 investment grade senior housing and care properties containing 3 million units. The total value of the investment grade senior housing and care property market is estimated at $372 billion. The average age of residents in senior housing is approximately in the mid-80s, while the average move-in age is in the low to mid-80s. The sizes of the 80+ and 85+ populations are expected to increase at a rate of approximately 1.5%-2% annually during the remainder of the decade. The latter part of the 2020s is expected to see the beginning of significant acceleration in this population, with the 80+ population growth rate averaging roughly 4.5% from 2025 through 2029. As such, we believe there are significant opportunities to acquire senior housing property management companies that are positioned for growth. These operating companies may have leasehold and/or fee ownership of senior housing communities.
 
 We intend to seek out potential targets that enjoy proven business models and attractive growth profiles. We also believe our sponsor’s and management team’s extensive experience in deal sourcing from private and public sources, as well as their capital market expertise, provide unique insight when identifying potential business combination opportunities and creating value. We believe their experience and deep understanding of various markets in the senior housing and care industry positions us to obtain access to potential targets in such markets, frequently in a non-competitive manner and prior to other parties.

 Acquisition Criteria
 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet any of these criteria and guidelines.
 
 We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:
 
   ●
 have strong competitive positions, proven business models, consistent historical financial performance and attractive growth prospects;


   ●
 have limited access to capital markets due to external factors;


   ●
 could benefit from the substantial expertise, experience and network of our sponsor and management team, who could assist with, for example, growth strategy, operations, and the evaluation and integration of acquisitions;


   ●
 are well positioned to participate in sector consolidation and would benefit from a public acquisition currency;


   ●
 would avoid the potentially onerous terms, such as liquidation preferences, that are often characteristic of late state private growth financing rounds; and


   ●
 offer attractive risk-adjusted returns.


 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our management may deem relevant.

 Competitive Strengths
 
 We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
 
 Status as a public company
 
 We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

 While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These inherent limitations include limitations on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek shareholder approval of a business combination or conduct a tender offer in relation thereto, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding warrants, which may represent a source of future dilution.
 
 Financial position
 
 With funds in the trust account of approximately $69 million available to use for a business combination (assuming no stockholder seeks conversion of their shares or seeks to sell their shares to us in a tender offer in relation to such business combination), we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing if we are forced to use a significant portion of such funds for converting or tendering stockholders and there can be no assurance that it will be available to us.
 
  Offering Structure
 
  Unlike some other blank check companies that sell units comprised of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase a full share of common stock in their initial public offerings, our initial public offering was for units comprised of one share of common stock, one-half of one warrant and one right which entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of our initial business combination. Because the number of shares ordinarily issuable upon exercise of the warrants found in the typical structure of some other blank check initial public offerings is less in our case (since such warrants most often entitle the holder thereof to receive a full share of common stock as opposed to the one-tenth (1/10) of one share the rights entitle a holder to receive and the one-half of one share of common stock that each warrant holder is entitled to purchase), our management believes we will be viewed more favorably by potential target companies when determining which company to engage in a business combination with. However, our management may be incorrect in this belief.

 Our Management Team
 
 We will seek to capitalize on the significant investing and operating experience and contacts of our officers and directors in consummating an initial business combination. Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Ackerman, has over 35 years of real estate experience with 18 years in senior housing. Prior to starting Big Rock Partners (“BRP”), an opportunistic real estate investment firm founded in 2004 that has invested in and managed over $800 million in assets since its formation, Mr. Ackerman was Head of the Los Angeles office for Apollo Real Estate Advisors (“Apollo”), a global private equity firm. Our Chief Financial Officer, Lori Wittman, also has over 35 years of real estate experience and was most recently the Chief Financial Officer of Care Capital Properties (“CCP”), a public healthcare real estate investment trust with a diversified portfolio of triple-net leased properties focused on the post-acute sector, which merged with Sabra Healthcare REIT, Inc. Prior to CCP, Ms. Wittman was Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations at Ventas, Inc., a leading real estate investment trust with a diverse portfolio of more than 1,600 assets in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom consisting of seniors housing communities, medical office buildings, skilled nursing facilities, hospitals and other properties. Our Chief Investment Officer and Corporate Secretary, Bennett Kim, has over 20 years of real estate experience and worked with Mr. Ackerman at Apollo. Through BRP, Messrs. Ackerman and Kim are currently developing $200 million of senior housing in Florida, which consists of independent living, assisted living and memory care. Also, our independent directors, Richard Birdoff, Michael Fong, Stuart Koenig, Albert G. Rex and Troy T. Taylor, have significant experience in private investments, ownership and management of businesses of many types, large and small.
 
 While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector and in any region, we intend to focus on industries that complement our management team’s background so we can capitalize on their ability to identify, acquire, and operate a business. We therefore intend to initially focus on companies in the senior housing and care industry in the United States; however, we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that is not connected to the senior housing and care industry.
 
 We believe our sponsor’s and management team’s deal sourcing, investing, and operating expertise, as well as their network of contacts will position us to take advantage of opportunities in the senior housing and care industry. We believe this expertise and network of contacts will allow us to generate a number of acquisition opportunities. We believe there are a number of high quality senior housing businesses with adequate scale to be attractive public companies.

 Effecting a Business Combination
 
  General
 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time following the Initial Public Offering. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination which has not yet been identified. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
 
 We will have until May 22, 2019 to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
 We Have Not Identified a Target Business
 
 We have reviewed, and continue to review, opportunities to enter into an initial business combination with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business on favorable terms or at all.
 
 Subject to our officers’ and directors’ pre-existing fiduciary duties and the limitation that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, we will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective acquisition candidate. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption “Business Strategy,” we have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. To the extent we effect a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.

 Our Acquisition Process
 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We also expect to utilize our management team’s operational and capital markets experience.
 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
 Sources of Target Businesses
 
 We expect that our principal means of identifying potential target businesses will be through the extensive contacts and relationships of our officers and directors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, our officers and directors believe that the relationships they have developed over their careers and their access to their contacts and resources will generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. They must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income accrued in the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations. We have engaged a professional firm that specializes in business acquisitions, and we may engage other firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our sponsor, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the monthly administrative services fee of up to $10,000, the repayment of any loans from our sponsor, officers and directors for working capital purposes and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. We are not restricted from entering into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.

 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
 
 Subject to our officers’ and directors’ pre-existing fiduciary duties and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption “Acquisition Criteria,” we have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:
 
   ●
 financial condition and results of operation;


   ●
 growth potential;


   ●
 brand recognition and potential;


   ●
 experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;


   ●
 capital requirements;


   ●
 competitive position;


   ●
 barriers to entry;


   ●
 stage of development of the products, processes or services;


   ●
 existing distribution and potential for expansion;


   ●
 degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services


   ●
 proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;


   ●
 impact of regulation on the business;


   ●
 regulatory environment of the industry;


   ●
 costs associated with effecting the business combination;


   ●
 industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and


   ●
 macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.


 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.
 
 The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination can only be estimated at this time. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.

 Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
 The target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance.
 
 We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
 We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.

 Lack of Business Diversification
 
 We may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, and there is no required minimum valuation standard for any target at the time of such acquisition. We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 
   ●
 subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and


   ●
 result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.


 If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses, and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.
 
 Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’s Management
 
 Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’s management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is possible that they will not devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and will likely provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
 Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.

 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
 In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combination even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
 We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 
 Our sponsor, officers, directors and the Investor (as defined below) have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, including the founder’s shares, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 2,382,251, or approximately 34.5%, of the 6,900,000 public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all shares were present and entitled to vote at the meeting, and that the 120,000 shares to be issued to EarlyBirdCapital upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering are voted in favor of the transaction).
 
 None of our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
 Conversion Rights
 
 At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid (which taxes may be paid only from the interest earned on the funds in the trust account). Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.
 
 We may require public stockholders seeking conversion, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.
 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.

 Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.
 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures historically used by some blank check companies. Traditionally, in order to perfect conversion rights in connection with a blank check company’s business combination, the company would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his conversion rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the conversion price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the conversion rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become a “continuing” right surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a holder’s election to convert his shares is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
 Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share of common stock delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the proposed business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
 If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
 
  Extensions to Complete Business Combination
 
 On November 17, 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the sponsor and BRAC Lending Group LLC (the “Investor”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the sponsor transferred an aggregate of 1,500,000 founder’s shares to the Investor in exchange for the agreements set forth below and aggregate cash consideration of $1.00. Pursuant to the Agreement, the sponsor agreed to take all actions reasonably necessary to extend the period of time the Company has to consummate a business combination up to two times for an aggregate of up to six months and the Investor agreed to loan us the funds necessary to obtain the extensions (the “Extension(s)”). On November 20, 2018, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “First Note”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000, to provide us the funds necessary to obtain the first three-month Extension. On November 20, 2018, we issued a press release announcing that we had obtained the first three-month Extension to complete a business combination from November 22, 2018 to February 22, 2019. On February 21, 2019, the Company issued a second unsecured promissory note (the “Second Note, and together with the First Note, the “Notes”) in favor of the Investor, in the original principal amount of $690,000, to provide us the funds necessary to obtain the second three-month Extension. On February 22, 2019, we issued a press release announcing that we had obtained the second three-month Extension to complete a business combination from February 22, 2019 to May 22, 2019.

 Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investor has also agreed to loan the Company all funds necessary to pay expenses incurred in connection with and in order to consummate a business combination (the “Business Combination Expenses”) and such loans will be added to the Notes. Also, pursuant to the Agreement, the sponsor has agreed to be responsible for all liabilities of the Company as of November 17, 2018, except for liabilities associated with the possible redemption of shares by the Company’s shareholders, as described in the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The sponsor has also agreed to loan us the funds necessary to pay the expenses of the Company other than the Business Combination Expenses through the closing of a business combination when and as needed in order for the Company to continue in operation (the “Non-Business Combination Related Expenses”). Upon consummation of a business combination, up to $200,000 of the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be repaid by us to the sponsor provided that the Company has funds available to it sufficient to repay such expenses (the “Cap”) as well as to pay for all stockholder redemptions, all Business Combination Expenses, repayment of the Note, and any funds necessary for the working capital requirements of the Company following closing of the business combination. Any remaining amounts in excess of the Cap will be forgiven. If the Company does not consummate a business combination, all outstanding loans made by the sponsor to cover the Non-Business Combination Related Expenses will be forgiven.
 
 The founder’s shares transferred by the sponsor to the Investor will remain in escrow in the name of the Investor, subject to the terms of the Stock Escrow Agreement, dated November 20, 2017, among the Company, the Sponsor and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. Additionally, the Sponsor assigned the registration rights it was granted, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 20, 2017 between the Company and the sponsor, with respect to the founder’s shares to the Investor in connection with the transfer.
 
 Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
 If we have not completed an initial business combination by May 22, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would restrict our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time) unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.
 
 Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.

 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 12-month anniversary of the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18-months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time), and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.
 
 We are required to use our reasonable best efforts to have all third parties and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you of this fact as there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Our underwriters and auditor are the only third parties we are currently aware of that may not execute a waiver. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. A/Z Property Partners, LLC ("A/Z Property"), an entity majority owned by Richard Ackerman, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. We believe A/Z Property has sufficient net worth to satisfy its indemnity obligation should it arise, however we cannot assure you that A/Z Property will have sufficient liquid assets to satisfy such obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement entered into by A/Z Property specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable.
 
   
14


  
 
 We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effect such a distribution. Our sponsor has waived its rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the founder’s shares and any shares, rights or warrants included in the private placement units. Additionally, any loans made by our officers, directors, sponsors or their affiliates for working capital needs will be forgiven and not repaid if we are unable to complete an initial business combination. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our rights or warrants, including the rights or warrants contained in the private placement units, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, A/Z Property has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.
 
 If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
 
 Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation as described elsewhere herein. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
 
 If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.
 
 If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after the expiration of the time we have to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

 Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would restrict our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time), we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founder’s shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:
 
   ●
 we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;


   ●
 we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;


   ●
 if our initial business combination is not consummated within 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by the full amount of time), then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;


   ●
 upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, $60.0 million, or approximately $69.0 million if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, shall be placed into the trust account;


   ●
 we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and


   ●
 prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the

 Competition
 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
 
 The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 
   ●
 our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;


   ●
 our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and


   ●
 our outstanding rights or warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent.


 Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
 If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
 Employees
 
 We have three executive officers who receive no compensation from the Company. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process of the company. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.

 Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
 We have registered our units, common stock, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this 2018 Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
 We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
