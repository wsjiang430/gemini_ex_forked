Several competitors are also customers for our products, such as Honeywell, Parker Hannifin, and Collins Aerospace.
We believe our products offer high levels of field reliability, which provides end users with an advantage in life-cycle cost. We address competition in aftermarket service through responsiveness to our customers’ needs, providing short turnaround times, greater performance such as longer time between repairs, and maintaining a global presence. 
Some of our customers are affiliated with our competitors through ownership or joint venture agreements. For example, Pratt and Whitney, one of our customers, is affiliated with Collins Aerospace, one of our competitors. Similarly, GE Aviation has a joint venture with Parker Hannifin for the supply of fuel nozzles. In the past, we also have partnered with our customers. During fiscal year 2016, we entered into a strategic joint venture (“JV”) with our largest customer, General Electric Company (“GE”), acting through its GE Aviation business unit. The JV primarily develops, manufactures and supports fuel systems for twin aisle aircraft engines and is described further in Note 6, Joint venture, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
We compete in part by establishing relationships with our customers’ engineering organizations, and by offering innovative technical and commercial solutions to meet their market requirements. Our ability to design, develop and test an integrated system with a customer is a competitive differentiator, offering the customer savings in both resources and time. 
Industrial operates in the global markets for industrial turbines, industrial reciprocating engines, electric power generation systems (including wind turbines), power distribution networks, transportation, and oil and gas. Many of these markets are subject to regulatory product and performance certifications to meet emissions and safety requirements, which form a basis for competition as well as a barrier to entry. 
We compete with numerous companies that specialize in various engine, turbine, and power management products, and our OEM customers are often capable of developing and manufacturing similiar products internally. Many of our customers are large global OEMs that require suppliers to support them around the world and to meet increasingly higher requirements in terms of safety, quality, delivery, reliability and cost. 
Competitors include Emerson, EControls, Heinzmann GmbH & Co., Hoerbiger, Meggitt, Robert Bosch AG, Schweitzer Electric, and Triconix. OEM customers with internal capabilities for similar products include Caterpillar, Cummins, General Electric, Rolls-Royce Power Systems, Wärtsilä, and Weichai. 
We believe we are a market leader in providing our customers advanced technology and superior product performance at a competitive price. We focus on developing and maintaining close relationships with our OEM customers’ engineering teams. Competitive success is based on the development of innovative components and systems that are aligned with the OEMs’ technology roadmaps to achieve future reliability, emission, efficiency, and fuel flexibility targets. 
Government Contracts and Regulation
Portions of our business, particularly in our Aerospace segment, are heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), and the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Transportation. We also contract with similar government authorities outside the United States, subject in all cases to applicable law.
The U.S. Government, and potentially other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts, or any government contracts under which we are a subcontractor, at their convenience, as well as for default based on specified performance measurements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for our default, the U.S. Government generally would pay only for the work accepted, and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract 

 
items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government could also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.
We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things:
require accurate, complete and current disclosure and certification of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contracts; 
impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), and therefore require robust systems to reconcile;
impose regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts; 
impose manufacturing specifications and other quality standards that may be more restrictive than for non-government business activities; and
restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes due to the regulations of the U.S. Government and foreign governments pertaining to the export of certain products and technical data.
Sales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers utilizing Woodward parts and subassemblies, collectively represented 23% of our sales for each of the fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017. The level of U.S. spending for defense, alternative energy and other programs, and the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated, is subject to periodic congressional appropriation actions, and is subject to change, including elimination, at any time. 
U.S. Government related sales from our reportable segments for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:


 | Direct U.S. Government Sales | | Indirect U.S. Government Sales | | Commercial Sales | | Total

Seasonality
We do not believe our sales, in total or in either business segment, are subject to significant seasonal variation. However, our sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to the immediately preceding quarter due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays and scheduled plant shutdowns for annual maintenance. 
Sales Order Backlog
Beginning in fiscal year 2019, for each of our reportable segments, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner consistent with the definition of remaining performance obligations under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). 

 5


Our remaining performance obligations by segment, excluding material rights, as of October 31, 2019 and our sales order backlog on firm sales orders by segment as of October 31, 2018 is shown in the table below. For further discussion of our material rights obligations, refer to Note 3, Revenue, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”


 | October 31, 2019 | | % Expected to be filled by September 30, 2020 | | October 31, 2018
Aerospace | $ | 949,520 | | 65 | % | $ | 1,355,635
Industrial | | 353,983 | | 95 | | | 292,897 
 | $ | 1,303,503 | | 73 | % | $ | 1,648,532

Our remaining performance obligations as of October 31, 2019 relate to the aggregate amount of the total contract transaction price of firm orders for which the performance obligation has not yet been recognized in revenue. Our sales order backlog as of October 31, 2018 was based on unshipped firm sales orders that were open in our order entry systems. 
Manufacturing
We operate manufacturing and assembly plants in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our products consist of mechanical, electronic and electromechanical systems and components. 
Aluminum, iron and steel are primary raw materials used to produce our mechanical components. Other commodities, such as gold, copper and nickel, are also used in the manufacture of our products, although in much smaller quantities. We purchase various goods, including component parts and services used in production, logistics and product development processes from third parties.  Generally there are numerous sources for the raw materials and components used in our products, which we believe are sufficiently available to meet current requirements.
We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and efficiently managing our overall supply costs. We expect our suppliers to maintain adequate levels of quality raw materials and component parts, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support production of our various products.  We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to protect our intellectual property and processes and to monitor and mitigate risks of disruption in our supply base that could cause a business disruption to our production schedules or to our customers.  The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, business continuity, quality, delivery and protection of our intellectual property and processes.
Our customers expect us to maintain adequate levels of certain finished goods and certain component parts to support our warranty commitments and sales to our aftermarket customers, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support our customers’ standard and customary needs. We carry certain finished goods and component parts in inventory to meet these rapid delivery requirements of our customers. 
We are subject to rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding disclosure related to a company’s use of tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold or their derivatives (collectively referred to as “conflict minerals”) in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event the conflict minerals come or may come from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. The European Union has adopted similar reporting obligations that will be effective in 2021. Our conflict minerals report for calendar year 2018 was filed with the SEC on May 30, 2019. We may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we use and/or are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the conflict minerals used in our products. Further, due to the complexity of our supply chain, the implementation of the existing U.S. requirements and any additional European requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a number of parts contained in our products. We have and will continue to incur costs associated with compliance, including time-consuming and costly efforts to determine the source of conflict minerals that may be used in our products.
Research and Development
We finance our research and development activities primarily with our own independent research and development funds. Our research and development costs include basic research, applied research, component and systems development, and other concept formulation studies. 
Company funded expenditures related to new product development activities are expensed as incurred and are separately reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Across both of our segments, research and development costs totaled $159,107 in fiscal year 2019, $148,279 in fiscal year 2018, and $126,519 in fiscal year 2017. Research and development costs were 5.5% of consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2019 compared to 6.4% in fiscal year 2018 and 6.0% in 

 
fiscal year 2017. See “Research and development costs” in Note 1, Operations and summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
Aerospace is focused on developing systems and components that we believe will be instrumental in helping our customers achieve their objectives of lower fuel consumption, lighter weight, more efficient performance, reduced emissions, and improved operating economics. We support our engine and airframe customers as they develop next generation designs across the commercial aviation, general aviation, civil private and military markets. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:
aerospace turbine engine applications, which include commercial, business and military turbofan engines of various thrust classes, turboshaft engines and turboprop engines;
electromechanical and hydraulic actuation systems for flight deck-to-flight surface control of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, and turbine engine nacelles, as well as guidance for weapon systems; and 
motion control components for integration into comprehensive actuation systems.
The aerospace industry has moved toward more electric (“fly-by-wire”), lighter weight aircraft, while demanding increased reliability and redundancy. In response, we are developing an expanded family of intelligent flight deck control products (including throttle and rudder controls) with both conventional and fly-by-wire technology, as well as motor driven actuation systems.
We collaborate closely with our customers as they develop their technology plans, which leads to new product concepts. We believe this collaboration allows us to develop technology that is aligned with our customers’ needs and therefore, increases the likelihood that our systems and components will be selected for inclusion in the platforms developed by our customers. Further, we believe our close collaboration with our customers during preliminary design stages allows us to provide products that deliver the component and system performance necessary to bring greater value to our customers. This preliminary work may include opportunities to test new products in order to validate concepts and demonstrate performance in challenging environments. 
Most technology development programs begin years before an expected entry to service, such as those for the next generation of commercial aircraft. Other development programs result in nearer-term product launches associated with new OEM offerings, product upgrades, or product replacements on existing programs. Some of the major projects/programs we are developing are listed below.
We developed the fuel system, air management system, and actuation hardware for CFM International’s LEAP engine program. We also developed actuation system, combustion system and oil system components for Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbo Fan (“GTF”) engine program. These programs target applications in the single aisle and regional aircraft markets with entry into service in the 2016 to 2020 timeframe. Both the LEAP engine and the GTF engine (later named the PurePower engine) have been selected by Airbus as options to power its A320neo aircraft, which entered service in 2016. In addition, the LEAP engine was selected by Boeing exclusively for its 737 MAX, which entered service in 2017, and by Comac for its C919 aircraft, which is currently in flight test. The GTF engine was selected by Bombardier exclusively for its CSeries aircraft (now majority owned by Airbus and renamed the A220), which entered service in 2016 and is currently in production. The GTF engine was also chosen by Embraer for its EJets E2 aircraft family, which entered service in 2018, by Mitsubishi for the MRJ regional aircraft and by Irkut for the MS-21 aircraft. The MRJ and MS-21 aircraft are currently in flight test. 
The JV with GE primarily develops, manufactures and supports fuel systems for twin aisle aircraft engines. The JV is developing the fuel system for the GE9X engine (which will power the Boeing 777X). We have been selected as the JV’s supplier of this fuel system.
We are the supplier for the thrust reverser actuation system (“TRAS”) for the Boeing 737 MAX and the CFM LEAP-engined Airbus A320neo. We are developing the TRAS for the Boeing 777X and the Airbus A330neo, as well as the TRAS on the new nacelle version of the GTF engine to be used on the Airbus A320neo. The A330neo entered service in 2018, and the 777X is projected to enter service in late 2020.
We developed the fuel system, air management components, and actuation hardware for the Passport engine program, as well as the TRAS for the integrated propulsion system. Passport is the next generation GE Aviation engine for the large business aviation market, and has been selected by Bombardier to power its Global 7500 long-range business aircraft, which entered service in 2018.
In addition, we developed sensor solutions for the Airbus A350 high lift system, an actuation sub-system for the Boeing 787-9 that improves fuel burn, flight deck control components for the Airbus A220 and control and sensing solutions for the 

 
Boeing KC-46A refueling tanker boom subsystem. We developed flight deck control components for the Bombardier Global 7500 aircraft, as well as other business aviation aircraft.
Industrial is focused on developing innovative technologies, including integrated control systems and system components, that enable our customers to cost-effectively meet mandated emissions regulations and fuel efficiency demands, allow for usage of a wider range of fuel sources, increase reliability (particularly in harsh environments), and reduce total cost of ownership. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:
products that improve the quality of combustion processes and provide more precise flow of various fuels and gases in our customers’ gas turbines and industrial reciprocating engines; 
electronic devices and software solutions that provide improved control and protection of reciprocating engines, gas turbines, steam turbines, wind turbines, and engine- and turbine-powered equipment; and 
advanced prognostic and predictive intelligence that is integrated into many of our complex products and systems. 
These development efforts support our strategy of being the recognized market leader for:
application and control solutions for any machine that produces electricity utilizing conventional and renewable energy sources; and
control solutions for complex oil and gas, industrial and transportation applications.
We collaborate closely with our customers to jointly align our technology roadmaps. This collaboration allows us to develop new systems, products and technologies consistent with our customers’ future needs for performance, emissions and efficiency to deliver greater value. We strive to stay ahead of the competition through our modeling, prototyping, and state of the art test capabilities. 
We partner with our customers on programs that can take months or years of development before being fully validated and launched into production. We also work with our customers on shorter term application programs for product and system upgrades. Some of the major projects/programs we are developing include:
high pressure common rail diesel fuel injection systems; 
natural gas metering and combustion systems; 
comprehensive electronic control and air management solutions for natural gas and diesel engines;
emission certified stationary and mobile gas engine systems; 
heavy frame and aeroderivative electric actuation systems enabling turbine electrification with cyber secure products; 
steam turbine controls and valves that greatly simplify installation and significantly improve reliability; and
next generation full size wind turbine converters.
Employees
As of October 31, 2019, we employed approximately 9,000 full-time employees of which approximately 3,000 were located outside of the United States, with the majority in Germany, Poland and China. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
Approximately 12% of our total full-time workforce were union employees as of October 31, 2019, all of whom work for our Aerospace segment and are located in the United States. The collective bargaining agreements with our union employees are generally renewed through contract renegotiation near the contract expiration dates. The MPC Employees Representative Union contract, which covers 611 employees as of October 31, 2019, expires October 1, 2021. The Local Lodge 727-N International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreement, which covers 490 employees as of October 31, 2019, expires April 22, 2021. The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and Local No. 509 agreement, which covered no employees as of October 31, 2019, expires June 4, 2021. We believe that our relationships with our union employees and the representative unions are good.
Almost all of our other employees in the United States were at-will employees as of October 31, 2019, and therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Our executive officers each have change-in-control agreements which have been filed with the SEC.

 

Outside of the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary, including coordination through local works’ councils. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.
Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing
We own numerous patents and other intellectual property, and have licenses for the use of patents and other intellectual property owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. Government has certain rights in our patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of certain government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes as allowed by law. 
Intellectual property not covered by patents (or patent applications) includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. Such unpatented technology, including research, development and engineering technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented software, is important to our overall business and to the operations of each of our segments. 
While our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business or either of our segments would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. 
As of September 30, 2019, our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes $611,922 of net intangible assets. This value represents the carrying values, net of amortization, of certain assets acquired in various business acquisitions and does not purport to represent the fair value of our acquired intellectual property as of September 30, 2019. 
U.S. GAAP requires that research and development costs be expensed as incurred; therefore, as we develop new intellectual property in the normal course of business, the costs of developing such assets are expensed as incurred, with no corresponding intangible asset recorded. Customers sometimes pay consideration to Woodward for product engineering and development activities that do not result in the immediate transfer of distinct products or services to the customer. For Woodward’s accounting policy with regards customer funded product engineering and development activities, see Note 3, Revenue, to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Environmental Matters and Climate Change
The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.
We use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We believe that the risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. From time to time we engage in environmental remedial activities, generally in coordination with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. In formulating that estimate and recognizing those costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies, or others, until such recovery is assured. Currently, we have no sites undergoing remediation. 
Our manufacturing facilities generally do not produce significant volumes or quantities of byproducts, including greenhouse gases, that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment. We do not expect legislation currently pending or expected in the next several years to have a significant negative impact on our operations in any of our segments. 
Domestic and foreign legislative initiatives on emissions control, renewable energy, and climate change tend to favorably impact the sale of our energy control products. For example, our Industrial segment produces inverters for wind turbines and energy control products that help our customers maximize engine efficiency and minimize wasteful emissions, including greenhouse gases.
