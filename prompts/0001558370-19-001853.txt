 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing peptide-based product candidates to address significant unmet medical needs in hematology and gastroenterology.  
 Figure 1: Our Product Pipeline 


 
  1

 

 In hematology, our most advanced clinical product candidate, PTG-300, is under development for the treatment of certain rare blood disorders characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, excessive red blood cells or iron overload. PTG-300 is an injectable compound that mimics the effect of the natural hormone hepcidin, but with greater potency, solubility and stability. Hepcidin is a key hormone in regulating iron equilibrium and is critical to the proper development of red blood cells. We are currently developing PTG-300 for the treatment of chronic anemia and iron overload, with an initial focus on beta-thalassemia non-transfusion dependent and transfusion dependent  patients where the primary endpoints are hemoglobin increases and transfusion reductions, respectively. PTG-300 has received an orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and European Union (“EU”) regulatory authorities. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to PTG-300 for the treatment of beta-thalassemia. In the first quarter of 2019, we began dosing patients in a global Phase 2 study of PTG-300 in beta-thalassemia. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in a second indication in the second half of 2019. 
 In gastroenterology our clinical stage product candidates, PTG-200 and PN-943, are potential first-in-class oral drugs currently in development for inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), a GI disease consisting primarily of ulcerative colitis (“UC”) and Crohn’s disease (“CD”), that block biological pathways currently targeted by marketed injectable antibody drugs. Our orally stable peptide approach offers targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal (“GI”) tissue compartment. We believe that, compared to antibody drugs, these product candidates have the potential to provide improved safety due to minimal exposure in the blood, increased convenience and compliance due to oral delivery, and the opportunity for the earlier introduction of targeted therapy. As a result, if approved, they may transform the existing treatment paradigm for IBD.  
 PTG-200 is a potential first-in-class oral Interleukin-23 receptor (“IL-23R”) antagonist for the treatment of IBD. We have entered into a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), a Johnson & Johnson company, to co-develop and co-detail PTG-200 for all indications, including IBD. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. In 2018, we completed a Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PTG-200 in healthy volunteers. We expect Janssen to file a U.S. Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for PTG-200 in CD in the first half of 2019.
 PN-943, a potential first-in-class oral, alpha-4-beta-7 (“α4β7”) specific integrin antagonist, is currently in a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy volunteers to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We developed PN-943 as a more potent oral gut-restricted α4β7 backup compound to PTG-100, our first generation oral gut-restricted α4β7 inhibitor that was being developed for treatment of ulcerative colitis. In March 2018, we announced the discontinuation of a global Phase 2 clinical trial of PTG-100 in patients with moderate to severe UC due to futility following a planned interim analysis by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. In August 2018, we announced that an independent, blinded re-read of endoscopies from the study had demonstrated signals of clinical efficacy. A human error in the initial endoscopy reads by the original vendor which was characterized by an unusually high placebo effect led to the original futile outcome. In addition, a pre-specified blinded histopathology analysis of colon biopsies from the trial indicated dose-dependent high rates of histologic remission which supported the observations of clinical remission and endoscopy responses for PTG-100. During 2018 we replaced PTG-100 with PN-943 as a development candidate for the treatment of IBD based on an assessment of preclinical data from PN-943 suggesting that PN-943 is a more potent compound than PTG-100. 
 We anticipate reporting top-line results of the PN-943 Phase 1 study in the first half of 2019. After having established preliminary clinical efficacy with PTG-100 in UC patients, the PN-943 Phase 1 study is designed to evaluate potency and target engagement of PN-943 in comparison to the historical Phase 1 data with PTG-100. If this study is successful, we anticipate filing an IND in the second half of 2019 in preparation for initiating a Phase 2 proof-of-concept (“POC”) study in UC in the first half of 2020. 
 Our clinical development programs are all derived from our proprietary discovery platform. Our platform enables us to engineer novel, structurally constrained peptides that retain key advantages of both oral small molecules and injectable antibody drugs, while overcoming many of their limitations as therapeutic agents. Importantly, constrained peptides can be designed to alleviate the fundamental instability inherent in traditional peptides to allow different delivery forms, such as oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, and rectal.

 In addition, we continue to use our peptide technology platform to discover product candidates against targets in disease areas with significant unmet medical needs.
 Our Product Candidates 
     PTG-300
     PTG-300 is an injectable hepcidin mimetic. Hepcidin is a natural hormone that regulates iron metabolism. We are developing PTG-300 for the treatment of patients with beta-thalassemia by targeting the chronic anemia that arises from insufficient production and decreased survival of red blood cells known as ineffective erythropoiesis. In diseases of ineffective erythropoiesis, excessive quantities of iron in the bone marrow contribute to oxidative stress and premature cell death causing anemia. In healthy individuals, hepcidin regulates iron levels by inhibiting iron absorption from the GI tract and by limiting macrophage release of iron in the bone marrow. Individuals with beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) can have insufficient hepcidin to maintain appropriate iron levels that result in chronic anemia. Because of stability issues, complexity of synthesis and solubility limitations, direct replacement with native hepcidin is not a practical therapeutic approach. We developed PTG-300 as a stable, soluble, more readily manufactured injectable hepcidin mimetic that could potentially prevent iron toxicity and anemia with chronic sub-cutaneous injections. 
 We completed a Phase 1 single ascending and repeat dose clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers during the fourth quarter of 2017. In the study, PTG-300 produced dose-dependent increases in blood exposure and was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. The most common adverse event was a transient and self-limited erythema (redness) at the injection site in some subjects which was largely dose-related and absent of pain.   The Phase 1 study demonstrated that PTG-300 induced dose-related reductions in serum iron, which persisted beyond 72 hours at higher dose levels. 
     PTG-300 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and EU regulatory authorities, and Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of beta-thalassemia. Fast Track designation is an expedited review to facilitate development of investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition and fill an unmet medical need. In 2018, we successfully filed an IND in the United States and related clinical trial applications outside the United States and initiated enrollment in a global Phase 2 single-arm open label study of PTG-300 in patients with beta-thalassemia. 
     In the first quarter of 2019, we began dosing patients in the Phase 2 study in beta-thalassemia. The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of PTG-300 and identify an appropriate starting dose and titration regimen for registration studies. 
     We plan to initiate an additional Phase 2 study in a second indication in the second half of 2019. 
     PTG-200 
     PTG-200 is a potential first-in-class GI-restricted IL‑23R specific antagonist peptide product candidate for the treatment of IBD. Interleukin‑23 (“IL-23”), a member of the IL‑12 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is a protein that regulates inflammatory and immune function and plays a key role in the development of IBD. By blocking the IL‑23 receptor with PTG‑200 in the GI tissue compartment, we hope to improve disease symptoms and reduce bowel wall damage while potentially minimizing the risk of systemic side effects due to its GI-restricted nature. The IL-23 pathway is targeted by the dual IL-12 and IL‑23 antagonist antibody ustekinumab, administered as an infusion and marketed as Stelara‑®, for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and moderate-to-severe CD.
 We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers in the fourth quarter of 2018. This Phase 1 study, conducted in Australia, was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose-escalation trial in eighty healthy volunteers. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included the identification of the maximally tolerated dose and the evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters.

 We have a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen to co-develop and co-detail PTG-200 for all indications as described in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Together with Janssen, we currently plan to develop PTG-200 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CD, potentially followed by UC. We  continue to provide compound supply services and expect Janssen to file an IND during the first half of 2019 to support a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with Crohn’s disease.
 PTG-100

    PTG-100 is our first generation α4β7 inhibitor that shares the same α4β7 integrin target as the injectable antibody drug vedolizumab, marketed as Entyvio®, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and CD. We completed extensive pre-clinical studies of PTG-100 in which we established pharmacological POC, and completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Australia in 2016. We initiated a global Phase 2 study of PTG-100 in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. In March 2018, we announced the discontinuation of the Phase 2 clinical trial due to futility following a planned interim analysis by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. The interim data revealed an unusually high placebo rate of clinical remission that led to a futility decision and discontinuation of the trial. A human error in the initial endoscopy reads by the original vendor led to the original futile outcome. In August 2018, we announced that an independent, blinded re-read of endoscopies from the study had demonstrated signals of clinical efficacy. In addition, a pre-specified blinded histopathology analysis of colon biopsies from the trial indicated dose-dependent high rates of histologic remission which supported the observations of clinical remission and endoscopy responses for PTG-100. 
 PN-943
     PN-943 has the potential to be a first-in-class oral, α4β7 antagonist for the treatment of IBD. Based on preclinical data, we believe that PN-943 may be a more potent α4β7 integrin antagonist compound than PTG-100 without sacrificing its other positive attributes, such as selectivity and tolerability. The α4β7 integrin is one of the most GI-specific biological targets for IBD. It is a cell surface protein present on T cells that plays an important role in the trafficking of T cells to the GI tissue compartment by binding to MAdCAM‑1, an extracellular protein that resides mostly in the GI vasculature.
     We are leveraging several factors to inform and guide the clinical development of PN-943 for the treatment of IBD. First, PN-943 (as with PTG-100) shares the same α4β7 integrin target as the injectable antibody drug vedolizumab, marketed as Entyvio®, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and CD. Second, we have completed extensive pre-clinical studies of PN-943 in which we established pharmacodynamic target engagement POC, including effects on receptor occupancy, T cell trafficking and mucosal healing in rodents and/or monkeys. Based on preclinical data, we believe that PN-943 may be a more potent α4β7 integrin antagonist compound than PTG-100 without sacrificing its other positive attributes, such as selectivity and tolerability. Third, we are utilizing pharmacodynamic (“PD”) biomarker assays similar to those used with PTG-100 and described in scientific publications with Entyvio® and other antibodies as indicators of target engagement to evaluate POC in our Phase 1 clinical trial with PN-943. These PD data include assessment of receptor occupancy and receptor expression as observed with PTG-100 in a previous Phase 1 healthy volunteer study. We believe that we can leverage the development and regulatory path of Entyvio® and other approved antibody drugs for IBD to help inform the design of our clinical development studies. Finally, we demonstrated that our first generation α4β7 integrin antagonist peptide compound PTG-100 was safe and well-tolerated and showed evidence of clinical activity in the Phase 2 study in UC patients (n=83), which can inform the clinical development of PN-943. 
 We initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) clinical trial of PN-943 in Australia to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (“PK”), and PD-based POC in healthy subjects. We expect to announce results from the Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half of 2019.  
 Additional Product Candidates
 We are currently researching potential oral and injectable peptide-based product candidates for a range of conditions including, but not restricted to, hematology and GI diseases.

 Our IBD Solution: Oral, GI-Restricted Peptides as Targeted Therapies
 For the IBD targets of interest, the size and nature of our peptides are carefully selected and modified so as to acquire the desired potency and specificity, and also to restrict their presence to the GI tissue compartment when administered orally. These features translate to oral, GI-restricted, selective and potent peptide drug candidates with specific advantages compared to antibody drugs:
· | Oral administration. We are developing our peptide therapeutics in a convenient capsule or tablet form intended for oral administration. We believe oral administration may reduce many of the problems and limitations associated with injections or infusions, including injection site pain and local reactions, inconvenience, anxiety, high rates of immunogenicity and potential safety risks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potential for improved safety and tolerability compared to antibody drugs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Oral and GI-restricted delivery minimizes systemic exposure in the blood. Oral GI-restricted delivery results in lower drug levels in the blood that may provide the potential for an enhanced safety profile over antibody drugs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Peptides can be cleared more quickly from systemic circulation. Small molecules and peptides below a size threshold can be rapidly cleared from blood circulation by kidney filtration and excretion. Rapid clearance may be beneficial especially if patients need to discontinue therapy. In contrast, antibody drugs, because of their long plasma half-life, may take months to clear from blood circulation leaving patients exposed to continued or increased safety risk.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The likelihood of much lower immunogenicity of small stable peptides compared to antibody drugs reduces the risk of loss of response. We believe that anti-drug antibodies are less likely to be elicited against constrained peptides, due to their small size, lack of epitope density, resistance to proteolysis, oral tolerance, and minimal systemic absorption.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potential for localized delivery to site of disease. We believe oral dosing of GI-restricted peptides results in substantially higher drug concentrations in the diseased GI tissue compartment compared to injectable antibody drugs. This targeted delivery to the site of action may lead to more immediate and significant target engagement at the site of active disease in the GI tissue compartment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cost-effective and less complex manufacturing. Because of their size and stability, we believe that our oral, GI-restricted peptide product candidates can be produced, stored and shipped in a more cost-effective manner than many antibody drugs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In chronic GI diseases such as IBD, we believe that our oral, GI-restricted peptide product candidates may offer improved delivery, the potential for improved safety and tolerability, and cost efficiencies that may provide an overall benefit to patients, payors, and physicians.
 PTG‑300: AN INJECTABLE HEPCIDIN MIMETIC
     PTG-300 was discovered through our peptide technology platform and is being developed as a novel injectable mimetic of the hormone hepcidin to potentially treat chronic anemia due to ineffective erythropoiesis in certain rare blood disorders with an initial focus on beta-thalassemia. In these diseases, excessive quantities of iron in the bone marrow inhibit the production and decrease the survival of red blood cells, causing anemia. In healthy individuals, hepcidin regulates iron levels in the serum and the bone marrow. Because of stability issues, complexity of synthesis and solubility limitations, direct hepcidin replacement is not a practical therapeutic approach. We designed PTG-300 as a stable, soluble, manufacturable hepcidin mimetic that can treat anemia with weekly or less frequent subcutaneous delivery.

 
  5

 

 Mechanism of Action and Rationale
     The molecular target of the hormone hepcidin is the cellular trans-membrane protein ferroportin, which functions as an export channel for intracellular iron in macrophages, liver hepatocytes, and duodenal enterocytes. By binding to the extracellular domain of ferroportin, hepcidin prevents uptake of iron from the duodenal enterocytes and redistributes iron by reducing the export of iron from inside the cells to the systemic circulation. Excessive quantities of iron relative to the lower levels of beta-globin chains in the bone marrow induce ineffective erythropoiesis resulting in anemia. As a hepcidin mimetic, PTG-300 may redistribute iron to the bone marrow macrophages, reduce iron-induced oxidative stress in the bone marrow, and allow for sufficient production of red blood cells. In addition, by limiting the release of iron into the blood, PTG-300 may inhibit the damage caused by excessive absorption of iron by vital organs such as the liver and heart (i.e. secondary iron overload). 
 Overview of Beta-Thalassemia and Current Therapies 
 We anticipate our initial clinical indication for PTG-300 will be the treatment of chronic anemia in beta-thalassemia. As a result of the underlying genetic defect in -globin production, beta-thalassemia patients may be severely anemic resulting in the need for lifelong supportive care with regular red blood cell transfusions. Repeated transfusions can cause secondary iron overload in the heart and liver which results in shortened lifespan in patients. In the bone marrow, elevated levels of iron can prevent red blood cells from fully developing, resulting in anemia. In addition, the resulting immature red blood cells can aggregate in the spleen causing organ enlargement that may require surgical removal. In conditions of ineffective erythropoiesis, such as beta-thalassemia and MDS, hepcidin levels are suppressed leading to increases in iron absorption from the GI tract and iron export from macrophages which may be toxic to developing erythrocytes. It has been proposed that agents with hepcidin activity may help correct the iron distribution abnormalities in thalassemia with beneficial effects on erythropoiesis.
 Existing treatment options for iron-loading anemia and secondary iron overload are limited. Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (“TDT”) require lifelong regular red blood cell transfusions and general supportive care. Red blood cell transfusions can treat a patient’s anemia but exacerbate the patient’s iron overload and are burdensome. The iron overload caused by transfusions may require treatment with chelating agents, which can have adverse effects. Transfusion and iron chelation therapy have significantly improved the survival of TDT patients over the last few decades. However, these agents work very slowly and have significant kidney and liver toxicity issues. We believe that PTG-300 may be able to restore iron homeostasis in the bone marrow as well as reduce excess circulating iron, improving anemia and thereby reducing or eliminating the need for red blood cell transfusions and related chelation treatments.
 Beta-thalassemia is most prevalent in people of Mediterranean descent, such as Italians, Greeks and Turks, and is also found in people from the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Africa, Southeast Asia and southern China. Globally, the prevalence of beta-thalassemia was estimated to be approximately 300,000 patients in 2008 according to the Centers for Disease Control. The disease is rarer in the United States where Decision Resources Group (“DRG”) estimates there are approximately 3,000 patients. In the major markets of the United States, Italy, Germany, UK, Spain, and France, DRG estimates there are approximately 16,000 diagnosed patients. Most patients with beta-thalassemia suffer from anemia caused by hepcidin deficiency and a significant number are dependent on transfusions and chelating agents, which can cost between $50,000 to $70,000 per year in the United States.
 PTG-300’s Pre-clinical Proof-of-Concept Studies
     In pre-clinical studies, we demonstrated that PTG-300 can lower serum iron more effectively than native hepcidin and maintain reduced serum iron levels for at least 24 hours following a single subcutaneous injection (Figure 2). We have also demonstrated that PTG-300 in a dose dependent manner can reduce serum iron in healthy mice, rats, and cyno, thus establishing pre-clinical POC.

 Figure 2: Significant Difference Between PTG-300 and Synthetic Hepcidin in Lowering Serum Iron in Healthy Mice

     PTG‑300 was also able to address the underlying anemia in a mouse genetic model of beta-thalassemia, as shown most prominently by the significant increase in red blood cell number (“RBC”) and hemoglobin (“HGB”) with the corresponding decrease in reticulocyte content (Figure 3). Consequently, we also observed a significant reduction in the pathological increases in spleen weight (splenomegaly) by addressing the underlying ineffective erythropoiesis. Furthermore, PTG‑300 was effective in reducing the increase in liver iron content. In contrast the oral iron chelator deferiprone (“DFP”) did not correct the anemia or the splenomegaly.

 PTG-300’s Phase 1 Clinical Trial Overview
     We completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in Australia during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled single ascending- and repeat-dose study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PTG-300 in 62 normal healthy male volunteers. 
     The Phase 1 study demonstrated that PTG-300 induced dose-related reductions in serum iron, which persisted beyond 72 hours at higher dose levels. These results were consistent with known activities of hepcidin and pre-clinical studies of PTG-300. In the study, PTG-300 produced dose-dependent increases in blood exposure, and was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. The most common adverse event was a transient and self-limited erythema (redness) at the injection site in some subjects which was largely dose-related and absent of pain.  The study provided a pharmacodynamic POC and established a range of doses that could be evaluated in the treatment of beta-thalassemia.
     PTG‑300’s Development Program
     In 2018, we successfully filed a U.S. IND as well as ex-U.S. clinical trial applications and initiated enrollment in a global Phase 2 single-arm open label study of PTG-300 in patients with non-transfusion dependent and transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia. The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of PTG-300 and identify an appropriate starting dose and titration regimen for registration studies. 
 In addition to the potential treatment of anemia in rare blood disorders, such as beta-thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, PTG-300 therapy may also have potential benefit in other diseases of iron dysregulation such as hereditary hemochromatosis, polycythemia vera, siderophilic infections, and liver fibrosis and we are evaluating potential development pathways for those indications. 
 OVERVIEW OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
     Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, consisting primarily of UC and CD. In UC, inflammation may be limited to part of the colon or extend through its entirety. UC is primarily characterized by ulceration of the intestinal surface, accompanied by rectal bleeding and frequent, urgent bowel movements. CD occurs anywhere along the GI tract, commonly affecting the small intestine and the proximal large intestine. CD complications may include strictures and fistula, which penetrate all layers of the intestine. UC is usually diagnosed earlier than CD, due to bleeding symptoms. Patients with CD may initially present with abdominal pain, fatigue and anorexia, which can be misdiagnosed. Both diseases’ peak diagnosis years are in young adulthood and are found about equally in both males and females. Management is lifelong and affects school attendance, graduation rates, childbearing and work productivity. IBD prevalence is increasing worldwide and is correlated with the adoption of western diets and lifestyle, as well as genetic factors (5 to 20% of affected patients have a first degree relative with the disease).      Market Overview 
 In 2017, GlobalData estimated that the UC market was approximately $5.4 billion across the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Japan (the “7MM”). By the end of 2025, the UC market in the 7MM is expected to reach $6.9 billion. During the same time period, GlobalData estimated that the CD market will grow from $9.0 billion to $13.8 billion. Greater than 84% of UC product sales are from injectable biologic products, including biosimilars. Conventional small molecule therapies, such as aminosalicylates are not effective in CD, therefore once patients are diagnosed, they are even more likely to be treated with biologics than UC patients. 
     Current Standard of Care in IBD
     In the last five years, treatment of IBD has evolved from a focus on successful symptom management to an emphasis on modifying the underlying disease to achieve long-term remission. New technologies and outcome measures have been developed to improve staging definitions and assessments of treatment benefit. Nonetheless, halting or 

 
  9

 
reversing IBD progression has not yet been achieved with any single agent therapy and attaining and maintaining long-term remission in most patients remains an unmet medical need. Across therapeutic classes, 15 to 25% rates of clinical remission represent the current ceiling in patients with moderate-to-severely active disease.  
 Biosimilar infliximab and other tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitors are the first line standard of care in moderate-to-severe IBD. Anti-TNFs bind to and neutralize a central pro-inflammatory cytokine in the gut via systemic immunosuppression. As a result, they can be associated with infection and malignancy risk. Although the magnitude of these risks is relatively low, they are significant for the young IBD population who must continue on lifelong treatment. In addition, more than 10% of patients treated with anti-TNF agents lose response with each year of treatment. In 2014, a novel anti-trafficking mechanism launched with vedolizumab (Entyvio®), which blocks migration of leukocytes into the gut via α4β7 integrins. This mechanism remains the only true “gut selective” approach in the IBD market today, although formulation technologies can limit systemic exposure from oral agents. Five years post-launch Entyvio® has shown an excellent safety profile, although it requires intravenous administration. Entyvio® was followed by the launch of ustekinumab (Stelara®) in CD in 2016, which blocks inflammation produced through the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, and tofacitinib (Xeljanz®), an oral pan-Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor was recently approved in UC.
 No head-to-head trials comparing the long-term safety and efficacy of the marketed mechanisms of action has been completed, although two are in progress to compare outcomes of anti-integrins and anti-TNFs. The first formal combination trials in IBD were initiated in the last year, adding new mechanisms such as integrin inhibitors or IL-23 inhibitors to anti-TNFs. Most IBD experts now believe that combining treatment classes with additive or synergistic mechanisms of action will be required to attain the disease-modifying effects and lasting remissions documented in other areas of immunology, such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis.
 We believe the development of new, potent and targeted oral therapies for IBD may offer safer and more effective treatment options, alone or in combination, for moderate-to-severe IBD patients. In addition, many clinicians continue to advocate for earlier introduction of targeted therapeutics in mild-to-moderate IBD in order to prevent disease progression and irreversible gastrointestinal damage. Our oral, GI-restricted, peptide drugs PN-943 and PTG-200 work on the same specific validated targets as FDA-approved injectable antibodies and have the potential to offer improved safety and compliance and to minimize the risk of immunogenicity associated with antibodies. Taken together, we believe that our product candidates, if approved, have the potential to be used more broadly, including treatment of mild-to-moderate IBD.
 PTG‑200: AN ORAL IL‑23R ANTAGONIST
     PTG-200 was discovered through our peptide technology platform and is being developed as a potential first-in-class oral, GI-restricted antagonist that binds to the IL‑23R and specifically blocks its interaction with the IL‑23 cytokine. PTG‑200 will be initially studied in patients with moderate-to-severe CD potentially followed by UC and pediatric IBD.
 Mechanism of Action and Rationale
     IL-23 is a member of the IL‑12 family of cytokines with pro-inflammatory and autoimmune properties. Cytokines are cell signaling proteins that are released by cells and affect the behavior of other cells. Binding of the IL‑23 ligand to the IL‑23R receptor leads to an expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the mucosal autocrine cascade that is an important pathway of many inflammatory diseases, including IBD. Furthermore, genetic analyses of IBD patients have implicated IL‑23R mutations as a risk factor associated with susceptibility to IBD. The antagonist infused antibody drug ustekinumab (marketed as ‑Stelara® for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and moderate-to-severe CD) is a p40 antagonist antibody that inhibits both the IL-23 and IL-12 pathways. Next-generation IBD antibody drugs, such as guselkumab, target the p19 subunit of the IL‑23 ligand and are specific to the IL-23 pathway, which is believed to be an important driver of local IBD pathology, while not blockading the IL‑12 pathway. IL‑12 is believed to be important in immune surveillance against the development of infections and malignancies.
 We believe that the oral, GI-restricted nature of PTG-200 may allow PTG‑200 to be a potent inhibitor of the IL‑23 pathway for the treatment of IBD. By targeting IL‑23R with our GI-restricted oral IL‑23R antagonist PTG-200, we 

 
  10

 
believe PTG‑200 may restore proper immune function in the GI tissue compartment where there is active disease while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. Several key cell types that reside in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (“GALT”), including T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and natural killer cells, increase their expression of IL-23R during the progression of IBD. Therefore, the high concentrations of PTG‑200 in GALT will facilitate access and binding to IL‑23R expressed in the same tissue.
 PTG‑200’s Pre-Clinical Proof-of-Concept Studies
     PTG-200 potently inhibited binding of IL‑23 to the IL‑23 receptor in several biochemical (“ELISA”) and cell (transformed and primary) signaling assays in a subnanomolar to low nanomolar concentration range sufficient to inhibit 50% of binding. PTG‑200 exhibited greater than a 50,000‑fold selectivity against other structurally similar receptors (IL-12Rb1 and IL‑6R) thereby potentially reducing the risk of off target interactions. In total, these drug properties provide evidence to characterize PTG-200 as a potential first-in-class orally stable IL‑23R-specific antagonist.
 In PK studies in rats and cyno, PTG-200 was GI-restricted with less than 0.5% oral systemic bioavailability in plasma or urine and principal exposure in the small intestine, colon, and feces. Similar results were observed in cyno.
 We have also completed pre-clinical POC studies in rat 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (“TNBS”) colitis models demonstrating that oral delivery of PTG‑200 and other prototype antagonists significantly improved disease outcomes, such as reducing body weight loss, reducing the increased colon weight/length ratio, and reducing the increased colon macroscopic score which is comprised of assessments of colon adhesions, strictures, ulcers, and wall thickness in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4). Furthermore, PTG-200 was found to reduce the increased histopathology summary score, which is comprised of assessments of mucosal and transmural inflammation, gland loss, and erosion parameters. Finally, PTG-200 was able to reduce the expression of the pro-inflammatory IL‑23 induced cytokines in the colon and the IBD disease biomarker lipocalin (“LCN2”) in the serum and feces.

 Figure 4: PTG‑200 Reduces Pathology in Rat TNBS-Induced Colitis 

 The efficacy of oral PTG-200 seen in this IBD model was comparable to that of a positive control antibody against the rat IL‑23p19 subunit which was injected and therefore present in the systemic blood compartment. This allows us to define the efficacious dose range in rats (approximately 28‑61 mg/kg per day) with potential translation to the efficacious dose in humans. PTG-200’s Pre-Clinical Safety Studies
     In pre-clinical safety and toxicity studies in rats and cyno, PTG-200 was well-tolerated with no adverse events at the highest dose levels tested. 
 Clinical Development Plans 
     In November 2018, we announced the completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial of PTG-200 in 80 normal healthy volunteers. Results of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose escalation study demonstrated that administration of PTG-200 was well-tolerated. No serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were consistent with the gastrointestinal-restricted design of PTG-200. We are developing PTG-200 in collaboration with Janssen. We  continue to provide compound supply services and expect Janssen to file an IND during the first half of 2019 to support a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with Crohn’s disease. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

 PN-943: AN ORAL α4β7 INTEGRIN ANTAGONIST
 PN-943 was discovered through our peptide technology platform and is being developed as a potential first-in-class oral, GI-restricted α4β7 integrin-specific antagonist initially for patients with moderate-to-severe UC. Based on preclinical data, we believe that PN-943 may be a more potent α4β7 integrin antagonist compound than PTG-100 without sacrificing its other positive attributes, such as selectivity and tolerability.
     Mechanism of Action and Rationale
     Integrins, such as α4β7, are transmembrane proteins that regulate cellular movement into extravascular tissue and play an important role in modulating the inflammatory reaction in the gut. The α4β7 integrin is expressed on the surface of T cells, immune cells that help defend against foreign and potentially harmful substances that enter the body. The development of UC is driven by the migration of α4β7 T cells into the GI tissue compartment and their subsequent activation within the GI tissue compartment. The entry of α4β7 T cells into the GI tissue compartment is facilitated by the protein-protein interactions (“PPI”) between the α4β7 integrin and its corresponding ligand, MAdCAM‑1, which is primarily expressed in the GI tissue compartment. Hence, the binding of α4β7 to MAdCAM‑1 can be categorized as a GI-specific interaction and has been identified as an IBD-specific targeted therapeutic approach. By blocking the binding of α4β7 integrin to MAdCAM‑1, PN-943 may prevent T cells from entering the GI tissue compartment, thereby reducing the inflammation that leads to the clinical manifestations and long-term implications of UC.
 α4β7 for IBD is targeted by FDA-approved Entyvio® (vedolizumab), which has demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe UC and CD. Since PN-943 targets the same biological pathway as Entyvio®, we are utilizing similar PD-based POC in our pre-clinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trial to inform and guide our Phase 2 development program. We sourced these PD biomarker assays from public scientific publications and do not maintain any contractual arrangement providing access to this information with the makers of these marketed products.
 Translating PN-943’s Pre-Clinical POC to Clinical POC
     We established a potentially efficacious dose range of PN-943 in mice by demonstrating similar pharmacologic activity between oral PN-943 and the first-generation antagonist, PTG‑100, and an injectable α4β7 antibody in mouse models of IBD. Concurrently, we employed a complementary pharmacodynamics approach for establishing a potentially efficacious human dose range and early POC. This involved specific blood PD response markers that reflect α4β7 integrin target engagement of PN-943 in the GI tissue compartment and then establishing a correlation of those PD measurements with efficacy responses in mouse colitis models. Target engagement is a critical feature for demonstrating that PN-943 can reach its intended target, thus leading to the inhibition of T cell trafficking into the GI tissue compartment. Our PD markers were monitored in mice and cyno and are being similarly evaluated in normal healthy volunteers in our Phase 1 clinical trial. These blood PD responses in pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that PN-943 engaged its intended α4β7 target and combined with PD data from the Phase 1 trial will help guide dosing for our Phase 2 UC trial.
 PN-943’s Pre-Clinical Proof-of-Concept Studies
     Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that PN-943 is a potent and highly selective α4β7 antagonist with minimal systemic absorption. Rodent colitis models have further demonstrated that PN-943 can inhibit T cell trafficking in the gut similar to the actions of the first generation α4β7 antagonist, PTG-100, and the mouse α4β7 antagonist antibody.
 PN-943 potently inhibited binding of α4β7 to MAdCAM‑1 in several human biochemical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (“ELISA”) and cell adhesion (transformed and primary cells) assays in a low nanomolar concentration range sufficient to inhibit 50% of binding (“IC50”) comparable to vedolizumab (Figure 5). PN-943 exhibited greater than a 50,000-fold selectivity against other structurally similar integrins, α4β1 and αLβ2, in cell adhesion assays which is comparable to the selectivity of vedolizumab (Figure 5). PN-943 was stable in in vitro assays simulating the GI tissue compartment, such as the small intestine and gastric stomach, with half-lives exceeding 12 hours and in human liver microsomes suggesting strong oral stability and the potential for once daily dosing in humans. PN-943 did not affect the growth of and was not metabolized by common members of the human intestinal microflora. In 

 
  13

 
total, these drug properties provide evidence to characterize PN-943 as a potential first-in-class orally stable α4β7‑specific antagonist. Furthermore, these drug properties allowed us to demonstrate POC in animal colitis studies.
 Figure 5: PN-943: More Potent Than PTG-100 

 Non-clinical metabolism and PK studies demonstrated that much greater amounts of PN-943 as measured by the maximum concentration (“Cmax”) as a percentage of total drug amount dosed orally, were present in the GI compartments, such as the small intestine, colon and feces compared to the systemic plasma and urine compartments of mice, rats and cyno, thus confirming its GI-restricted properties. Further, PN-943 has an oral systemic bioavailability of less than 0.5%.
 We designed rodent colitis studies similar to those used for antibody drugs targeting this pathway to specifically monitor pre-clinical blood PD responses to PTG-100 and PN-943, specifically receptor occupancy (“RO”) increases reflecting target engagement (Figure 6) and receptor expression (“RE”) decreases reflecting subsequent pharmacologic activity. In addition, we measured increases in T cell numbers in the blood as a surrogate of T cell trafficking to and from the GI tissue compartment as affected by PTG-100 and PN-943 treatments (Figure 6). Under inflammatory conditions in the GI tissue compartment PN-943 showed similar responses to PTG-100 at 3-fold lower dose. Further treatment benefit was demonstrated through analysis for colon and mucosal damage which are characteristics of UC in humans.

     Establishing Blood Pharmacodynamic Readouts of Target Engagement
     We have used pre-clinical blood PD response markers that reflect target engagement in the GI tissue compartment and correlate with efficacy responses in mouse colitis studies to guide our dosing in human studies. Furthermore, we believe these pre-clinical blood PD responses, specifically receptor occupancy (“RO”) increases reflecting target engagement and receptor expression (“RE”) decreases reflecting subsequent pharmacologic activity, can be compared to the PD responses we observed in our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and ultimately can help to guide the dosing for evaluating clinical benefit in UC patients in the Phase 2 clinical trial. In the mouse colitis model, RO and RE were correlated with in vivo efficacy that can be extrapolated to the blood RO and RE observed in healthy mice and cyno. These PD markers from mice and cyno have specifically demonstrated increases in RO that peak at approximately 4 hours following a single dose and multiple doses and decreases in RE after multiple doses in healthy mice and colitis mice. In translating the pre-clinical observations into a clinical setting, we will focus on evaluating dose- and time-dependent trends in RO and RE in our Phase 1 clinical trial that can be benchmarked to the animal data to give us greater confidence in progressing PN-943 in clinical trials. Emphasis is placed on trends and not on absolute numbers owing to differences in GI transit times in different species and absence of absolute scaling methods from animals to humans for GI-restricted drugs.
 PN-943’s Non-GLP and GLP Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies
     To date, all toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have not identified any safety issues. Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) toxicology studies in rats and cyno over 28 days of dosing showed that PN-943 was well-tolerated at all dose levels with no dose-limiting toxicities. No adverse effects were seen in either rat or cyno studies at all doses tested. Standard safety pharmacology and genotoxicity studies were similarly negative. We are initiating 12 week GLP toxicology studies to support our anticipated Phase 2 program.
 PN-943’s Phase 1 Clinical Trial Overview
     Following the submission and approval of a Clinical Trial Notification (“CTN”), we initiated a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of PN-943 in normal healthy male volunteers in Australia. 

 
  15

 
The Phase 1 SAD and MAD components are being conducted with a solution-based liquid formulation. In addition to determining the safety and tolerability and PK of PN-943, the SAD and MAD components of the trial will evaluate PD-based POC through the assessment of α4β7 receptor occupancy and α4β7 target expression that indicate target engagement on peripheral blood memory T cells similar to what was done in the pre-clinical studies and in the Phase 1 trial with PTG-100. In both the SAD and MAD portions of the clinical trial, dose escalation will proceed from 100 mg up to the planned 1,400 mg dose level.
 OUR PEPTIDE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM
     Our proprietary technology platform has been successfully applied to a diverse set of biological targets that has led to several pre-clinical and clinical-stage peptide-based new chemical entities, including our clinical-stage product candidates, for a variety of clinical indications. Our platform is comprised of a series of tools and methods, including a combination of molecular design, phage display, oral stability, medicinal chemistry, and in vivo pharmacology approaches.
 The platform is used to develop potential drug candidates: (i) using the structure of a target, when available, (ii) when no target structure exists, or (iii) from publicly disclosed peptide starting points. In a structure-based approach, our proprietary molecular design software and structural database of several thousand constrained peptides, termed Vectrix™, are screened to identify suitable scaffolds which form the basis of designing and constructing the first set of phage or chemical libraries. The initial hits are identified by either panning or screening such libraries, respectively. When structural information is unavailable for a target, hits are identified by panning a set of 34 proprietary cluster-based phage libraries consisting of millions of constrained peptides. Once the hits are identified, they are optimized using a set of peptide, peptide mimetic and medicinal chemistry techniques that include the incorporation of new or manipulation of existing cyclization-constraints, as well as natural or unnatural amino acids and chemical conjugation or acylation techniques. These techniques are applied to optimize potency, selectivity, stability, exposure and ultimately efficacy. For oral stability, a series of in vitro and ex vivo oral-stability assays that portray the chemical and metabolic barriers a peptide will encounter as it transits the GI tract are used to identify metabolically labile spots in the peptides. Such sites form the focus of medicinal-chemistry based optimization to engineer oral stability. Finally, various in vivo pharmacology tools are then used to quantify peptide exposure in relevant GI organs and tissues. The data can then be used to optimize required GI exposure and ultimately in vivo efficacy.
 The key foundations of the platform include:
 Molecular design tools and large database of constrained scaffolds
     Through advances in genomics, molecular biology and structural genomic initiatives there has been an explosion in the number of known structures of potential new drug targets, including PPI targets. In particular, constrained peptides have the required surface complexity to match or complement the large flat surfaces of PPI targets to provide potent and selective drug candidates. We believe existing commercial molecular design software is not suitable, as it has been developed to identify small molecules that plug cavities of enzymes and do not bind to PPI targets.
 We have developed a database of all known structures of a sub-class of constrained peptides, known as disulfide-rich peptides (“DRPs”). We have collected approximately 4,500 DRP scaffolds that are found throughout nature, ranging from single cell organisms to humans. We have created a proprietary molecular design environment, called Vectrix™. A pattern matching algorithm within Vectrix™ allows the selection of an appropriately stable DRP scaffold using the structure of the target of interest. This molecular design process is used to identify constrained peptides as starting points for hit discovery, which are ultimately optimized into potent, selective peptides against targets which are not amenable to small molecule drug discovery.
 Phage display techniques and cluster libraries
     Phage display may be used to discover the original hit based on Vectrix™-derived scaffolds, optimize existing hits, or to identify hits against those targets in which no structural information exists. For the latter targets, a series of pre-existing phage libraries, termed cluster libraries, are used for hit discovery. This includes 20 proprietary libraries of 

 
  16

 
structurally diverse DRPs that sample greater than 85% of their known structural diversity and 14 proprietary libraries that sample different protein loop geometries. Collectively these libraries provide immense potential for discovering hits at diverse targets as they are based on natural-DRP scaffolds with these characteristics.
 Oral stability and in vitro and ex vivo assays
     The GI tract provides a set of chemical and metabolic barriers that hinder the development of oral therapeutic agents. We have developed numerous in vitro and ex vivo systems that profile peptide candidates for their stability features needed for oral delivery, GI restriction, and transit through the entire GI tract. This includes profiling for chemical stability, specifically pH and redox stability, and metabolic stability against proteases and other enzymes that are either of human or microbial origin.
 These in vitro assays identify metabolic weak spots of peptides, which can then be stabilized by peptidic and peptidomimetic modifications without losing potency.
 Medicinal peptide chemistry
     We have significant expertise in optimizing potency, selectivity, oral stability and exposure of constrained peptides using a combination of peptide-cyclization, natural and unnatural amino acids, and various conjugation and acylation techniques. With respect to PTG-300, hit discovery and optimization relies exclusively on medicinal chemistry, with no phage display, to develop potent and selective injectable candidates with enhanced exposure in blood. For other targets, such as the discovery of PN-943 and PTG‑200, phage display is tightly coupled to medicinal chemistry and oral stability techniques to develop potent, selective and oral molecules that are GI-restricted.
 In vivo pharmacology tools for GI restriction
     When developing oral, GI-restricted constrained peptides, we correlate efficacy with potency and level of GI tissue compartment exposure. We have developed the required expertise and know-how to build PK and PD relationships to optimize physicochemical features of constrained peptides such that they are minimally absorbed and have the required degree of GI tissue compartment exposure over the required duration of time to achieve efficacy. This involves examining constrained peptide concentrations in various GI tissue compartments, blood, urine, and feces when delivered orally in rodents. In this fashion, we can understand the degree of tissue targeting, GI restriction and oral stability that is required to achieve efficacy.
 Future Applications of our Platform
     We believe we have built a versatile, well-validated and unique discovery platform. For example, this peptide technology platform has been used to develop product candidates for diverse target classes including G-protein-coupled receptors (“GPCRs”), ion channels, transporters and cytokines for a variety of therapeutic areas. In the future we may tackle other GI diseases and expand our delivery techniques to include other organ/tissue systems, such as the lung and eye, which will provide potential opportunities to pursue a variety of diseases. In addition, the gut may communicate with the immune, central nervous, and endocrine systems, providing the potential of our GI-restricted approach to treat metabolic, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Lastly, we intend to progress our platform to achieve systemic bioavailability with peptides, thereby enabling us to address systemic diseases.
 Material Agreements 
     Janssen License and Collaboration Agreement
     In May 2017, we and Janssen entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement (the “Janssen License and Collaboration Agreement”) for the development, manufacture and commercialization of PTG-200 worldwide for the treatment of CD and UC. The Janssen License and Collaboration Agreement became effective on July 13, 2017. Upon the effectiveness of the agreement, we received a non-refundable, upfront cash payment of $50.0 million from Janssen.

 Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Zealand Pharma A/S
     In June 2012, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Zealand Pharma A/S (“Zealand”) to identify, optimize and develop novel DRPs to discover a hepcidin mimetic. We amended this agreement on February 28, 2014, at which point Protagonist assumed responsibility for the development program. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments” and Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
 We believe our principal competition in the treatment of chronic iron overload disorders such as beta-thalassemia will be luspatercept (Acceleron/Celgene-BMS) and La Jolla Pharmaceutical’s LJPC-401, a synthetic human hepcidin.  Although gene therapy is potentially curative for beta-thalassemia, we believe that Bluebird Bio’s LentiGlobin will have limited application due to safety risks associated with its required “pre-conditioning” regimen, which is similar to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is infrequently utilized in beta-thalassemia due to its risk benefit profile in a younger patient population. Luspatercept and LentiGlobin are in Phase 3 development for beta-thalassemia and MDS and LJPC-401 is in Phase 2 studies for beta-thalassemia and hereditary hemochromatosis.
 There are currently no approved oral peptide-based α4β7 or IL‑23R products for IBD. We believe our principal competition in the treatment of IBD will come from companies with injectable agents in the anti-integrin class that are or will be approved by 2028, including:

· | Takeda’s Vedolizumab (Entyvio®) IV and SC (IV approved, SC Phase 3);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Roche’s Etrolizumab SC (Phase 3); and
--+--------------------------------------


· | Shire’s SHP-647 SC (Phase 3; divested as part of the Takeda acquisition of Shire - buyer to be determined).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, oral agents with novel mechanisms of action are approved or in development, and may be approved for UC and/or CD prior to the launch of PTG-200 and PN-943. These include JAK inhibitors, pan-JAK tofacitinib (Xeljanz) recently approved in UC and next-generation JAK1 inhibitors filgotinib and upadacitinib, as well as S1P inhibitors, ozanimod and etrasimod. The anti-IL-23 antibodies are also demonstrating positive data in IBD. Our product, PTG-200, will compete as the only oral IL-23 receptor antagonist.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of peptide-based therapeutics that may be important for the development of our business. We will also take advantage of regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.

 
  18

 

 Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. For more information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 We have eleven issued patents and numerous patent applications related to our clinical-stage product candidates and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of peptide based therapeutic products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, peptide-based therapeutic compositions, methods of using these peptide-based therapeutic compositions to treat or prevent disease, methods of manufacturing peptide-based therapeutic compositions, and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates. Specifically, our patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of α4β7 integrin peptides, IL-23R antagonist peptides, and hepcidin and enkephalin mimetics peptides, as well as methods of synthesizing and using these peptides to treat inflammatory disorders. Applications are currently pending in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and Europe. We expect our patents and patent applications, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from October 2033 to February 2039 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
 Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our product candidates and related peptide-based drug technologies.
 We also license patents and patent applications directed to processes and methods related to our technology platform. These patents have issued in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia and Europe and are expected to expire between September 2019 and February 2023. Material aspects of our technology platform are protected by trade secrets and confidentiality agreements.
 In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of pre-clinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.

 Trade Secrets
 We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, particularly in relation to our technology platform. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” Manufacturing 
     We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of all of our product candidates for pre-clinical, clinical studies and eventually for commercial supplies, and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organization (“CMOs”) eliminates the need for us to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing and quality control experience overseeing CMOs. We regularly consider second source or back-up manufacturers for both active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for the product candidates. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing needed quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands, but we have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical materials to date. We currently engage CMOs on a “fee for services” basis based on our current development plans. We plan to identify CMOs and enter into longer term contracts or commitments as we move our product candidates into Phase 3 clinical trials. We believe there are alternate sources of manufacturing that have been and could be engaged and enabled to satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, however we cannot guarantee that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources will be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of our product candidates.
 Government Regulation        The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
 U.S. Government Regulation
     In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.

 
  20

 

 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

  Pre-clinical Studies
     Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical Trials
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND (or equivalent submission ex-US). In addition, an IRB or ethics committee (“EC”) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.

 
  21

 

 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.

· | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing Approval
     Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (“PREA”), as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.

 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Orphan Designation
     The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”). After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.

 Post-Approval Requirements
     Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
     Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of such products will be covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services by challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-

 
  24

 
party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process can be a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for health care providers or less profitable than alternative treatments, or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use.
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and expanded the rebate program to include Medicaid managed care organizations. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against health care fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the current administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, the President has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA were signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, the President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further , the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”, and increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in the Medicare Part D program. There may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. The ACA is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations 

 
  25

 
period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding.
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the current administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current administration have both stated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
 Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements
     We will also be subject to health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business once our products are approved. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; the criminal health care fraud statutes under HIPAA also prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; the federal health care programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws that prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid; and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not 

 
  26

 
preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to health care providers and entities.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 Government Regulation Outside of the United States
     In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 The requirements for conducting clinical trials in Australia, where we conduct Phase 1 trials for our product candidates, are as follows:
 Conducting clinical trials for therapeutic drug candidates in Australia is subject to regulation by Australian governmental entities. Approval for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (“ARTG”) is required before a pharmaceutical drug product may be marketed in Australia.
 Typically, the process of obtaining approval of a new therapeutic drug product for inclusion in the ARTG requires compilation of clinical trial data. Clinical trials conducted using “unapproved therapeutic goods” in Australia, being those which have not yet been evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) for quality, safety and efficacy must occur pursuant to either the CTN or Clinical Trial Exemption (“CTX”), process.
 The CTN process broadly involves:

· | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to a Human Research Ethics Committee (“HREC”) of all material relating to the proposed clinical trial, including the trial protocol. The TGA does not review any data relating to the clinical trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | final approval for the conduct of the clinical trial by the institution or organization at which the clinical trial will be conducted (“Approving Authority”), having due regard to the advice from the HREC; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | notification of the clinical trial to the TGA.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
 
  27

 

 The CTX process broadly involves:

· | submission of an application to conduct a clinical trial to the TGA for evaluation and comment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a sponsor cannot commence a CTX trial until written advice has been received from the TGA regarding the application and approval for the conduct of the trial has been obtained from an ethics committee and the institution at which the trial will be conducted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | receipt of written advice from the TGA regarding the application; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | receipt of approval for the conduct of the trial from an ethics committee and the institution at which the trial will be conducted.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In each case, it is required that:

· | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the therapeutic product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | evidence is compiled which demonstrates that the manufacture of the therapeutic drug product complies with the principles of cGMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | manufacturing and clinical data is derived to submit to the Australian Committee on Prescription Medicines, which makes recommendations to the TGA as to whether or not to grant approval to include the therapeutic drug product in the ARTG; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an ultimate decision is made by the TGA whether to include the therapeutic drug product in the ARTG.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the therapeutic drug product as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The results of the pre-clinical studies form part of the materials submitted to the HREC in the case of a CTN trial and part of the application to the TGA in the case of a CTX trial.
 Clinical trials involve administering the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. The TGA has developed guidelines for a CTN. Under the CTN process, all material relating to the proposed trial is submitted directly to the HREC of each institution at which the trial is to be conducted. An HREC is an independent review committee set up under guidelines of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. The role of an HREC is to ensure the protection of rights, safety and wellbeing of human subjects involved in a clinical trial by, among other things, reviewing, approving and providing continuing review of trial protocols and amendments, and of the methods and material to be used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects. The TGA is formally notified by submission of a CTN application but does not review the safety of the drug or any aspect of the proposed clinical trial. The approving authority of each institution gives the final approval for the conduct of the clinical trial, having due regard to advice from the HREC. Following approval, responsibility for all aspects of the trial conducted under a CTN application remains with the HREC of each investigator’s institution.
 The standards for clinical research in Australia are set by the TGA and the National Health and Medical Research Council, and compliance with GCP is mandatory. Guidelines, such as those promulgated by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”), are required across all fields, including those related to pharmaceutical quality, nonclinical and clinical data requirements and study designs. The basic requirements for preclinical data to support a first-in-human study under ICH guidelines are applicable in Australia. Requirements related to adverse event reporting in Australia are similar to those required in other major jurisdictions.
