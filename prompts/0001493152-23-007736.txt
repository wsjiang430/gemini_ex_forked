ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Founded in 2012, we are a vertically integrated provider of Space-as-a-Service solutions including end-to-end satellite support. The company combines mission critical hardware manufacturing; multi-disciplinary engineering services; satellite design, manufacture, launch planning, mission operations and in-orbit support; and space-based data collection with a vision to enable space flight heritage status for new technologies and deliver data and predictive analytics to both domestic and global customers. We have over ten (10) years of commercial, military and government manufacturing experience combined with space qualification experience, existing customers and pipeline, and International Space Station (ISS) heritage hardware.
 
In addition, we are building a multi-mission satellite constellation using our hybrid 3D printed multipurpose satellite to provide continuous, near real-time Earth Observation and Internet-of-Things (IOT) data for the global space economy. We have designed and are manufacturing LizzieSat (LS) for our LEO satellite constellation operating in diverse orbits (28°-98° inclination, 300-650km altitude) as approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in February 2021. LS is expected to begin operations in 2023. Initial launches are planned via NASA CRS2 program agreement and launch service rideshare contracts. Each LS is 100kg with 35kg dedicated to payloads including remote sensing instruments. Payloads (Sidus or customer owned) can collect data over multiple Earth based locations, record it onboard, and downlink via ground passes to Sidus Mission Control Center (MCC) in Merritt Island, FL.

Leveraging our existing manufacturing operations, flight hardware manufacturing experience and commercial off the shelf subsystem hardware, we believe we can deliver customer sensors to orbit in months, rather than years. In addition, we intend on delivering high-impact data for insights on aviation, maritime, weather, space services, earth intelligence and observation, financial technology (Fintech) and the Internet of Things. While our business has historically been centered on the design and manufacture of space hardware, our expansion into manufacture of spacecraft as well as on-orbit constellation management services and space data applications has led us to innovating in the area of space data applications. We continue to patent our products including our satellites, external platforms and other innovations. Sidus offerings include a broad area of market sub-segments, such as:
 

● | Mission Critical Hardware Manufacturing 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Multi-Disciplinary Engineering Services 
● | Satellite Design, Production, Launch Planning, Mission Operations, and In-Orbit Support 
● | On-Orbit Testing of Space Ecosystem Technologies and Hardware 
● | Data and Analytics Derived from Satellite Missions 

 
Each of these areas and initiatives addresses a critical component of our cradle-to-grave solution and value proposition for the space economy as a Space-as-a-Service company. The majority of our revenues to date have been from our space related hardware manufacturing, however, 2022 revenue includes revenue related to our multi-mission constellation and our hybrid 3D printed LizzieSat satellite.
 
We support a broad range of international and domestic government and commercial companies with its hardware manufacturing including the Department of State, the Department of Defense, NASA, Collins Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Teledyne Marine, Bechtel, and L3Harris in areas that include launch vehicles, satellite hardware, and autonomous underwater vehicles. Planned services that benefit not only current customers but additional such as Mission Helios include providing the ability for customers to demonstrate that a technology (hardware or software) performs successfully in the harsh environment of space and delivering space-based data that can provide critical insight for agriculture, commodities tracking, disaster assessment, illegal trafficking monitoring, energy, mining, oil and gas, fire monitoring, classification of vegetation, soil moisture, carbon mass, Maritime AIS, Aviation ADS, weather monitoring, and space services. We plan to own and operate one of the industry’s leading U.S. based low earth orbit (“LEO”) small satellite (“smallsat” or “smallsats”) constellations. Our operating strategy is to continue to enhance the capabilities of our satellite constellation, to increase our international and domestic partnerships and to expand our analytics offerings in order to increase the value we deliver to our customers. Our two operating assets—our satellite constellation and hardware manufacturing capability—are mutually reinforcing and are a result of years of heritage and innovation.
 
Our strategy is to capitalize on the rapid growth and deployment of millions of low-cost GPS enabled terrestrial, IoT, and space-based sensors to provide data to global customers in near real-time. As we are now entering a new commercial space age, the number of commercial sensors on orbit has expanded from a handful of large expensive commercial satellites just a few years ago to now hundreds and in the near future thousands of sensors that will ultimately change the way we see and understand our world. Our mission is to enable our existing and future customers to prove out new technologies for the space ecosystem rapidly and at low cost and also have access to space-based data on-demand for any problem set or business need. We believe we can deliver this at a lower cost than legacy providers due to our vertically integrated cost-efficiencies, capital efficient constellation design, and improved pricing models with improved data accessibility. We believe the combination of the proven flight heritage and years of industry experience of a traditional space company with the disruptive innovation of a new space startup such as our 3D printing of spacecraft and focus on intellectual property makes us very well positioned in the global space economy.

Key Factors Affecting Our Results and Prospects
 
We believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities but also pose risks and challenges, including competition from better known and well-capitalized companies, the risk of actual or perceived safety issues and their consequences for our reputation and the other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.” We believe the factors discussed below are key to our success.
 
Growing our experienced space hardware operations
 
We are on track to grow our space and defense hardware operations, with a goal of expanding to two and a half shifts with an increased customer base in the future. With current customers in space, marine, and defense industries, our contract revenue is growing, and we are in active discussions with numerous potential customers, including government agencies, large defense contractors and private companies, to add to our contracted revenue. In the past decade, we have fabricated ground and flight products for the NASA SLS Rocket and Mobile Launcher as well as other commercial space and satellite companies. Customers supported include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Dynetics/Leidos, Blue Origin, United Launch Alliance, Collins Aerospace, L3Harris, OneWeb and Space Systems Loral/Maxar. Various products have been manufactured including fluid, hydraulic and pneumatic systems, electrical control systems, cable harnesses, hardware lifting frames, umbilical plates, purge and hazardous gas disconnects, frangible bolts, reef cutters, wave guides, customized platforms, and other precision machined and electrical component parts for all types of Rockets, Ground, Flight and Satellite systems. In June 2022, the NASA xEVAS, 12 year, $3.5 Billion multiple award contract was awarded to Collins Aerospace and Axiom Space. We are a member of the Collins Aerospace team and expect to support this contract upon execution of task orders issued by NASA and contracts with independent commercial entities. The Exploration Extravehicular Activity Services, or xEVAS Program is expected to include the design, development, production, hardware processing, and sustainment of an integrated Extravehicular Activity (EVA) capability that includes a new Spacesuit and ancillary hardware, such as Vehicle Interface Equipment and EVA tools. This EVA capability is to be provided as a service for the NASA International Space Station (ISS), Artemis Program (Gateway and Human Landing System), and Commercial Space missions.
 
Commencing and Expanding Commercial Satellite Operations
 
Our goal is to help customers understand how space-based data can be impactful to day-to-day business. Our strategy includes increasing the demand downstream by starting out as end user focused. While others are focused on data verticalization strategy specializing on a key sectors or problem set, we believe that flexibility in production, low-cost bespoke design and ‘Bringing Space Down to Earth’ for consumers will provide a scalable model for growth. Critical Design Review (CDR) was successfully completed in the third fiscal quarter of 2022. Initial contracts for launch were signed in December of 2021 with NASA and Mission Helios, a blockchain company. We are in active discussions with numerous potential customers, including domestic and international government agencies, for payload hosting and data related to our planned satellite launches over the next 24 months.
 
We filed for X-band and S-band radio frequencies licensing in February 2021 and were granted approval through a published filing by the ITU on April 4, 2021. Such licenses are held through Aurea Alas, Ltd., an Isle of Man company, which is a variable interest entity (“VIE”)to us. Our filing contains approved spectrum use for multiple X-Band and S-Band frequencies and five different orbital planes. Additionally, we filed and received approval for a NOAA license related to our initial launch. Any delays in commencing our commercial launch operations, including due to delays or cost overruns in obtaining NOAA licenses or other regulatory approvals for future operations or frequency requirements, could adversely impact our results and growth plans.
 
Our Vertically Integrated Space Platform
 
We are designing, developing, manufacturing, and plan to operate a constellation of proprietary smallsats. These satellites are designed to for multiple missions and customers and form the foundation of our satellite platform. Weighing approximately 100 kilograms each, these hybrid 3D printed, modular satellites are more functional than cubesats and nanosatellites and less expensive to manufacture than the larger satellites in the 200-600kg range. Launched into a LEO and operating in diverse orbits (28°-98° inclination, 300-650km altitude) as approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in February 2021, our constellation will be optimally distributed to provide maximum coverage for our customers in the government and commercial sectors. With six initial globally distributed ground stations, our constellation is designed for rapid tasking, collection, and delivery of high-revisit, high-resolution imagery and data analytics. Our planned average daily revisit rate, from dawn to dusk, is 10 times a day or approximately 90 minutes. As our satellite constellation grows, the amount of data we collect will scale, and we expect our revisit rate will improve.

Our cost efficient smallsats are designed from the ground-up to optimize performance per unit cost. We can integrate technologies and deliver data on demand at lower costs than legacy providers due to our vertical integration, use of COTS proven systems, cost-efficiencies, capital efficient constellation design, and adaptable pricing models.
 
We are manufacturing our satellites at our Cape Canaveral facility. Our current configuration and facility is designed to manufacture 5-10 satellites a month. Our vertical integration enables us to control our satellites through the entire design, manufacturing, and operation process. Our years of experience manufacturing space hardware means that we are able to leverage our manufacturing expertise and commercial best practices for satellite production. Additionally, leveraging both in-house and partner-provided subsystem components and in-house design and integration services, as well as operational support of satellites on orbit, to provide turn-key delivery of entire constellations offer “concept to constellation” in months instead of years. Specifically, our Space-as-a-Service offerings encompass all aspects of hosted satellite and constellation services, including hosting customer payloads onto our satellites, and delivering services to customers from our space platform. These services are expected to allow customers to focus on developing innovative payloads rather than having to design or develop complete satellite buses or satellites or constellations, which we will provide, along with ancillary services that are likely to include telemetry, tracking and control (“TT&C”), communications, processing, as well as software development and maintenance. Our patented technologies include a print head for regolith-polymer mixture and associated feedstock; a heat transfer system for regolith; a method for establishing a wastewater bioreactor environment; vertical takeoff and landing pad and interlocking pavers to construct same; and high-load vacuum chamber motion feedthrough systems and methods. Regolith is a blanket of unconsolidated, loose, heterogeneous superficial deposits covering solid rock. It includes dust, broken rocks, and other related materials and is present on Earth, the Moon, Mars, some asteroids, and other terrestrial planets and moons. We continue to patent our products including our satellites, external platforms and other innovations.
 
Revenue Generation
 
We generate revenue by selling payload space on our satellite platform, providing engineering and systems integration services to strategic customers on project-by-project basis, and manufacturing space hardware. This support is typically contracted to both commercial and government customers under fixed price contracts and often includes other services. Additionally, we intend to add to our revenue by selling geospatial data captured through our constellation. Our data monetization strategy includes selling data directly to other companies and consumers, selling data to data aggregation firms, listing our data on a data marketplace and leveraging a white label data commerce platform.
Lowering Manufacturing Cost and Schedule
 
We are developing a manufacturing model that provides for rapid response to customer requirements including integration of customers technologies and space-based data delivery. Our planned satellites are being designed to integrate Customer Off the Shelf (COTS) subsystems that are space-proven, can be rapidly integrated into the satellite and replaced rapidly when customer needs changed or evolve. Our vertically integrated manufacturing processes give us the flexibility to make changes during the production cycle without impacting launch or costs.
 
Our satellite production process is based around normally readily available materials and COTS systems and is highly scalable. We believe that our ongoing innovations in design and manufacturing will further reduce our per satellite costs. We invested approximately $16 million in our business and manufacturing facility through December 31, 2022, and we expect the facility will be at full capacity by the end of 2024. We anticipate that this will enable us to increase the pace of satellite manufacturing and launch cadence. While we believe that our estimate is reliable, the development of our manufacturing facility may take longer than planned, including due to delays in obtaining federal and state regulatory approvals of our final construction plans or any changes that are required to be made to those plans. Any delays in our achieving full manufacturing capacity could adversely impact our results and growth plans.

Environmental, social, and corporate governance
 
We are developing an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) policy that will implement the tracking of several indicators we believe are critical to ensure we are doing our part to continue sustainable growth and maximize shareholder value. We have been in business for ten years manufacturing space hardware and components, and in that time, implementation of policies and processes to mitigate environmental impact have been of upmost importance. Furthermore, since our inception, we have recognized the value of our employees and have always endeavored to prioritize employee well-being. We also understand that our efforts to promote value and well-being are not limited to our employees. We are committed to the communities we belong to and have endeavored to provide tangible benefits back to the community that supports us.
 
Environmental
 
As the global awareness and importance of environmental sustainability increases, we recognize our duty to implement developments that not only facilitate the evolution of aerospace solutions, but also promote environmentally conscious protocols yielding measurable results toward the conservation of our planet. A key component of our focus on sustainability is found in our utilization of in-house 3D printing technology as a primary manufacturing asset. The development of 3D printing is host to a variety of manufacturing improvements but perhaps one of the chief benefits is the reduced environmental Impact of our manufacturing. Our LizzieSat constellation will contribute to this reduced impact as a portion of the satellite bus is 3D printed.
 
Manufacturing parts with a 3D printer reduces overall energy consumption and waste, reducing our carbon footprint compared to its predecessor of conventional machining. Additional benefits include the removal of waste and unnecessary energy associated with conventional machining, often resulting in the production of more scrapped material per part than the material that part is composed of. While these are among the biggest impacts, the effects to can be seen in smaller scales. Due to the massive reduction in weight 3D printing provides, energy spent using cargo ships and commercial vehicles for transportation sees a significant decrease. This reduction in weight is accompanied by a reduction in space requirements for housing the material, cutting out the need for large storage spaces and the energy needed to maintain those facilities.
 
Looking toward the future, the potential for exciting developments in the field of sustainability are of upmost importance. These developments include the planned use of more biodegradable and/or recycled materials that can be used to manufacture parts and further benefit the environment. Until these developments occur, we are doing our part through the practice of recycling of metal and any used oil and coolant. As technologies continue to advance, we remain dedicated to preserving the Earth and continuing to evolve with newer technologies as they develop.
 
Social
 
We recognize the importance of our employees, the community with which we are situated as well as the global community. This recognition has led us to implement a variety of actions that support society from the individual to global scale.
 
Employee well-being is at the heart of our commitment to provide a positive impact on all. We understand the importance of diversity in the workplace because we were built on diversity. Being a service-disabled, veteran-owned, woman-owned, and Hispanic minority-owned business reflects the open and diverse environment we provide to all who are a part of it.


Community on all scales is fundamental to our success, and because of that, we are committed to leaving a lasting impact on the community that supports us. This commitment brought forth Sidus Serves, our way of actively improving life on earth. Community involvement is key to our culture, and we believe in the power of volunteerism. We actively invest in the communities of our employees and are passionate about the improvement of their communities through individual efforts and partnership with local, regional, and national organizations. We also believe it is important to bridge the gap in the aerospace field by supporting young professionals through establishing partnerships with several organizations dedicated to providing STEM learning opportunities to a diverse array of students.

Our Board of Directors consists of professionals with strong executive experience, business strategy and leadership skills. Our board consists of 3 independent directors alongside our CEO and CTO including 2 women.
Our Growth Strategies
 
We are focused on empowering end users, developers, channel partners and the organizations they serve to quickly and easily access and integrate real-time geospatial intelligence into their daily operations and also prove out technologies to further grow the space ecosystem. Our growth strategy is driven by the following objectives:
 
Increase our overall customer base. We are an established heritage aerospace firm that is a part of the political and secular shift towards space-based data coming from commercial satellite and intelligence providers. We have the opportunity to expand our current customer base through a combination of direct and indirect sales strategies. We also plan to grow our direct sales teams and indirect sales channels.
 
Expand within our current customer base. As our space-as-a-service offerings grows and delivers results, we expect that our current customers will increase their spending on our services.
 
Continue to penetrate international markets. We have increased our focus on international markets. We have a current pipeline of prospective small underrepresented international governments and firms that can benefit from our support and services.
 
Grow distribution channels and channel partner ecosystem. We plan to invest in distribution channels and in our relationships with technology partners, solution providers, strategic global system integrators, solution partners, and value-added-resellers to help us enter into and expand in new markets while complementing our direct sales efforts. We have also established a Joint Cooperation and Marketing Agreement with Dhruva, India’s first private space company, to co-market, and sell our services in other countries.
 
Global Space Economy Overview
 
In recent years, the importance of the space economy has been growing as technological advances in both satellites and supporting terrestrial technologies have enabled new commercial use cases. These use cases include satellite broadband, remote imaging, Internet-of-Things (“IOT”)/Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) communications, defense-related applications, as well as others. As a result, several new and existing operators have announced new satellite constellations to serve these use cases. Many of these announced constellations will consist of small LEO satellites rather than large GEO satellites. According to a October 2019 SpaceNews report, SpaceX alone has filed for up to 30,000, and Amazon and OneWeb have also announced plans to launch a significant number of satellites.
 
According to Morgan Stanley research, as reported in February 2021, the $350 billion global space industry could surge to over $1 trillion by 2040. In addition, Euroconsult expects that over the next decade, the total manufacturing and launch market value for small satellites is expected to reach $54.2 billion, more than three times the market value over 2011-2020. Although this indicates significant growth, it does not reflect the four-fold increase in the number of satellites resulting from the rise of cubesats, constellations and the introduction of low-cost systems for both manufacturing and launch, which will reduce average costs and market value. 4
 
Rapid growth in private investment in the commercial space industry has led to a wave of new companies reinventing major elements of the traditional space industry, including human spaceflight, satellites, and launch, in addition to unlocking entirely new market segments. Furthermore, government agencies have realized the value of the private commercial space industry and have become increasingly more supportive and reliant on private companies to catalyze innovation and advance national space objectives. In the United States, this has been evidenced by notable policy initiatives and by commercial contractors’ growing share of space activity.

Launch Market
 
We are witnessing a shift in the launch requirements of satellite operators, as the launch industry adjusts to the increasing volume of launches and the shift from larger satellites to smallsats. According to a study, conducted and published by the NASA Ames Research Center in 2016, in recent years, the satellite market has been undergoing a major evolution with new space companies replacing the traditional approach of deploying a few large, complex and costly satellites with a multitude of smaller, less complex and cheaper satellites. This new approach has created a sharp increase in the number of launched satellites and so the historic trends are no longer representative.
 
The launch industry’s initial response was the introduction of ridesharing, allowing multiple operators to share the cost of a large launch vehicle. This combined with the emergence of new launch vehicles reduced launch costs and increased access to space for small satellite operators. However, operators must wait until a particular rideshare is full for their launch. In addition, all small satellites on a single rideshare are delivered to a single orbital destination. From there, small satellites must either complete a time-consuming orbit raise to their desired orbit, requiring a significant on-board propulsion system or an in-space shuttle. While in-space shuttling reduces the need for satellite propulsion capability, shuttles add significant expense and take weeks or months to reach the desired orbit.
 
Small Satellite Market
 
Another paradigm shift in the commercial space market is the rise of the small satellite market. Starting several years ago in 2018, the space industry began a dramatic transformation. Demand for large geosynchronous communications satellites dramatically declined as companies prepared to launch constellations of hundreds or thousands of smaller, less expensive broadband satellites in low and medium Earth orbits. Euroconsult anticipates that about 13,910 satellites <500 kg will be launched in the next ten years, according to the 7th edition of its small satellite market report released in April 2021. This total represents a 38% increase over the 10,100 satellites that were expected in its previous edition.
 
Moreover, the rise of this market has also created a new market segment in nanosatellites and microsatellites, weighing less than 10 kg and between 10 and 100 kg, respectively. While these satellites can be deployed individually, they can also be operated as part of a constellation, a large group of satellites interconnected to provide a service, such as the Starlink satellite constellation’s offering of global internet connectivity. According to Euroconsult’s April 2021 small satellite market report, the next decade will be defined primarily by the rollout of multiple constellations, which will account for 84% of smallsats, mainly for commercial operators.
 
The number of small satellites launched has increased from 39 in 2011 to 1,202 in 2020. In just the period between 2019 to 2020 there has been over 300% growth going from 289 to 1202. According to a report published in 2021 by Bryce Space & Technology, 40% of all smallsats launched in last 10 years were launched in 2020.
 
The growth in the satellite constellations market is being driven by technological advances in ground equipment, new business models, expanded funding, and growing demand for high bandwidth and lower latency. Though this satellite constellations market remains nascent in maturity, we anticipate considerable growth over the coming years in the launch industry as companies continue to seek versatile and low-cost ways to deliver single satellites to specific orbits or deploy their satellite constellations. Furthermore, we anticipate the growth of the satellite constellations market to contribute business to our Satellite Services offerings. LEO satellite constellations have relatively short lifespans on orbit, resulting in a requirement to launch replenishment satellites every few years.
 
According to Prospects for the Small Satellite Market – A Euroconsult Report 7th Edition April 2021, smallsats are often viewed by entrepreneurs as enablers of disruptive business models because of the growing data needs of the digital economy. Rapid, constant improvement of smallsats from one generation to the next means new capabilities and possibilities may constantly be developed. Further, investment in the space industry is still accelerating from 2020 and beyond. Vertically-integrated players attract the most funding. In the growing smallsat industry, with lower entry barriers and shorter timeframes, tangible investment opportunities in manufacturing are available. Just between 2018 and 2020, start-ups involved in smallsat integration raised $1.4B (SpaceX excluded) while pure smallsat subsystems manufacturers, $0.2B. Among integrators, by far the most successful recipients of funding are vertically-integrated players who produce and operate their own constellation while directly providing service to the end user. Vertical integration becomes especially relevant when there is a recurring production need (e.g. limited lifetimes, need for cyclical replacements) and when economies of scale are possible. It can also be driven by the need to secure its supply chain and keeping key differentiators in house, or when no compatible supply is available.

Customer / Market Research
 
The need to provide commercial testing capabilities in space has been growing for many years and has become a requirement for many innovating companies. According to Euroconsult’s Prospectus for the Small Satellite Market, 8th Edition released in July of 2022, Euroconsult reported 1,738 small satellites were launched in 2021 which is 1.5x more than 2020 (1,195 small satellites launched in 2020). The small satellite industry is gearing up for significant expansion in terms of capabilities and demand. According to Euroconsult’s report, the number of satellites to be launched from 2022 to 2031 is estimated to be 18,500. As the small satellite market grows, the requirement for rapid flight proven testing is becoming more crucial. Although ground-based testing is available, it does not provide a mirrored testing environment for spacecraft and subcomponent testing. We intend to address this need with our Sidus Constellation. Furthermore, customization of the Sidus Constellation with appropriate technology can provide subscription data and imagery services for customers whose needs prompt consideration for a separate constellation. Currently, our core market corresponds most directly with satellite manufacturing and offering LEO space-as-a-service solutions. However, we believe our addressable market can also continue to expand in similar and adjacent industries such as government and defense manufacturing. We have generated space-related manufacturing revenue since 2012, and we have been generating revenue from our commercial constellation space offering since the first quarter of 2022 as we continue to finalize customers for LizzieSat-1 (LS-1) and subsequent missions. We signed a multi-launch agreement with SpaceX for five LizzieSat rideshare missions beginning in 2023. These five satellite missions support previously announced customers as well as potential future customers as we continue to layer new missions into our pipeline.

Sales and Marketing
 
We market our services to both government and commercial customers. Initially we are leveraging our existing relationships to help promote our expanded service offerings. We believe our executive management team has extensive reach in the space and satellite industry.
 
Our marketing efforts focus on communicating the benefits of our solutions and educating our customers, the media and analysts about the advantages of our innovative technology. We strive to raise the awareness of our company, market our products and generate sales leads through industry events, public relations efforts, marketing materials, social media and our website. Attendance at key industry events is an important component of our marketing efforts. Our CEO, Carol Craig, has been invited to speak and participate in panel discussions at industry events and will continue to take advantage of these opportunities to spread awareness of our services. We believe a combination of these efforts strengthens our brand and may enhance our market position in our industry.
 
Competition
 
The small satellite services industry at-large is highly competitive but has significant barriers to entry, including the cost and difficulty associated with successfully developing, building, and launching a satellite constellation and obtaining various governmental and regulatory approvals. In addition to cost, there is a significant amount of lead time associated with obtaining the required licenses, building, and launching the satellite constellation, and developing and deploying the ground station technology. We currently face substantial general competition from other service providers that offer a range of space-based data collection options. There are also several competitors working to develop innovative solutions to compete in this industry.
Our Competitive Differentiation
 
We believe that we are well-positioned to compete with legacy space-based data providers and other emergent providers due to our vertical integration strategy that combines rapid production with flexible technology insertion points. This approach enables us to address three primary barriers that have limited the legacy industry in achieving a broader market adoption and penetration including: easy access to data and information, access to low-cost data, and customized, bespoke response to customer needs. Key elements of our competitive differentiation include the following:
 
Low-cost sensor data capture. Our smallsat constellation is leveraging the disruptive economics of small satellites to enable us to capture data in a more cost-effective manner than legacy satellite providers. We can deliver our proprietary geospatial imagery on demand at a lower cost than legacy providers due to our cost-efficiencies, capital efficient constellation design, and adaptable, disruptive pricing models, among other things, which enables us to expand our customer base to commercial organizations that have previously been priced out of the geospatial intelligence market.
 
On-demand delivery of low-cost geospatial analytics through subscription contracts to commercial customers. Geospatial intelligence and analytics have generally been prohibitively expensive for many commercial customers, with price points geared towards government end users. Our constellation is designed to provide our services to commercial customers at a low cost, which we expect will expand our base of potential customers. Our data monetization strategy includes selling data directly to other companies and consumers, selling data to data aggregation firms, listing our data on a data marketplace and leveraging a white label data commerce platform.
 
Proprietary, low-cost smallsat assembly. We design satellites and manufacture our satellites in-house. Controlling the satellite production process from design through manufacturing enables us to upgrade our satellites during production, integrate customer technologies and data needs at various points during the entire production cycle and continuously improve our satellites’ capabilities, as well as build out and maintain our optimal constellation size at a relatively low cost. Our low-cost satellites benefit from longer life and decreasing launch and on-orbit costs and our planned multi-mission constellation with vertical integration equals efficient use of capital expenses.

Our Intellectual Property
 
We continually invest in innovative solutions and as of December 31, 2022 have 6 space related patents approved or pending, which ownership was transferred to us by our majority shareholder, Craig Technologies, at no charge. Our patented technologies include a print head for regolith-polymer mixture and associated feedstock for which a notice of allowance was received by us in October 2021; a heat transfer system for regolith which patent expires in June 2039; a method for establishing a wastewater bioreactor environment which patent expires in July 2039; vertical takeoff and landing pad and interlocking pavers to construct same which patent expires in April 2039; and high-load vacuum chamber motion feedthrough systems and methods which patent expires in May 2039.
 
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual rights. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies, the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and other security measures. We have registered a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries and have a number of patent filings pending determination. There can be no assurance, however, that these rights can be successfully enforced against competitive products in any particular jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and contracts has value, the rapidly changing technology in the satellite and wireless communications industries and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protections afforded by patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual rights.
 
Certain of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
 
The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant, or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 
The commercial space industry is driven by rapidly changing technologies and innovation, and our success will require significant expenditure in Research and Development to develop new technologies, services, products, and offerings. Thus far, we have not established a Research and Development department, nor have we incurred research and development expenses. We do not currently perform formal R&D and instead we engineer our solutions with additional enhancements and innovations as part of our normal design and engineering efforts. We intend on setting up a formal Research and Development team in the future so we can more easily streamline our new products and get to market faster. If we fail to raise adequate funds to develop a robust Research and Development department and strategy, we will likely be unable to execute on our business plan.
 
Regulatory
 
Our business is subject to extensive rules, regulations, statutes, orders and policies imposed by the government in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
 
International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
 
We are required to comply with the laws and regulations of, and often obtain approvals from, national and local authorities in connection with our services. As we expand service to additional countries and regions, we will become subject to additional governmental approvals and regulations. We will provide a number of services that rely on the use of radio-frequency spectrum, and the provision of such services is highly regulated. Satellites are to be operated in a manner consistent with the regulations and procedures of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”), a specialized agency of the United Nations, which require the coordination of the operation of satellite systems in certain circumstances, and more generally are intended to avoid the occurrence of harmful interference among different users of the radio spectrum.

We have received approval of International Telecommunications Union (ITU) spectrum licensing for both X-Band and S-Band frequencies. We filed for X-Band and S-Band Radio Frequencies licensing in February 2021 and were granted approval through a published filing by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) on April 4, 2021. The ITU is the specialized agency responsible for principles and licensing of the use of orbit and spectrum. Before a satellite can use the spectrum and orbital resources it needs to fulfil its mission, it requires an associated ‘satellite filing’. The filing is a tool to obtain international recognition of these resources.
 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) and Export Controls
 
Our business is subject to, and we must comply with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the ITAR and Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) of the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The ITAR generally restricts the export of hardware, software, technical data, and services that have defense or strategic applications. The EAR similarly regulates the export of hardware, software, and technology that has commercial or “dual-use” applications (i.e., for both military and commercial applications) or that have less sensitive military or space-related applications that are not subject to the ITAR. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S.
 
The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering the ITAR and the EAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. The agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying, or conditioning authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Missile Technology Control Regime concerning the spaceflight business.
 
Many different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control rules. In particular, we are required to maintain registration under the ITAR; determine the proper licensing jurisdiction and classification of products, software, and technology; and obtain licenses or other forms of U.S. government authorizations to engage in activities, including the performance by foreign persons, related to and who support our spaceflight business. Under the ITAR, we must receive permission from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to release controlled technology to foreign person employees and other foreign persons.
 
Employees/Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 64 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. Our workforce is concentrated in the “Florida Space Coast,” however we are accustomed to working as a cohesive team with remote workers which should be beneficial as we expand and add employees in different geographical areas nationwide and worldwide. Our management team is comprised of our CEO and six (6) of her direct reports who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business. Our management team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human capital assets, particularly our diversity, capability development, and succession planning. Accordingly, we regularly review employee development and succession plans for each of our functions to identify and develop our pipeline of talent.
