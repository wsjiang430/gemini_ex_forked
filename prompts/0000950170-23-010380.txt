 Overview
We are a global late-stage clinical messenger RNA medicines and vaccine company focused on the development of infectious disease vaccines and significant opportunities within liver and respiratory rare diseases. In addition to our messenger RNA (“mRNA”) platform, our proprietary lipid nanoparticle (“LNP”) delivery system, LUNAR®, has the potential to enable multiple nucleic acid medicines, and our proprietary self-amplifying mRNA technology (Self-Transcribing and Replicating RNA, or STARR, technology) has the potential to provide longer-lasting RNA and sustained protein expression at lower dose levels as compared to conventional mRNA.
 We are leveraging our proprietary LUNAR platform and our nucleic acid technologies to develop and advance a pipeline of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases and rare genetic disorders with significant unmet medical needs. We continue to expand this platform by adding new innovative delivery solutions that allow us to expand our discovery efforts. Our proprietary LUNAR technology is intended to address the major hurdles in RNA drug development, namely the effective and safe delivery of RNA therapeutics to disease-relevant target tissues. We believe the versatility of our platform to target multiple tissues, its compatibility with various nucleic acid therapeutics, and our expertise in developing scalable manufacturing processes can allow us to deliver on the next generation of nucleic acid medicines.
 We were a preclinical company until June 2020, when we initiated our first Phase 1 study for our mRNA-based therapeutic candidate for ornithine transcarbamylase (“OTC”) deficiency. We launched our COVID-19 vaccine program in March of 2020, and we progressed to a late-stage clinical company in September 2021 with the initiation of the Phase 3 arm of a Phase 1/2/3 study in Vietnam for ARCT-154, our lead self-amplifying mRNA vaccine candidate against COVID-19.
Our vaccines franchise, led by our self-amplifying mRNA based COVID-19 program, made significant strides in 2022. In April 2022, the Phase 1/2/3 study in Vietnam of ARCT-154, our lead self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidate, completed dosing of over 19,000 participants and we announced that ARCT-154 met its primary efficacy endpoint in the study. In November 2022, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “CSL Collaboration Agreement”) with Seqirus, Inc. (“CSL Seqirus”), a part of CSL Limited, and one of the world’s leading influenza vaccine providers, for the global exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize self-amplifying mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, influenza and three other respiratory infectious diseases with non-exclusive rights to pandemic pathogens. The CSL Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 8, 2022. The collaboration combines CSL Seqirus’ established global vaccine commercial and manufacturing infrastructure with Arcturus’ manufacturing expertise and innovative STARR self-amplifying mRNA vaccine and LUNAR® delivery platform technologies. Under the framework of our collaboration with CSL Seqirus, we are evaluating in preclinical studies the efficacy and safety of a seasonal influenza vaccine (our LUNAR-FLU mRNA vaccine candidate). Pursuant to a third party study agreement executed in December 2022 with Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Meiji”), a Japanese leader in the area of infectious disease, a Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCT-154 was initiated in Japan by Meiji to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a booster shot of ARCT-154, and to evaluate non-inferiority of ARCT-154 as a booster. The trial targeted a total of 780 adult participants, with half in the ARCT-154 group and half in a comparator group (Comirnaty®, Pfizer-BioNTech), and completed enrollment with 828 participants in February 2023.
 We continued to advance our rare disease pipeline and collaborations. In our ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency program, the Phase 1b single ascending dose study of ARCT-810 (LUNAR-OTC) in adults with OTC deficiency completed dosing of the initial three dose cohorts in November 2022. The protocol was amended to add a fourth dose cohort, and we anticipate full enrollment in the second quarter of 2023. Furthermore, our Phase 2 multiple ascending dose study of ARCT-810 in OTC-deficient adolescents and adults has been approved in several countries including the UK, Spain, Belgium, France and Sweden and the first patient was dosed in December 2022. We expect to release interim data on a subset of participants in 2023 in conjunction with the declaration of additional liver therapeutic programs. For the cystic fibrosis program, results from a series of nonclinical studies have led us to an optimized formulation and aerosol delivery system that is being advanced into the clinic. A First-in-Human study for ARCT-032 (LUNAR-CF), our mRNA therapeutic candidate for cystic fibrosis, has successfully dosed the first two cohorts in New Zealand and intends to enroll 32 participants to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics at four dose levels.
We also continued to make significant progress with our platform technologies and with product development, manufacturing processes and operations. In addition to general development of our LUNAR platform, we continued to test and expand enabling technologies of our platform, including genome editing and immuno-oncology. With our sourcing partners, we manufactured cGMP batches (current good manufacturing practices) yielding significant quantities of clinical trial materials for global studies of our candidates, including ARCT-810 (LUNAR-OTC) and ARCT-154 (LUNAR-COV19).
 Nucleic Acid Medicines and an Introduction to Arcturus’ Platform Technologies
 Nucleic Acid Medicines
 Nucleic acid medicines have the potential to treat diseases caused by genetic mutations, including diseases that cannot be treated by conventional drugs, such as small molecules and biologics. Some of these medicines function by providing the means for producing a deficient yet vital protein in vivo. Within a cell, DNA carries the blueprint, in the form of genes, from which all proteins necessary for life are encoded. Each gene’s code is transcribed into a nucleic acid molecule called mRNA, which informs the cell’s own machinery how to organize amino acid building blocks to make one or more proteins needed for normal biological function.
Nucleic acid therapeutics represent a significant advancement in targeted medicines and several of this class of therapeutics are being developed by public and private companies. The general objectives of these therapies include:
 •to increase the amount of a functioning target protein by introducing a functional gene or mRNA that encodes for a protein that replaces a malfunctioning protein (mRNA therapy, CRISPR, gene therapy);
 
•to restore a functional protein by correcting its encoding mRNA sequence;
 
•to reduce the amount of a target protein in a patient by binding to and destroying the associated target mRNA (antisense and small interfering RNA (“siRNA”)); and
 
•to introduce proteins from viruses or malfunctioning proteins in certain cancers to train the immune system to recognize and clear these proteins (nucleic acid vaccines).
 
Brief Introduction to our LUNAR® and STARR Technology Platforms
 LUNAR®
 A key challenge for nucleic acid medicines is the safe and effective delivery of the nucleic acid molecule. We have developed a novel lipid-mediated delivery system called LUNAR. LUNAR is a multi-component drug delivery system that incorporates a mixture of novel biodegradable lipids. Lipids are molecules that contain hydrocarbons and make up the building blocks of the structure and function of living cells. Examples of lipids include fats, oils, waxes, certain hormones and most of the cell membrane that is not made up of protein. LUNAR is designed to address technical challenges facing the delivery of nucleic acid medicines into cells. We continue to expand our library of proprietary lipids, termed ATX, with over 250 to date. Our preclinical studies have shown that formulations can be customized for the indication and target cell type of interest, and we have also demonstrated that our formulation process is scalable and reproducible. Our LUNAR platform is described in more detail below.
STARR
 Our STARR technology is our proprietary self-amplifying mRNA (or saRNA) technology platform. When combined with a delivery system, such as our lipid-mediated delivery system LUNAR, the STARR technology has the potential to generate a protective immune response or drive therapeutic protein expression to prevent against or treat a variety of diseases. Self-amplifying RNA-based prophylactic vaccines developed with STARR may trigger rapid and prolonged antigen expression within host cells affording patients protective immunity against infectious pathogens. We have clinically shown that the combination of LUNAR and STARR technology results in lower dose requirements (accompanied by fewer side effects) due to superior immune response and sustained protein expression compared to non-self-amplifying RNA-based vaccines and enables us to produce greater volumes of vaccine doses more quickly. With the full enrollment of the pivotal Phase 1/2/3 study in Vietnam of ARCT-154, our next generation, self-amplifying mRNA-based vaccine candidate against COVID-19, and the initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial of ARCT-154 in Japan, we are a global leader in the clinical development of self-amplifying RNA-based vaccines. Our STARR platform is described in more detail below.

Vaccines in Development
 According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, over 50,000 people die each year due to vaccine-preventable diseases and related complications in the United States alone. Influenza and pneumonia cases approach this number of deaths each year and more than one million individuals in the United States have died of COVID since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The Department of Health and Human Services estimated that 330,000 lives were saved in the United States due to COVID-19 vaccination in 2021 alone. Outbreaks of new infectious diseases, and the rise of variants to existing viruses, create demand for new and novel approaches to producing vaccines in a more cost effective and quicker manner.
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the efficacy, safety, and rapidity in which nucleic acid medicines can be used to vaccinate vulnerable populations. In 2020, we initiated the development of our first self-amplifying mRNA vaccine candidate, ARCT-021, to protect against COVID-19 and commenced a Phase 1/2 trial in 2020 and two Phase 2 trials in 2021. In 2021, we began development of two next generation vaccine candidates designed to elicit an improved neutralizing antibody response to circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, including our lead self-amplifying mRNA vaccine candidate against COVID-19, ARCT-154. In April 2022, dosing of over 19,000 participants was completed in a Phase 1/2/3 study of ARCT-154 in Vietnam, and we announced that ARCT-154 met its primary efficacy endpoint in the study. We also expanded our vaccine franchise to include seasonal influenza.
Progress in our vaccine franchise was highlighted in 2022 by the entry into the CSL Collaboration Agreement with CSL Seqirus for the global exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize self-amplifying mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, influenza and three other respiratory infectious diseases with non-exclusive rights to pandemic pathogens. The CSL Collaboration Agreement became effective in December 2022. The collaboration combines CSL Seqirus’ established global vaccine commercial and manufacturing infrastructure with Arcturus’ manufacturing expertise and innovative STARR self-amplifying mRNA vaccine and LUNAR® delivery platform technologies.

 Development Program – COVID-19
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can lead to respiratory illness. Three viruses in this family have emerged in the past twenty years; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, there have been surges of infections as protective health measures have waxed and waned. Uncontrolled viral spread has led to approximately half a billion cases worldwide and the selection of viral variants that are more contagious, pathogenic, or both. Since late 2021, infections have been dominated by subvariants of the Omicron strain which continue to displace previous circulating strains by evading immunity and spreading more efficiently resulting in an increased risk of breakthrough infection among the vaccinated. Despite the expeditious Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) and rollout of vaccines in many
countries, vaccine efficacy rates vary widely to currently circulating variants. Additionally, relatively low percentages of people worldwide have received booster doses, including doses of a bivalent booster that encode Omicron spike, important for protection against rapidly emerging Omicron sub-strains.
As the world pivots from a pandemic to an endemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infections, primary and booster vaccines that induce a robust and durable immunity against current and emerging variants of concern (“VOCs”) can help to reduce the infection and disease burden for both the public and the health care systems globally. As such, we are developing the next generation of mRNA vaccines, which have demonstrated encouraging antibody data, including neutralizing antibodies against several variants of concern, including Omicron, boosting pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
 Our initial COVID-19 vaccine candidate, ARCT-021, developed in conjunction with Duke-NUS Medical School, is based on our STARR (self-amplifying mRNA) technology platform and demonstrated antibody and cell-mediated immunogenicity and an excellent safety profile through Phase 2 clinical trials. This vaccine was designed to promote immune responses to the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the critical part of the virus that allows infection to occur.
Our next generation vaccine candidate, ARCT-154 is based on the same platform as ARCT-021. We modified the coding region to stabilize the spike protein and increase immune recognition to the receptor binding domain to improve neutralizing antibody titers and cross-protection to VOCs. Results to date have established the efficacy and safety of ARCT-154 in a large Phase 3 clinical trial in Vietnam.
 Phase 1/2 Study in United States, Singapore, and South Africa
In January 2022, we announced immunogenicity data for participants of a Phase 1/2 study being conducted in the United States and Singapore. Results from the arms where participants were dosed with five (5) mcg of ARCT-154 as a booster after at least five months of being vaccinated with two doses of Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) showed encouraging increases in levels of neutralizing antibody activity against D614G and several variants of concern (VoCs) and variants of interest (VoIs). In May 2022, we provided additional neutralization antibody activity data at Day 91 showing durability of neutralizing antibody response. Validated pseudovirus microneutralization (MNT) assay results for D614G variant showed a 28- and 40-fold increase in geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) on Day 15 and 29 after booster dose compared to pre-dose levels, respectively. The antibody levels remained elevated at 30-fold for Day 91 over pre-boost levels indicating the durability of the neutralizing antibody response. We also shared immunogenicity data obtained in a validated MNT assay against Beta variant and the data indicated similar durability of the neutralizing antibody response with the increases in GMFR of 26-, 31-, and 24-fold at Days 15, 29, and 91, respectively.
 From the same Phase 1/2 trial, we also reported data (exploratory MNT assay; Moore Laboratory, National Institute for Communicable Diseases and University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa (“MNT Assay; Moore Laboratory”)) demonstrating neutralizing antibody immune response to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants, BA.1 and BA.2, in participants that received ARCT-154 as booster. Omicron-specific pseudovirus MNT assay results demonstrated neutralizing antibody titers of 54-fold (BA.1) and 46-fold (BA.2) GMFRs over baseline on Day 29 post-boost in ARCT-154 arm (n=12).
In August 2022, we reported additional data (MNT Assay; Moore Laboratory) from the Phase 1/2 trial demonstrating sustained neutralizing antibody immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants, BA.1 and BA.2 at Day 91 post-boost in the ARCT-154 arm (n=12). Omicron-specific pseudovirus MNT assay results demonstrated neutralizing antibody titers of 44-fold (BA.1) and 39-fold (BA.2) at Day 91 post-boost.
 The following additional data from the Phase 1/2 trial demonstrates robust binding and neutralizing antibody titers out to 9 months post-vaccination with ARCT-154 boost. In an exploratory pseudovirus neutralization assay, durable neutralizing antibody responses were observed with antibody GMFR increases at Day 271 from baseline (Day 1) of 41-, 30-, and 19-fold for Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5, respectively (Figure X). Similar data has been generated for Omicron BA.1 on a validated microneutralization assay. Additionally, in an ACE2 surrogate neutralization panel, greater than a 4-fold GMFR was observed at Day 271 across all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants (Figure Y). Data through the end of study for boosted participants is expected in Q2 2023.


Figure X: Exploratory pseudovirus microneutralization (MNT) assay results, showing GMFR levels of neutralizing antibody responses over Day 1 (baseline levels prior to boosting with ARCT-154) calculated with virus neutralization concentrations (with 95% confidence intervals) obtained for participants (for BA.1, BA.2, and BA.4/5: n = 12/12, up to Day 91; n=9, Day 181; n=8, Day 271). Data from participants with verified COVID-19 were left out of the analysis.

 Phase 1/2/3 Study in Vietnam
During 2021, we entered into a collaboration with Vinbiocare Biotechnology Joint Stock Company (“Vinbiocare”), a member company of the Vingroup Joint Stock Company (Vingroup) group of companies. As part of a collaboration with Vinbiocare, ARCT-154, our investigational next generation, self-amplifying mRNA-based vaccine for COVID-19, was advanced into a Phase 1/2/3 study in Vietnam, funded and sponsored by Vinbiocare (the “Vinbiocare Study”). The trial is randomized, observer-blinded, placebo and active-controlled and is intended to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of ARCT-154. The Phase 3 arm of the Phase 1/2/3 study was initiated in September 2021. The study enrolled over 19,000 adult subjects in Vietnam, including individuals with medical conditions putting them at higher risk of severe complications of COVID-19. The Phase 3 placebo-controlled efficacy portion of the study enrolled over 16,000 participants.
In February 2022, Vinbiocare provided safety and immunogenicity data from the placebo-controlled Phase 1/2/3a portions of the study with approximately 1,000 participants. In April 2022, Vinbiocare shared results from the vaccine safety and efficacy analysis of Phase 3b participants. The vaccine primary efficacy endpoint in the placebo-controlled Phase 3b portion of the study was met. Analysis of the data demonstrated that two 5-mcg doses of ARCT-154 administered 28 days apart resulted in vaccine efficacy of 55.0% (95% CI; 46.9% - 61.9%) for protection against COVID-19 overall and 95.3% (95% CI; 80.4% - 98.9%) against severe and fatal COVID-19, respectively. Nine COVID-19 related deaths were reported in the placebo group and one in the ARCT-154 vaccinated group. The single death in the ARCT-154 vaccination arm occurred in an older age group participant who was also at increased risk of severe COVID-19. During the window when COVID-19 cases in the study were detected, the prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strain associated with COVID-19 infections in Vietnam was Delta.
 Review of safety data has been performed by Vinbiocare from over 17,000 participants in the placebo-controlled Phase 1/2/3 portions through one month after second dose of ARCT-154. The incidence of unsolicited events was found to be comparable in the vaccinated and placebo groups and no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis have been reported so far. Analysis of solicited events also demonstrated that most events were mild or moderate in severity.
 Additional data shared by Vinbiocare shows that the study also met the immunogenicity primary endpoint, with 98.4% 4-fold seroconversion for ancestral (Wuhan) strain, measured by surrogate virus neuralization test (sVNT) 28 days after the second dose of ARCT-154. This Vinbiocare analysis was conducted in approximately 1,000 participants enrolled in the Phase 1/2/3a study. The last visit for last subject in this study occurred in Q1 2023 and a six (6) month analysis of safety along with expanded immunogenicity assessment is underway. More comprehensive immunogenicity, efficacy and safety data from the study will be disclosed at a later time.
On October 31, 2022, Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Study Support Agreement (the “Vinbiocare Support Agreement”) with Vinbiocare, in furtherance of the Vinbiocare Study, to provide for Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. to conduct certain services and take on material financial responsibilities for certain matters to help achieve the objectives of the Vinbiocare Study.
 The Vinbiocare Support Agreement provides that we will make certain limited payments to Vinbiocare, including upon the occurrence of specified events through the first quarter of 2025. Vinbiocare is also eligible to receive a single digit percentage of amounts received by Arcturus on net sales, if any, of ARCT-154 (or next-generation COVID vaccine) up to a capped amount, subject to the limitations set forth in the Vinbiocare Support Agreement.
Phase 3 Non-Inferiority Study of ARCT-154 in Japan
 Meiji is sponsoring a randomized, multicenter, Phase 3, observer-blind, active-controlled comparative study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a booster shot of ARCT-154 and to evaluate non-inferiority of ARCT-154 as a booster. The study targeted a total of 780 adult participants, with half in the ARCT-154 group and half in a comparator group, and completed enrollment with 828 participants in February 2023.
Vaccine Platform Stability Data
New data regarding the product format, stability and cold chain characteristics of our lyophilized COVID-19 vaccine compares favorably to existing COVID-19 vaccine stability requirements. The lyophilized powder
demonstrated room temperature stability for four (4) days (25°C; 60% RH), refrigerator stability for six (6) months (2-8°C), and long-term stability for 18 months (-25°C to -15°C). The vaccines are approved for shipping at 2-8°C and notably, remain stable in the event of temperature cycling.
 Development Program – LUNAR-qsFLU (Quadrivalent Seasonal Influenza)
Influenza is estimated to cause one billion infections globally every year and hundreds of thousands of deaths, especially in the elderly and individuals with underlying medical conditions. In many regions, influenza is seasonal, with infections peaking during November through April in the Northern Hemisphere and May through September in the Southern Hemisphere. Year-round surveillance by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) in collaboration with various national health agencies informs WHO recommendations on the strains of influenza most likely to spread during the upcoming influenza season. National health agencies (such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)) then make the final decision of which strains should be covered by vaccines licensed in their country.
 Our LUNAR-qsFLU (qs; quadrivalent seasonal) program, now exclusively licensed to CSL Seqirus, has the objective of producing a safe and effective seasonal influenza vaccine candidate with significant advantages over the traditional egg-based inactivated quadrivalent vaccine. Inaccurate predictions of circulating influenza strains as well as mutations due to adaptation in egg-grown vaccines can substantially reduce efficacy on a year-to-year basis. We believe the ability of mRNA platforms to nimbly adapt to new viral strains should help improve efficacy. In addition, we do not expect mRNA vaccines to face the challenge from mutations common to egg-grown vaccines.
 Increasing evidence supports that immunity against the neuraminidase (NA), the second most abundant influenza surface protein, along with hemagglutinin (HA) specific immunity protects against influenza disease (Krammer et al, mBIO, 2018). While most currently licensed vaccines contain some neuraminidase, the amount is not standardized, and currently licensed vaccines do not induce robust anti-neuraminidase immune responses. LUNAR-qsFLU, in addition to targeting robust anti-HA responses, also encodes the neuraminidase from each of the four strains recommended by the FDA for quadrivalent cell-based vaccines. Targeting both the HA and NA may have a protective benefit over current vaccines during seasons even when vaccine strains are not well matched to circulating strains (Sandbulte et al, PNAS, 2011).
LUNAR-qsFLU has been designed to take advantage of our expertise in both LUNAR® lipid delivery systems and our STARR self-amplifying mRNA technology. This platform has been shown to deliver effective protection against COVID-19 and has been optimized to elicit robust immunogenicity with acceptable reactogenicity at a lower dose than conventional mRNA vaccines with the aspiration of creating a highly effective influenza vaccine for use in general and high risk populations.
 In the graph below, mice pre-immunized with hemagglutinins from historical influenza strains (to simulate non-naïve immunity in humans) were immunized with a single dose of LUNAR-qsFLU (two target formulations) or two licensed comparator vaccines. All vaccines encoded antigens from the FDA recommended strains from 2022/23 influenza season. We observed similar or better responses against both the HA and NA components in both LUNAR-qsFLU formulations compared to licensed vaccines.



Figure: Mice previously exposed (i.e. pre-immunized) to historical H1 and H3 HA antigens to better mimic a non-naïve response typical in humans were vaccinated once with LUNAR-FLU and comparator vaccines. HA-specific responses were comparable to licensed vaccines. NA-specific titers, however, surpassed responses elicited by licensed comparators.
 Results from naïve mice using a single 2ug dose of LUNAR-qsFLU show robust and durable functional inhibition responses to both the HA and the NA components of LUNAR-qsFLU. Even three months post vaccination, titers remain nearly unchanged.


Figure: Mice were vaccinated once with LUNAR-qsFLU formulated with either LNP-1 or LNP-2. Both formulations resulted in robust hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titers and neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titers which indicate that mice produce antibodies that can functionally interfere with both receptors. These titers do not wane over the 84 days of the experiment. A similar durable response in humans would likely cover both the early and late influenza seasons.
 Development Program – LUNAR-pandFLU (Influenza)
In the second half of 2022, we expanded our influenza program to develop self-amplifying mRNA vaccine against pandemic influenza strains for rapid response. This program is funded by a $63.2M award from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. For a more comprehensive discussion of the funding award, please see Item 1 “Business” – “Revenue and Collaboration Arrangements and Other Material Agreements”
– “BARDA.” The ability to deliver an effective, lower dose, lyophilized pandemic influenza vaccine is consistent with the strategic objectives of the U.S. government’s National Strategy for Pandemic influenza.
Rare Disease Medicines in Development
 The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (the “Orphan Drug Act”) defines a rare disease as a disease affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. According to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), there are approximately 10,000 such diseases that, together, affect nearly 30 million people in the United States. The European Union (the “EU”) defines a rare disease as having a prevalence of fewer than five (5) in 10,000 people. Collectively, these disorders affect between 6% and 7% of the population in the developed world.
 There is a pressing need for new medicines for rare diseases as few of the 10,000 known rare diseases have approved treatments. Biopharmaceutical industry researchers are making great progress in the fight against some rare diseases as innovative science has opened new opportunities. More than 770 medicines have been approved by the FDA since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act and more than 800 medicines are currently in clinical development. Despite recent progress, there is more work to be done to overcome the scientific, operational and financial challenges that arise.
We believe our technology should provide an excellent platform to address genetically inherited rare diseases. Specifically, we are focusing on developing medicines to treat people with rare respiratory and liver diseases who currently have limited or no treatment options.
Rare Disease Program – ARCT-810 (LUNAR-OTC)
 The LUNAR-OTC development program addresses ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, a rare, life-threatening, genetic disease caused by mutations in the OTC gene that lead to dysfunctional or deficient OTC.
 OTC deficiency is the most common of the urea cycle disorders, a group of inherited metabolic disorders that are associated with reduced ability to eliminate ammonia from the body and has a population of over 5,000 patients in the United States and is prevalent in approximately one in 14,000 to one in 77,000 people worldwide. Ammonia is a toxic waste product produced from the breakdown of protein. OTC is a critical enzyme in the urea cycle, which takes place in liver cells and converts ammonia to urea which is eliminated in the urine. In patients with OTC deficiency, ammonia accumulates in the blood and is toxic to the brain and liver. Symptoms of high ammonia levels include vomiting, headaches, coma and death. OTC deficiency can cause developmental problems, seizures and death in newborn babies. As an X-linked disorder, OTC deficiency tends to be more severe in males, though female carriers are often affected. Patients with less severe symptoms may present later in life, as adults. Currently no cure exists for OTC deficiency apart from liver transplant; however, this treatment comes with significant risk of complications such as organ rejection, and transplant recipients must take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives. Current standard of care for OTC deficiency is a low-protein diet, dietary supplements, and ammonia scavengers to try to prevent accumulation of ammonia. Life-threatening episodes of high ammonia levels can occur, requiring treatment with dialysis or hemofiltration. These treatments do not address the underlying cause of disease and there remains a high unmet need for an effective treatment.
 Our LUNAR-OTC development candidate, ARCT-810, uses our LUNAR platform to deliver normal OTC mRNA into liver cells which then produce normal functioning OTC with possible disease-modifying effects. Our LUNAR-OTC approach has the potential to treat the underlying defect that causes the debilitating symptoms of OTC deficiency, rather than mitigating symptoms by sequestering ammonia. LUNAR-OTC has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for treatment of OTC deficiency. We have retained worldwide development and commercialization rights to ARCT-810.
 Preclinical data in OTC-deficient murine models have demonstrated that dosing of LUNAR-OTC results in robust OTC protein expression and activity, thereby improving ureagenesis, reducing plasma ammonia, and increasing survival.
 The Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, dose-escalation study of ARCT-810 in healthy volunteers, completed in November 2020, demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability and PK profiles.
A Phase 1b study in stable OTC-deficient adults is being conducted in the United States. The trial is designed to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of ARCT-810, as well as various exploratory biomarkers of drug activity. Twelve subjects in the 3 initially-planned dose cohorts have completed the study, and a fourth, higher-dose cohort was recently added and is expected to complete enrollment in Q2 2023. A Phase 2
multiple-dose study of ARCT-810 in OTC-deficient adolescents and adults initiated dosing in December 2022 and plans to enroll approximately 24 participants in 2 dose cohorts. The study has been approved by the regulatory authorities in the UK and several other countries in Europe. We anticipate that we will have interim data from a subset of participants in the second half of 2023.
Rare Disease Program - LUNAR-CF (Cystic Fibrosis)
 The LUNAR-CF program addresses cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, a progressive lung disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene. In 2020, we advanced ARCT-032 as a development candidate for treatment of cystic fibrosis. ARCT-032 uses our LUNAR® platform to deliver a codon-optimized CFTR mRNA into airway epithelial cells. This allows airway cells to produce functional human CFTR protein using native translational machinery and protein trafficking pathways which could result in the treatment of the underlying defect that causes CF lung disease, regardless of the specific mutation. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (“CFF”) has partnered with us to support development of this therapy. ARCT-032 represents the first LUNAR-based mRNA therapeutic delivered by the inhaled route, offering direct delivery to the affected airways with the possibility of restoring functional CFTR.
There are over 30,000 people living with CF in the United States, and a recent epidemiologic study reported over 100,000 cases worldwide. Approximately 800 people are newly-diagnosed with cystic fibrosis each year in the United States. Cystic fibrosis is caused by one of more than 2,000 known mutations in the CFTR gene. These mutations have been grouped into several different classes based on the mechanism by which they cause reduction in the production and/or function of the CFTR protein. When CFTR is absent or defective, the airway surfaces become dehydrated and coated with a layer of thick mucus that clogs the airways, causing difficulty breathing and often resulting in chronic infections, exaggerated inflammation, structural airway damage, and other serious complications in the lungs. CF is a multi-system disease that may also affect the pancreas, intestines, liver, sinuses, reproductive tract and sweat glands. The median predicted survival of CF patients born between 2017-2022 in the United States is approximately 53 years, and the cause of most of the mortality and morbidity is due to the lung disease.
Current palliative therapies for CF lung disease are directed towards existing lung disease and to prevent the progression of the disease. These treatments include aerosolized mucolytics, antibiotics, and airway clearance techniques that are time-consuming and represent a significant treatment burden for people with CF. Many CF patients ultimately suffer from a critical decline in lung function and require lung transplants.
The FDA has approved several CFTR modulator therapies (Kalydeco®, Orkambi®, Symdeko®, and Trikafta®) that assist certain classes of abnormal CFTR protein to reach the cell membrane and/or increase functional ion channel activity. The CFTR modulators, while effective in many patients, are mutation-specific and therefore are not effective in all persons with CF. Other treatments are required to target Class I mutations (no CFTR produced; approximately 10% of CF cases worldwide), and people who are intolerant or have poor response to CFTR modulator therapies. We are initially focusing ARCT-032 on these groups of patients, as they currently have the highest unmet needs for CF therapies.
Significant progress on the LUNAR-CF program was made in 2022, with reproducible demonstration of restoration of CFTR function in human bronchial epithelial cell cultures from CF donors, substantial functional improvement in a CF animal model, and the completion of the first-in-human enabling GLP toxicology studies. A CTA was filed in December 2022 for the first-in-human study, and the first two cohorts have been successfully dosed.
 An extensive portfolio of nonclinical studies support the advancement of ARCT-032 to the clinic. Our comprehensive data set showcasing the potential for ARCT-032 as a disease-modifying treatment has been presented at the major CF conferences in North America and Europe. To help predict eventual success in the clinic, it is necessary to demonstrate drug stability with aerosolization, the ability to target and transduce the target cells in the lungs, and the ability to restore CFTR function. Our data has demonstrated that (i) ARCT-032 remains stable after nebulization and retains functional activity, (ii) LUNAR protects mRNA in sputum isolated from CF patients, (iii) aerosolized LUNAR-mRNA delivers mRNA to airway epithelium across several species, (iv) LUNAR-mRNA transduced several epithelial cell types (secretory, ionocytes, basal, ciliated) in ferret and human bronchial epithelial cells, and (v) LUNAR-hCFTR restored CFTR activity in vivo (measured by nasal potential difference) in a CF mouse model with Class I mutations. In addition, as explained below, recent data demonstrates that ARCT-032 restores CFTR expression and function to wild-type levels in human bronchial epithelial cells from CF donors.
Finally, preliminary data show that ARCT-032 administered to CF ferrets effectively doubled the mucociliary transport rate in vivo. Cumulatively, we believe these robust data demonstrate the proof of concept to validate ARCT-032 as a potential therapy to target the root cause of CF lung disease.
 In vitro proof of concept of ARCT-032 was obtained using human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells cultured in an air-liquid interface system. HBE cells cultured in this manner undergo extensive differentiation, resulting in an in vitro model that is representative of the in vivo airway. The cells exhibit a pseudostratified morphology and are comprised of a heterogeneous cell population, including ionocytes, ciliated, basal, and secretory cells. Work performed at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) demonstrated that ARCT-032 (LUNAR-CFTR) treatment resulted in significantly higher chloride activity when compared to negative control (LUNAR-TdTomato). More importantly, after treatment with ARCT-032, cultures derived from patients with CF with the F508del mutation (F508del+/+) demonstrated that the chloride current had been restored, i.e., the chloride efflux was similar to HBE cells from people without CF (WT) that were used as a positive control (figure below). Additionally, western blot analysis of protein in the HBE cells showed higher levels of mature CFTR protein (C-band) in ARCT-032 treated cells when compared to non-CF donor control cells.

 As mentioned, earlier work has shown successful transduction of airway epithelial cells with LUNAR-mRNA in multiple species of healthy animals. We recently achieved similar success in a CF animal model. In collaboration with the University of Iowa and supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a double transgenic ferret model of CF was used to assess transduction of bronchial epithelial cells in diseased ferrets. Ferrets with the G551D mutation maintained on VX-770 (ivacaftor) developed a CF phenotype including thick mucus in the lungs when they were withdrawn from VX-770 treatment. LUNAR-Cre was administered to the airways by microsprayer, and the Cre recombinase mRNA-transduced cells switched off TdTomato expression (shown in red) and expressed EGFP (cells in green). This demonstrated the ability of LUNAR-Cre to penetrate the mucus layer and transduce the target pulmonary epithelial cells in CF-diseased ferrets.

The ferrets express TdTomato protein (red) by default; introduction of Cre recombinase mRNA (via LUNAR-Cre) results in Cre protein expression and excision of TdTomato enabling expression of EGFP (green). The panel on the left shows transduction with LUNAR-Cre of pulmonary epithelial cells lining the trachea, as evidenced by the conversion of TdTomato expression in red to EGFP expression in green. The panel on the right illustrates the ability of LUNAR-Cre LNPs to penetrate the mucus (outlined by a blue box) in a smaller bronchiole and transduce the underlying epithelial cells. The red-fluorescing cells are not transduced by LUNAR-Cre. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (blue).
 Further experiments with G551D CFTR-transgenic ferrets demonstrated in vivo proof of concept of ARCT-032 (LUNAR-CFTR) in this model system. VX-770 treatment was withdrawn from the ferrets and the animals were treated with either ARCT-032 or LUNAR-TdTomato. The LUNAR treatments were administered by a microsprayer. Mucociliary clearance was assessed by PET/CT scan while still on VX-770, after a few weeks of VX-770 washout, and 24 hours following the first and fourth doses. As shown in figure below, the mucociliary clearance in CF ferrets treated with ARCT-032 (green line) was about twice that of the ‘VX-770 Off’ baseline (black line), and comparable to or greater than that for ‘VX-770 On’ (turquoise line) after a single administration. Similar results were obtained from ferrets treated with four doses of ARCT-032.

Discovery Programs
Discovery Program – Hepatitis B (HBV)
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause both acute self-limiting and chronic infections of the liver, chronic hepatitis B (CHB), which may evolve to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Approximately 296 million people are chronically infected with HBV with an increased life-time risk of death developing from liver disease or HCC between 15% and 25%. Current treatment options have low functional cure rates, defined by serum HBsAg and HBV DNA levels measured below the lower limit of detection and maintained off-treatment. HBsAg loss in CHB patients is rarely achieved (i.e., approximately 1% per year) and therefore life-long treatment is needed to prevent reoccurrence of liver disease. For these reasons, there remains a strong need for finite, well-tolerated treatments with improved functional cure rates.
 When the HBV virus infects hepatocytes, it forms a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus, like a mini-chromosome, from which HBV transcripts are synthesized, including a complete copy of the HBV pre-genomic RNA that serves as a template for reverse transcription and replenishment of the cccDNA pool. HBV DNA can also integrate into the human genome, frequently inducing chromosomal rearrangements. Genomically-integrated DNA is a source of HBsAg transcripts, although it is generally assumed that no new HBV virus can be produced from integrated sequences. None of the available therapies can target and eliminate cccDNA or integrated DNA, thus there is the possibility of viral recrudescence even after a functional cure.
 LUNAR-HBV is a genome editing therapeutic consisting of engineered HBV-directed nucleases, delivered as mRNAs encapsulated in our proprietary liver-directed LUNAR® lipid nanoparticles that are able to target a conserved sequence of the HBV genome and irreversibly inactivate both cccDNA and integrated DNA.
 LUNAR-HBV was selected for functional genomic-HBV editing efficacy and further improved for reduced off-target activity. We have generated preclinical data demonstrating efficacy of LUNAR-HBV targeting both integrated and non-integrated HBV DNA in the liver of different HBV mouse models where we can achieve >2 Logs irreversible reduction of HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in the plasma. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this efficacy is due to gene editing of HBV DNA and reduction of nuclear HBV DNA levels.
In addition to this, LUNAR®-HBV showed a significant safety margin relative to the minimal efficacious dose either with single or repeat dosing. Biodistribution studies in mice show that the liver is the main target organ of LUNAR®-HBV with no genome editing activity detected in other organs. Furthermore, both the therapeutic mRNAs and proteins are short lived and are not detected in the liver 24 hours after dosing.
 Orthogonal scientific approaches, combined with a rigorous risk assessment, are being used to examine the potential genotoxicity of LUNAR-HBV. Bioinformatic predictions did not reveal any significant LUNAR-HBV potential off-target site and cell-based assays using the highest tolerated dose of mRNA encoding the genome editing nucleases (at least five-fold higher than the estimated therapeutic dose) preliminarily generated a small number of potential off-target sites at low occurrence. These potential sites are in non-coding regions of genomic areas not associated with any disease or disorder. Complementary studies are currently underway, to assess the potential risk of chromosomal rearrangements induced by LUNAR-HBV treatment.
 Ex-vivo assays using human PBMCs from multiple donors suggest a low risk of an immunogenic response to LUNAR HBV from pre-existing immunity. Furthermore, mice receiving repeat doses of LUNAR-HBV did not show evidence of an immunogenic response based on the absence of antibodies against the genome editing nucleases in the plasma and immune cells (T-cells, B-cells or NK cells) in the liver.
 We are currently completing the scale-up activities to generate material for the IND-enabling studies.

Right: Genome editing evaluation by Next Generation Sequencing of DNA extracted from the liver shows INDELs (insertion/deletions) only in the LUNAR®-HBV treated mice.
 Discovery Program - Phenylketonuria (PKU)
 Phenylketonurea (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by the buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in the body due to the lack or deficient activity of the enzyme responsible of its metabolism, phenylalanine hydroxilase (PAH). In PKU patients, high levels of phenylalanine affect normal nervous system function and can lead to brain disfunction and intellectual disability. Globally, approximately 1:10,000 newborns carry mutations in the PAH gene responsible for the PKU disease. Dietary restriction (low protein diet) has been the main therapeutic treatment to control Phe levels and, although successful, outcomes are not always optimal and patients often have difficulty adhering to it. There are only two approved treatments for PKU: Palynziq®, which requires injections that may lead to an immune response, and the synthetic PAH co-factor, BH4, Kuvan®, which only helps a subpopulation of PKU patients.
 The LUNAR® PKU program attempts to address the unmet needs of PKU patients by delivering a functional PAH protein as mRNA formulated in LUNAR lipid nanoparticles to the PAH-deficient liver, restoring PAH function and reducing blood Phe to healthy levels. In a PKU mouse model, we have shown that we can deliver a functional human PAH mRNA and reduce Phe to safe levels (Phe < 0.3 mM), and do repeated dosing maintaining the same efficacy after each repeated dose. Presently, the program is aiming to increase the duration of the efficacy after a single dose treatment to reduce the frequency of dosing and improve the effectiveness of the therapy. Proof of concept studies in PKU mice show that engineering of PAH mRNA and protein lead to a significant increase in the duration of the efficacy, longer than three (3) days, as compared to the original PAH mRNA design (~24-48 hours) as shown in the figure below. Efficacy and tolerability in vivo studies are planned to nominate a candidate drug product and best PAH mRNA and LUNAR formulation.
 LUNAR PAH mRNA reduces Phe plasma levels in a PKU mouse model after a single dose.
 
Enabling Technologies
 Enabling Technologies – LUNAR-Genome Editing
Genome editing therapies are based on the ability to modify a specific DNA sequence in the human genome. All genome editing molecular tools can be programmed to target a DNA sequence of interest. Although the diversity of programmable gene editing tools is increasing, all of them are based on a DNA binding component (either a protein or, as in the case of CRISPR-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, an RNA sequence) plus a DNA modifier component (a protein that can either make double strand breaks on the DNA (nuclease), single strand breaks (nickase), or make chemical modification in the DNA (base editors)). One of the main roadblocks to applying genome editing as a therapy to treat human disease is the delivery of the genome editing tool components into the cells, either ex-vivo or in vivo, applying them directly into the human body and targeting the right organ.
The LUNAR-Genome editing program aims to leverage the ability of our LUNAR-mRNA technology to deliver any type of genome editing tools into target cells. Some of the genome editing tools are based on protein components working in pairs (TALEN-Transcriptional Activator-Like Effector Nuclease, ZFN-Zinc Finger Nuclease) or as a single protein (meganuclease), while other tools could have a combination of RNA and protein component (CRISPR). We have delivered mRNAs coding for TALEN proteins encapsulated in our LUNAR formulations acting on different targets, and also CRISPR Cas9 mRNA to edit the targeted DNA sequence.
 To test the efficacy of the different genome editing strategies as a proof of concept, we utilized target genes that encode proteins that are well known, that are involved in diseases and can be detected in the plasma, which facilitated the readout of the experiments. For evaluation of the LUNAR TALEN mRNA strategy, we designed TALEN pairs targeting either the mouse Pcsk9 gene or the human LPA gene which are involved in lipid metabolism and are associated with cardiovascular disease. The Pcsk9 gene is expressed only in the mouse liver, and the PCSK9 protein is then secreted into the blood circulation. PCSK9 binds and downregulates the LDL receptors present in the hepatocytes cell membrane, therefore reduction of PCSK9 protein levels increases LDLR (defined below) levels and its availability to take and reduce LDL-Cholesterol from the blood (Figure 1. Top). A single intravenous dose of LUNAR-TALEN PCSK9 mRNA into wildtype mice lead to insertions and deletions in the PCSK9 genomic DNA sequence. The edition of the PCSK9 genome sequence inactivated the PCSK9 gene and, consequently, there was a reduction of PCSK9 protein levels in the mouse plasma of the treated mice (Figure 1. Bottom Left). Examination of the targeted PCSK9 DNA sequence extracted from different organs did not show any DNA modifications except for the liver, which is explained by the liver specificity of this LUNAR formulation (Figure 1. Bottom Right).

Elimination of PCSK9 protein after editing the Pcsk9 target gene Bottom Left: LUNAR-PCSK9 TALEN mRNA dosing of mice at time Day 0 irreversibly reduces levels of PCSK9 in circulation. Bottom Right: Genome editing evaluation by sequencing shows INDEL (insertion/deletions) only in DNA extracted from the liver but not from other tissues.
 Lipoprotein(a), Lp(a), is a causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown an association between higher circulating Lp(a) concentrations and an increased risk of atherosclerotic and aortic calcification cardiovascular disease. Lipid-lowering drugs do not effectively reduce Lp(a) levels that are mainly regulated by the genomic structure of the apo(a) gene named LPA. LPA is expressed only in the liver and natural homozygous loss of this gene in humans has not been associated with adverse phenotypes, which makes the LPA a candidate for genome editing therapies. We designed and tested our LUNAR TALEN LPA technology in primary human hepatocytes and in a transgenic mouse model containing the human LPA gene. Like the PCSK9 model, a single dose of LUNAR TALEN LPA mRNA led to a significant reduction of LPA levels in serum that correlated with the reduction of Apo(a) mRNA expression and the presence of editing in the LPA target sequence.
LUNAR TALEN LPA mRNA reduces human Lp(a) plasma levels in a human Lp(a) transgenic mouse model after a single dose.
 
To test the ability to deliver CRISPR technology into the liver, we use a single guide RNA known to target the mouse Ttr gene. The transthyretin (TTR) protein is expressed only in the liver and is secreted into the blood circulation. In humans, mutations in the TTR gene can cause transthyretin amyloidosis. Mutations on the Ttr gene can alter the structure of the transthyretin protein impairing its normal function and leading to abnormal deposits of the TTR protein in different organs and tissues of the body, mainly in the nervous system and the heart. Reduction
of the TTR production could stop the progression of the disease (Fig. 2 Top). LUNAR formulations containing a mouse TTR-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) together with the Cas9 nuclease mRNA were injected intravenously into wildtype mice. After a single dose, there was a reduction in the amount of TTR protein detected in the mouse serum (Fig.2, Bottom left). This reduction of TTR protein correlated with the deletions detected in the targeted TTR genomic DNA extracted from the liver of the LUNAR TTR-CRISPR mRNA treated mice (Fig.2, Bottom right).

Figure 2. Top; TTR protein containing mutations aggregates and deposits forming amyloid fibers in different organs causing cardiomyopathies or neuropathies. Left: TTT levels in the serum was reduced in mice treated with LUNAR-CRISPR Cas9 and sgRNA TTR mRNA but not in mice treated with LUNAR Cas9 mRNA. Right. Genome editing evaluation by sequencing shows INDEL (insertion/deletions) only in the livers of the group of mice treated with LUNAR CRISPR Cas9 sgRNA TTR.
 Demonstration of efficacy of the LUNAR mRNA platform with different genome editing technologies and targets will enable future discovery efforts toward the identification of new potential therapies.
 Enabling Technologies – Cancer vaccines
Our LUNAR Cancer vaccine discovery efforts are aimed at developing an immunotherapy against a tumor via activated T-cells. The vaccine would encode an antigen that would be specifically presented by (or associated with) a tumor, such that the vaccination would elicit T cell responses that recognize and attack the tumor. We have applied our learnings from our more-advanced LUNAR-COVID-19 program to establish both STARR (self-amplifying) and conventional mRNA platforms for immuno-oncology therapy.
In a preclinical study, our proof of concept (POC) vaccine encoding AH1 antigen of gp70 protein which is highly expressed on the surface of mouse colorectal carcinoma cell line CT26 has demonstrated clear effectiveness in a syngeneic mouse model of a colorectal CT26 cell line. With intramuscular administration of the STARR vaccine (two doses of 10 ug), treated with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI), anti-PD1/PDL1 antibody, led to a drastic reduction of tumor growth in comparison to the CPI treatment by itself (Panel A). Moreover, the same level of efficacy was achieved with a single administration of a 0.2 ug dose of the STARR vaccine.

With various LUNAR® formulations, conventional mRNA vaccine expressing the AH1 antigen also demonstrated a robust T cell response (Panel B) and reduction of tumor growth with anti-PD1/PDL1 treatment in the syngeneic mouse model. We believe that these POC results from the two platforms hints for the possible applicability to various types of cancer with flexibility in dosing regimens.
Our current effort focuses on the selection of neoantigens and other tumor-specific antigens encoded in the cancer vaccines. These antigens can be shared among patients, and therefore have more target patient populations. Additional advancements of LUNAR Cancer Vaccine program include the improvement of antigen cassette designs, STARR RNA elements, and immune modulator molecules, all of which can significantly enhance T cell responses.

Enabling Technologies – Immuno-oncology
 Cell-based therapies for hematologic malignancies using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have made incredible advances in the past decade. The success of CAR-T cells in immuno-oncology has led to a growing number of therapies utilizing other immune cell types engineered to express a variety of immunomodulatory molecules. Yet, despite their promise, extensive challenges still exist with this therapeutic approach. Some of the issues include toxicity, potential for insertional mutagenesis of the CAR construct and an ex vivo manufacturing process that is complex, time consuming and costly. We believe that our LUNAR-I/O approach has the potential to ameliorate some of these issues. For example:
 1.RNA-driven CAR expression in lymphocytes or immune cell types would be transient and therefore expected to have a lower side effect profile;
2.There is no integration into the germline DNA allowing for co-delivery of multiple therapeutic molecules without the risk of insertional mutagenesis; and
3.Generation of CAR-expressing cells by a process that is quicker and cheaper, particularly when targeting specific immune cell subtypes in vivo.
 
The goal of the LUNAR-I/O program is to leverage the inherent advantages of both RNA and LUNAR technology to maximize clinical effectiveness of CAR-expressing cells. To this end, initial experiments have demonstrated that LUNAR lipid nanoparticles can transfect > 90% of both primary human CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes in vitro. Our current efforts are focused on targeting T lymphocytes in vivo with either CAR-mRNA or CAR-STARR (self-amplifying RNA) constructs in combination with other immunostimulatory molecules. We are currently expanding this technology to effectively target other lymphoid and myeloid lineage cell types with a variety of immunomodulatory molecules for oncological indications.


Platform Technology Overview

Our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology includes a diverse, growing library of over 250 proprietary lipids that we are rationally designing to be versatile, while maximizing efficacy and improving tolerability of a diverse selection of nucleic acids, refining the LNPs to target specific cell types, and determining the most favorable routes of administration. A key feature of our LUNAR lipids is their biodegradability, decreasing the undesired effects caused by lipid accumulation that are associated with tolerability issues present in other lipid-mediated RNA medicine delivery platforms. Our team continues to advance in the area of producing LUNAR lipid formulated nucleic acid product candidates in a scalable and highly reproducible manner, reducing the costs of goods for the therapies in our pipeline.
 In addition to our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology, we believe we have created innovative, proprietary advancements in producing mRNA medicines, including improvements that increase purity, scalability, efficiency in production times, and adaptability to different mRNA modification strategies. We strive to use these proprietary innovations to benefit each mRNA medicine in our pipeline.
 We continue to invest in our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery of mRNA (encoding CRISPR-Cas9, TALEN, zinc finger proteins, and meganucleases), siRNA, DNA, microRNA, and antisense oligonucleotide technology platforms to improve their efficacy and safety profile, further expanding their applications. This investment has led to key innovations ensuring that our LUNAR formulated drug product candidates have optimal characteristics for therapeutic use, which we believe sets us apart from other nucleic acid therapeutics and lipid-mediated delivery platforms. As such, we consider ourselves a leader in the research and development of systemically administered mRNA therapeutics.
 Key Attributes of Our LUNAR Lipid-Mediated Delivery Technology
We have designed our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery platform to address major challenges with nucleic acid medicine delivery, including transfection efficiency, adverse immune reactions and liver damage.
LUNAR formulations are a multi-component, lipid-mediated drug delivery system that utilizes our proprietary lipids, called ATX lipids. Each of our ATX lipids contain an ionizable head group and a biodegradable lipid backbone. The head group is a key chemical component of the ATX lipid, making it pH-sensitive and providing it distinct advantages as a component of our LUNAR lipid formulation. At acidic pH, ATX lipids are positively charged, facilitating interaction with the negatively charged nucleic acid, thereby enabling LUNAR particle formation. At physiological pH (e.g., pH 7.4),the ATX lipids within the LUNAR formulations are neutrally charged, reducing the toxicity often seen with permanently positively-charged lipid-mediated delivery technology. Upon uptake into a cell by endocytosis (a process that forms a cellular structure called an endosome around the LUNAR formulated nucleic acid therapeutic), the head group again becomes positively charged, disrupting the endosome and the LUNAR particle, resulting in release of the nucleic acid therapeutic into the cell where is it translated to produce a therapeutic protein.
The disruption of the LUNAR particle also releases the components of the formulation into the cell, where the ATX lipid is degraded by enzymes in the cell allowing for the lipids to be cleared from the cell. We designed the ATX lipid to be rapidly biodegradable by engineering chemical structural components, called esters, into the ATX backbone that are sensitive to cellular enzymes, called esterases. This degradation prevents ATX lipids from accumulating inside the cell and causing toxicity.
Biodegradable, highly optimized for each cell type

LUNAR-platform development
 The development of our LUNAR platform is focused on continuous innovation and advancement in the following areas:
•Design and incorporate novel ATX lipids and formulations to enrich our library of proprietary ATX lipids for target cell/tissue specificity, improved tolerability and translatability to larger species;
 •Develop and improvise manufacturing processes for LUNAR formulations to ensure RNA encapsulation across compositions and scales;
•Develop stabilization strategies (e.g. lyophilized presentation) for LUNAR formulations to mitigate frozen storage; and
•Continually assess and improvise LUNAR screening funnel to enable rigorous selection of ATX lipids for various programs.
 Through the above efforts, our versatile LUNAR platform continues to drive internal and partner programs.
ATX Lipid Design and In Vivo Screening Process
 As mentioned above, we have generated a growing library of more than 250 proprietary ATX lipids. ATX lipids are rationally designed to fit their respective applications and vary depending on the target cell type and route of administration. We perform extensive formulation screening for each nucleic acid therapeutic candidate to determine the optimal ATX lipid and LUNAR composition for the particular nucleic acid therapeutic candidate, the desired route of administration, and target cell type.
 The design of ATX lipids is an iterative process based on in vivo protein expression and tolerability results from previous ATX lipid candidates. New ATX lipids are chemically synthesized and used to package both siRNAs for inhibiting target protein expression and mRNAs expressing a secreted protein. The ATX lipid formulated RNAs must meet specific chemical and biophysical acceptance criteria before being tested for biological activity. RNA formulations meeting all acceptance criteria are first screened for protein expression in mice. Active candidates are then tested for tolerability and preliminary tissue clearance rates following administration. Active candidates are further verified by evaluating protein expression in non-human primates. Active ATX lipid candidates demonstrating high levels of protein expression and equivalent or improved tissue clearance rates are then assigned to a specific disease target for development of therapeutic applications. Results from a recent ATX lipid screening process is shown in the figure below.

As shown in the left figure above, mice were injected intravenously with LUNAR lipid formulations 21, 35,38, 39, 40 and 2 at a 0.3 mg/kg RNA dose. LUNAR lipid 2 formulation is a positive control to which expression from the other formulations is compared. Mice were bled 24 hours after injection and assayed for erythropoietin (EPO), a secreted protein. The left figure above shows the clearance of the LUNAR lipids from the liver 48 hours after administration of 0.1mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg RNA doses. LUNAR 35, 38, 39 and 40 yielded higher expression of EPO than LUNAR 2, the positive control, and LUNAR 21 yielded equivalent levels compared to LUNAR 2. The right figure above shows the clearance of lipid from the liver 48 hours after administration. No detectable ATX lipid was observed in the liver at the 0.1 mg/kg dose and only LUNAR 40 lipid showed any residual ATX lipid with a 0.3 mg/kg RNA dose which is approximately 1% to 2% of the administered lipid dose. In retrospect, the LUNAR 2 formulation, positive control, showed approximately 70% of residual lipid in the liver in the same time frame. Hence, this lipid screen identified 5 LUNAR lipids that yielded equivalent or greater RNA expression and were rapidly cleared from the liver within 48 hours after administration.
 Lung Targeting
Aerosol capabilities have been developed for the Cystic Fibrosis program using our proprietary lipid nanoparticle delivery platform, LUNAR®. Characterization and optimization of the aerosolized LUNAR® formulations in targeting airway epithelium have been achieved in rodent (mice, rat) and nonrodent models (ferret, NHP) as depicted in the image using a reporter mRNA encapsulated in LUNAR®. We expect that the validation attained for the inhaled LUNAR® platform in the Cystic Fibrosis program will serve as a “plug and play” approach to support other respiratory approaches where targeting airway epithelium is needed.


LUNAR® delivery to airways epithelium demonstrated in vivo across species (rodents, ferrets, NHPs)
 Liver Targeting
 As proof of concept for augmenting LUNAR liver-targeting capabilities, we are developing LUNAR formulations containing a propriety hepatocyte targeting agent. Traditional lipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery to hepatocytes occurs via uptake by the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). We evaluated this targeting agent in an LDLR-deficient mouse model and found that only the LUNAR formulations with this targeting agent were able to deliver mRNA to the hepatocytes compared to LUNAR formulations that did not contain the targeting agent. Based on these promising data, we are expanding these platform development efforts.

LUNAR Safety (i.v. administration)
 ARCT-810 Nonclinical Safety Profile
 Arcturus has instituted a robust ATX lipid screening paradigm to ensure that we identify formulations with suitable properties for the intended drug’s target product profile, whether is it a protein replacement therapy, a gene editing treatment, or a vaccine. Drug product safety is a key feature in that profile. A recent example of the outcome of these efforts is the nonclinical safety profile we obtained with ARCT-032 that has enabled the first-in-human trials.
 Our Proprietary mRNA and Protein Design Technology
The mRNA programs in our pipeline benefit from our in-house expertise in protein and mRNA design, which helps us address many of the known challenges that face the viability of mRNA therapeutics today. We have identified several design elements of mRNA compounds that provide improved translation (the process of making protein based on the instructions/codes in the mRNA) of our mRNA therapeutics, including untranslated regions derived from species that have not previously been combined with human mRNA sequences. This platform technology is applicable to many different human mRNA sequences that we are currently investigating in our discovery efforts. We are able to engineer human protein sequences to increase the half-life of the proteins produced by our mRNA therapies and can more efficiently direct specific types of proteins to certain cellular structures of interest. These innovations are broadly applicable to several programs that are part of our mRNA discovery efforts.
 In addition to these platform technologies, we have developed a proprietary tool to aid our team in the efficient design and development of new mRNA drug candidates. Our mRNA Design Suite is a cloud-based software suite with a collection of proprietary bioinformatic algorithms aimed at achieving highly improved potency of a drug substance through optimization of mRNA sequences. The algorithms were developed in house through the integration of experimentally validated optimization processes. Through multi-layered in silico quality control pipelines, mRNA Design Suite promptly generates high-quality and error-free sequences accompanied by various statistics. Additionally, mRNA Design Suite seamlessly interacts with our plasmid/mRNA production database to accelerate the process from mRNA design to gene synthesis, cloning, and mRNA production.
 Our STARR mRNA Technology
In addition to our LUNAR lipids technology, our platform technologies include our distinct and proprietary self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) platform, termed STARR. The STARR platform includes proprietary algorithms that
inform the design and optimization of saRNA to enhance expression of the applicable antigen while minimizing structures that might inhibit expression. The replicase, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is encoded upstream of the antigen of interest and functions to amplify transcripts and increase the duration of antigen expression compared to non-self-amplifying (conventional) mRNA. The enhanced expression leads to higher immunogenicity at lower doses than conventional mRNA vaccines in preclinical studies (Figure x).
 
The above results show the luciferase expression from an optimized saRNA, STARR Technology (Green), a non-optimized saRNA (Blue) and the conventional RNA (Purple). The STARR Technology yields at least a 30 fold greater expression level than conventional RNA. The STARR Technology also produces a longer duration of expression compared to the conventional RNA and also the non-optimized self-amplifying RNA.
 We believe the combination of LUNAR and STARR technology can provide lower dose requirements due to superior immune response and sustained protein expression as compared to non-self-amplifying RNA-based vaccines. We believe this LUNAR/STARR technology will enable us to simplify and increase the speed of vaccine production.
 Supply and Manufacturing
Our supply and manufacturing strategies are focused on addressing the following considerations:
1.multiple pre-clinical & clinical pipeline candidates;
 2.late-stage clinical and commercial scale COVID vaccine products; and
 3.regional and global product demand. 
 We have built a global manufacturing footprint with our partners, including Aldevron, Catalent, Recipharm, Polymun and Arcalis. With such collaborations we have established an Integrated Global Supply Chain Network with our primary and secondary sourcing contract development & manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) based in the United States, EU and Asia for producing critical raw materials, drug substance, and packaged finished product. We expect our current manufacturing capabilities, qualified sourcing sites, and ongoing global technology transfers to enable, by the end of 2023, a forecasted capacity of more than 200 million doses annually for stockpiling and commercialization of COVID vaccine.
To date, we have manufactured and supplied gram quantities of drug substance, and scaled-up and validated our finished drug products (COVID Vaccine) through our CDMOs for clinical studies, EUA, stockpiling and commercial readiness. We have developed, and continue to dedicate, resources to advance our sophisticated manufacturing know-how, including formulation of lipid nanoparticles, which improves manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Additionally, we are strategically exploring options to build our internal USA-based manufacturing capabilities for entire drug substance, drug product and finished product.
Global Manufacturing Footprint


For the near future, we expect to continue to rely on third-party CDMOs for the supply of drug substance and finished drug product for our current product candidates, including to support the launch of our first commercial product.
 Our CDMOs are compliant with CGMPs and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We believe we have established sufficient manufacturing capacity through our CDMOs to meet our current internal research, development, and potential commercial needs, as well as our obligations under existing agreements with our partners. Additionally, we continue to evaluate relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity and diversify our supply chain.
 Revenue and Collaboration Arrangements and Other Material Agreements
 In addition to our internal programs, we have a number of strategic alliances where we collaborate with other parties on discovery, development, manufacturing or other efforts based on our LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery system and our proprietary mRNA and protein design technologies. Among other collaboration arrangements,
 •we have a collaboration with CSL Seqirus for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), influenza and three other respiratory infectious diseases;
 •we are partnering with Ultragenyx to develop mRNA therapeutic candidates for rare disease targets; 
•we have received funding from the CFF to support our LUNAR-CF development program;
•we have a contract with BARDA to support the development of a low-dose pandemic influenza candidate based on our proprietary self-amplifying messenger RNA-based vaccine platform; and
 •we are partnering with Curevac N.V. (“CureVac”) to develop mRNA therapeutic candidates for rare disease targets.
 CSL Seqirus
 In November 2022, we entered into the CSL Collaboration Agreement with Seqirus, Inc. (“CSL Seqirus”), a part of CSL Limited, one of the world’s leading influenza vaccine providers, for the global exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize self-amplifying mRNA vaccines. The CSL Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 8, 2022, following clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
Under CSL Collaboration Agreement, CSL Seqirus receives global exclusive rights to our technology for vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), influenza and three other respiratory infectious diseases. Specifically, the collaboration agreement grants CSL Seqirus a license to our STARR mRNA technology and LUNAR® lipid-mediated delivery, as well as mRNA drug substance and drug product manufacturing expertise. CSL has also been granted global non-exclusive rights in the field of pandemic preparedness (i.e., pathogens identified as priority diseases by the WHO), with the right to convert to an exclusive license.
We received an up-front payment of $200.0 million. We are eligible to potentially receive development milestones totaling more than $1.3 billion if all products are registered in the licensed fields. We also are entitled to potentially receive up to $3.0 billion in commercial milestones based on “net sales” of vaccines in the various fields. In addition, we are entitled to receive a 40% share of net profits from COVID-19 vaccine sales and up to low double-digit royalties of annual net sales for vaccines against influenza and the other three specified infectious disease pathogens, as well as royalties on revenues from vaccines that may be developed for pandemic preparedness. Entitlement to all such payments is subject to the strict conditions, requirements, royalty reduction provisions and other limitations set forth in the CSL Collaboration Agreement.
In March 2023, Arcturus achieved development milestones, including milestones associated with nominating next generation vaccine candidates, resulting in $90.0 million due from CSL Seqirus.
 The CSL Collaboration Agreement sets forth how the parties will collaborate to research and develop vaccine candidates. In the COVID-19 field, we will lead activities for certain regulatory filings for our leading self-amplifying mRNA vaccine candidate in COVID-19, ARCT-154, in the United States and Europe and for research and development activities of a next-generation COVID vaccine candidate. CSL Seqirus will lead and be responsible for all other research and development in COVID-19, influenza and the other fields.
Either party may terminate the CSL Collaboration Agreement on a field-by-field basis for material breach by the other party, following notice and opportunity to cure. CSL Seqirus may also terminate the collaboration agreement in its entirety or on a field-by-field basis for any reason or no reason whatsoever, with certain limitations. The CSL Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by CSL Seqirus for safety reasons, clinical data nonviability, commercial nonviability and other specified reasons.
The CSL Collaboration Agreement allows us to fulfill our obligations under the award from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) relating to rapid pandemic influenza response, announced by Arcturus in August 2022.
 Ultragenyx
 On October 26, 2015, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Ultragenyx, which was later amended in 2017, 2018 and during the second quarter of 2019 (as amended, the “Ultragenyx Agreement”). Ultragenyx initially selected two development targets, including Glycogen Storage Disease Type III, and the parties initially agreed to a list of eight additional reserved rare disease targets which Ultragenyx has an exclusive option to select for collaborative development. Under the Ultragenyx Agreement, we have granted Ultragenyx exclusivity (i) with respect to development targets, to the development and commercialization of products containing nucleic acid technology, and (ii) with respect to reserved targets, the development and commercialization of any product containing nucleic acid products or utilizing LUNAR lipid-mediated delivery technology.
 Under the Ultragenyx Agreement, we have granted Ultragenyx a co-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license of our technology for conducting collaborative development of development targets, compounds and products.
On June 18, 2019, we expanded our collaboration with Ultragenyx and entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Ultragenyx Agreement. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the total number of targets was increased from 10 to 12, and we granted Ultragenyx exclusivity to development targets for four years at no additional cost. In connection with the Third Amendment, Ultragenyx purchased shares of our common stock and made a one-time upfront payment. Ultragenyx also received a two-year option to purchase additional shares of our common stock which they exercised in May of 2020.
 On December 1, 2021, Ultragenyx announced that the first patient had been dosed in its Phase 1/2 study of UX053, an investigational messenger RNA therapy in development under the collaboration for the treatment of Glycogen Storage Disease Type III, and thus the first milestone under the collaboration agreement had been met.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Agreement
 On May 16, 2017, pursuant to a Development Program Letter Agreement (the “CFF Agreement”), CFF agreed to award us funding for a development program to identify lead CFTR mRNA sequences and LUNAR formulations, demonstrate tolerability of LUNAR CFTR mRNA, and demonstrate translatability of aerosolized LUNAR (the “CFF Agreement”). The award includes a grant of rights to CFF know-how to assist us to research, develop, commercialize, make or otherwise exploit a product. If the award results in a successful commercialized product, we will pay CFF (i) royalties on sales of the product up to a maximum of a single-digit multiple of the total award amount actually paid to us by CFF, and (ii) thereafter, a single-digit percentage of annual net sales. Further, in the event of a license, sale or other transfer of the product or our development program technology (including a change of control transaction), we will pay CFF a percentage of such license, sale or transfer payments actually received by us or our shareholders (subject to a royalty cap).
On August 1, 2019, we amended the CFF Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, (i) CFF will increase the amount it will award to advance LUNAR-CF, (ii) we will provide a certain amount of matching funds for remaining budgeted costs, and (iii) the related disbursement schedule from CFF to us was modified such that (a) a disbursement was made upon execution of the amendment, (b) an agreed upon amount will be disbursed to us within thirty days of the first day of each of January, April, July and October 2020, and (c) the last payment will be disbursed upon us invoicing CFF to meet good manufacturing practices and submitting an IND application. In January 2022, the parties signed an additional amendment for CFF to fund the development of a CF ferret model for application in the development of ARCT-032, our LUNAR-CF candidate.
BARDA
 In August 2022, we entered into a cost reimbursement contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support the development of a low-dose pandemic influenza candidate based on our proprietary self-amplifying messenger RNA-based vaccine platform.
The contract is to support our non-clinical and pre-clinical development, early-stage clinical development through Phase 1, and associated drug product manufacturing, regulatory and quality-assurance activities over a period of three years. The contract provides for reimbursement by BARDA of Arcturus’ permitted costs incorporated into the contract, up to $63.2 million. The contract does not include the purchase of any pandemic influenza vaccine that eventually may be developed. The contract is terminable by BARDA at any time under specified circumstances, including for convenience.
This contract is part of BARDA’s ongoing efforts to bolster pandemic preparedness and response capabilities by investing in innovative medical counter-measures that can help prevent the medical consequences that result from outbreaks caused by pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.
CureVac
 On January 1, 2018, we entered into a Development and Option Agreement with CureVac, which was amended on May 3, 2018 and later restated on September 28, 2018 (as amended and restated, the “Development and Option Agreement”). Under the terms of the Development and Option Agreement, CureVac and Arcturus agreed to conduct joint preclinical development programs and we granted CureVac a license to develop and commercialize certain products incorporating certain of our technology (the “Arcturus LMD Technology”) and CureVac technology. The products subject to the Development and Option Agreement relate to certain targets to be identified during the eight year term of the agreement. In consideration for the rights granted under the Development and Option Agreement, we received an upfront fee from CureVac.
 Prior to expiration of the initial term of eight years (which was subsequently amended, as discussed below), the Development and Option Agreement also includes an option to extend the term on an annual basis for up to three years, subject to payment by CureVac to Arcturus of a non-refundable annual extension fee. The Development and Option Agreement includes potential milestone payments from CureVac for selected targets. Additionally, CureVac will pay royalties as a percentage of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis during the applicable royalty term in the low single-digit range.
 On July 26, 2019, we entered into an amendment (“CureVac Amendment”) to the Development and Option Agreement, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to shorten the time period during which CureVac may select
potential targets to be licensed from eight years to four years from the date of the CureVac Amendment, and to reduce the overall number of maximum targets that may be reserved and licensed.
 Other Material Agreements
Alexion License Agreement
 On February 17, 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Alexion”) pursuant to which Alexion granted to Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. an exclusive, worldwide license to exploit certain specified Alexion patents. In accordance with the terms of the license agreement, and in exchange for the license, we issued shares of our common stock to Alexion. The per share price was determined based on the volume weighted average closing price of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market for the thirty trading days ending on February 17, 2021.
Intellectual Property
 Our business success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our proprietary technologies, inventions and know-how, and on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We strive to protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, licensing agreements, invention assignment agreements and confidentiality agreements with employees, advisors, consultants and contractors.
 We rely on continuing technological innovation to strengthen our proprietary position in the field of nucleic acid medicines. Therefore, we plan to continue to file patent applications in jurisdictions around the world as we discover and develop novel nucleic acid technology platforms and novel nucleic acid therapeutic candidates. We cannot guarantee that future applications will be issued.
 Our Patent Portfolio
 As of March 24, 2023, we own over 305 patents and pending patent applications including 41 U.S. patents, 33 pending U.S. patent applications, 10 pending international applications under Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”), 100 foreign patents and 121 pending foreign patent applications. The claims of these patents and pending applications include compositions of matter, methods of use, manufacturing process and drug product formulations. These claims cover the use of our core platform technologies including the use of LUNAR and lipid components to deliver nucleic acids, the use of UNA oligomers for therapeutics and reagents, the use of LNA oligomers for therapeutics, specific nucleic acid modalities for treating disease, as well as our proprietary technology regarding the design, manufacture, and purification of nucleic acids for use in therapy. Claims also cover the composition of matter, formulation, and use of our therapeutic candidates to prevent and/or treat target diseases including OTC deficiency, CF, HBV, and COVID-19. Our issued patents are expected to expire between 2028 and 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term extensions.
 Our patent portfolio includes the following patents and pending patent applications for LUNAR, UNA and the use of LNA in certain RNA medicines:
 •LUNAR – As of March 24, 2023, we own 19 U.S. patents, 12 U.S. pending patent applications, 4 international patent application (“PCT”), 29 foreign granted patents, and 61 foreign pending patent applications covering the composition of matter, manufacture of lipid nanoparticles (including lyophilization), and use of our LUNAR technology for nucleic acid delivery and drug delivery.
 
•UNA, mRNA and LNA – As of March 24, 2023, we own 22 U.S. patents, 10 U.S. pending patent applications, 3 PCT applications, 71 foreign patents and 31 foreign pending patent applications covering methods and uses of LNA, UNA oligomer and mRNA therapeutics, and compositions of UNA oligomers or mRNA to treat specific target diseases.
 
•STARR – In 2019, we began to develop our STARR platform which combines our proprietary LUNAR delivery systems with technologies that enable self-transcribing and self-amplifying RNA. As noted above, our robust LUNAR portfolio of over 149 patents and patent applications, provides protection for delivery vehicles that can enable specific and effective delivery of STARR drug substances. In particular, we own one pending U.S. provisional application, three pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications and one pending PCT application directed to the manufacture of 

compositions that can comprise STARR RNA in a lipid delivery vehicle. In addition, we have begun to develop our STARR patent portfolio, and as of March 24, 2023, we own four pending U.S. patent applications, and one pending PCT application directed to specially designed RNA constructs, specific nucleotide and amino acid sequences, and lipid formulations comprising the same under the STARR technology. We anticipate that further patents will be filed as we continue to innovate with respect to our STARR platform and that current applications covering these developments in our STARR platform, if granted, will last until 2044, not including any patent term extensions.
Patent Terms
 The term of individual patents depends on the countries in which they are obtained. The patent term is 20 years from the earliest effective date of filing a non-provisional patent application in most of the countries in which we file.
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act), U.S. patent holders can apply for a patent term extension to compensate for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent extension is only available for patents covering FDA-approved drugs. The extension can be up to five years beyond the original expiration date of the patent and cannot extend a patent term for longer than 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent extension is granted per approved drug. Similar provisions may be available in foreign jurisdictions including Europe. We intend to apply for patent term extensions where possible.
 Trade Secrets
 We also rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates and proprietary processes. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see Item 1A “Risk Factors” – “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Our success depends in part on our ability to:
 •preserve trade secrets;
 
•prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights; and
 
•operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties, both in the United States and internationally.
 Certain Risks to Intellectual Property 
 We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Product Approval and Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any product candidate that we develop must be authorized or approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the development, manufacturing, and marketing of human drugs and vaccines are subject to extensive regulation. The FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations, and biological products, including vaccines, under provisions of the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). Drugs and vaccines are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation and stability studies according to good laboratory practices (“GLP”) or other applicable regulations; 
 
•submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as current good clinical practices (“GCPs”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
 
•submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”) or biologics license application (“BLA”) for a new drug or biologics; 
 
•satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to ensure compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice standards (“cGMP”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 
•potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and 
 
•FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
 The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical study stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and pharmacological activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s direct control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the good clinical practices requirements. Further, each clinical
trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and provides oversight for the clinical trial until completed.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients;
 
•Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule; and 
 
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, a well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial is required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.
 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. review and approval processes
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees ($3,242,063 for 2023); a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless
otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
The FDA reviews all NDAs or BLAs submitted to determine if they are substantially complete before it accepts them for filing. If the FDA determines that an NDA or BLA is incomplete or is found to be non-navigable, the filing may be refused and must be re-submitted for consideration. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has 10 months from acceptance of filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from acceptance of filing for a priority NDA or BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months or longer if the FDA requests or the NDA or BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission before the PDUFA goal date.
After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA requires vaccine manufacturers to submit data supporting the demonstration of consistency between manufacturing batches, or lots. The FDA works together with vaccine manufacturers to develop a lot release protocol, the tests conducted on each lot of vaccine post-approval. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
The NDA or BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either submit new information, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, which are designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”)

The Commissioner of the FDA, under delegated authority from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) may, under certain circumstances, issue an authorization in the form of an EUA that would permit, for the duration of the declaration by the DHHS described below or until revocation of the EUA, the distribution and use of a drug or biological product that is not approved or licensed. Before an EUA may be issued, the Secretary must make a declaration that circumstances exist to justify the authorization based on one of the following grounds:
 •a determination by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security that there is a domestic emergency, or a significant potential for a domestic emergency, involving a heightened risk of attack with a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents;
 •a determination by the Secretary of the Department of Defense that there is a military emergency, or a significant potential for a military emergency, involving a heightened risk to U.S. military forces of attack with a specified biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents or other agent or agents that may cause, or are otherwise associated with, an imminently life-threatening and specific risk to U.S. military forces; 
 •a determination by the Secretary of the DHHS that there is a public health emergency, or significant potential for such, that affects, or has the significant potential to affect, national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad, and that involves a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents, or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent or agent; or
 •the identification of a material threat pursuant to Section 319F-2 of the Public Health Service Act, authorizing the creation of the Strategic National Stockpile and security countermeasure procurements, sufficient to affect the national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad. 
 In order to be the subject of an EUA, the FDA Commissioner must conclude that, based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating or preventing a disease attributable to the agents described above, that the product’s potential benefits outweigh its potential risks and that there is no adequate approved alternative to the product. The FDA has issued EUAs to companies for products intended for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The FDA expects EUA holders to work toward submission of an NDA, BLA, or other applicable approval.
 In addition to the United States, other countries such as UK and Vietnam have a similar mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies.
 Post-approval requirements
Any drug or biological products for which we or our strategic alliance partners receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
Manufacturers of our product candidates are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Following approval, the FDA continues to monitor vaccine quality through real-time monitoring of lots by requiring manufacturers to submit certain information for each vaccine lot. Vaccine manufacturers may only distribute a lot following release by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in
restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process require notice to or prior approval from the FDA before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Regulation in Europe and Other Regions
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our strategic alliance partners are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we or our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we or our strategic alliance partners must submit a marketing authorization application. The application in the EU is similar to that required in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, region/country-specific document requirements.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The regulatory approval of marketing authorization application of an investigational drug or biological product is similar to that required in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
Competition
 Our Business in General
 We believe that our scientific knowledge and expertise in nucleic acid-based therapies provide us with competitive advantages over the various companies and other entities that are attempting to develop similar treatments. However, we face competition at the technology platform and therapeutic indication levels from both large and small biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our recent collaboration with CSL, a global leader in vaccines, will allow us to compete better on the world stage within the COVID and influenza markets.
 Our success will be based in part upon our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of product candidates that are safer and more effective than competing products in the treatment of our targeted patients. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products we may develop.
We are aware of several other companies that are working to develop nucleic acid medicines, including gene therapy, gene editing, mRNA (including saRNA), siRNA, and antisense therapeutics. Many of these companies, such as Genevant, are also developing nucleic acid delivery platforms which compete with LUNAR technology.

Below we have included what we believe to be the competitive landscape for certain of the medicines that we currently have in development.
 Vaccine Franchise
LUNAR-COV19 Vaccines (ARCT-154)
 Our vaccine franchise is based on our self-amplifying and self-replicating STARR® technology platform and our lipid nanoparticle delivery platform called LUNAR®. This franchise has advanced into late stage clinical development including ARCT-154 in two Phase 3 clinical studies. We have partnered our COVID-19 vaccine franchise with CSL Seqirus. We consider the following companies with approved or late stage clinical development vaccines as some of our competitors or future competitors to our partnered COVID-19 vaccine franchise: Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen, AstraZeneca, Novavax, and HDT Bio. Dozens of other companies are continuing to develop COVID-19 vaccines. However, the majority of these companies use conventional mRNA (not self-amplifying) and egg-based vaccine technology as the basis for their COVID-19 vaccines.
 LUNAR-FLU Vaccine
 We have partnered our influenza vaccine franchise with CSL Seqirus. We consider the following companies as some of the competitors or future competitors to our partnered LUNAR-Flu vaccine franchise: Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna, and Sanofi. The flu industry is rapidly shifting to utilizing mRNA based platforms in addition to traditional (egg-based) technologies.
 Liver Franchise ARCT-810 (LUNAR-OTC)
 Our liver franchise has advanced into mid-stage clinical development with ARCT-810 in phase 2 clinical development. Potential competitors include, but are not limited to, Ultragenyx which is advancing a gene therapy program for OTC in clinical development, and Moderna which has a therapeutic candidate in pre-clinical development.
Lung Franchise: ARCT-032 (LUNAR-CF)
 The lead candidate of our lung franchise is ARCT-032, which is an mRNA therapeutic candidate for cystic fibrosis based on our proprietary drug substance mRNA technology platform and our LUNAR lipid nanoparticle delivery platform.
 We are aware of product candidates of the following companies that we consider as competitors or future competitors to ARCT-032: Moderna/Vertex, Eloxx Pharmaceuticals, Recode, 4DMT, Spirovant, SalioGen and Splisense.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 170 employees, all of which were full-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
