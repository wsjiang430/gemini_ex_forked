Unless otherwise noted, references to years are to fiscal years.
 
We are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse commercial and industrial markets. We have 9 operating business units, aggregated and organized for reporting purposes into five segments: Food Service Equipment, Engraving, Engineering Technologies, Electronics and Hydraulics. Overall management, strategic development and financial control are led by the executive staff at our corporate headquarters in Salem, New Hampshire.
 
Our long-term strategy is to enhance shareholder value by building larger, more profitable industrial platforms through a value creation system that assists management in meeting specific corporate and business unit financial and strategic performance goals in order to create, improve, and enhance shareholder value. The Standex Value Creation System is a standard methodology which provides consistent tools used throughout the company in order to achieve our organization’s goals. The Standex Value Creation System employs four components: Balanced Performance Plan, Standex Growth Disciplines, Standex Operational Excellence, and Standex Talent Management. The Balanced Performance Plan process aligns annual goals throughout the business and provides a standard reporting, management and review process. It is focused on setting and meeting annual and quarterly targets that support our short and long-term goals. The Standex Growth Disciplines use a set of tools and processes including market maps, growth laneways, and market tests to identify opportunities to expand the business organically and through acquisitions. Standex Operational Excellence employs a standard playbook and processes, including LEAN, to eliminate waste and improve profitability, cash flow and customer satisfaction. Finally, the Standex Talent Management process is an organizational development process that provides training, development, and succession planning for our employees throughout our worldwide organization.

● | It is our objective to grow larger and more profitable business units through both organic initiatives and acquisitions. We seek to identify and implement organic growth initiatives such as new product development, geographic expansion, introduction of products and technologies into new markets and applications, key accounts and strategic sales channel partners. Also, we have a long-term objective to create sizable business platforms by adding strategically aligned or “bolt on” acquisitions to strengthen the individual businesses, create both sales and cost synergies with our core business platforms, and accelerate their growth and margin improvement. We look to drive continuous improvement within our core business platforms, accelerate growth and improve margins. We have a particular focus on identifying and investing in opportunities that complement our products and will increase the global presence and capabilities of our businesses. From time to time, we have divested, and likely will continue to divest, businesses that we feel are not strategic or do not meet our growth and return expectations.

● | We create “Customer Intimacy” by collaborating with our customers in order to develop and deliver custom solutions or engineered components that solve problems for our customers or otherwise meet their needs. This relationship generally provides us with the ability to identify new sales opportunities with our customers, increase profit over time and provide operating margins that enhance shareholder returns. Further, we have made a priority of developing new sales channels and leveraging strategic customer relationships.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Standex Operational Excellence drives continuous improvement in the efficiency of our businesses. We recognize that our businesses are competing in a global economy that requires us to improve our competitive position. We have deployed a number of management competencies to drive improvements in the cost structure of our business units including operational excellence through lean enterprise, the use of low cost manufacturing facilities in countries such as Mexico and China, the consolidation of manufacturing facilities to achieve economies of scale and leveraging of fixed infrastructure costs, alternate sourcing to achieve procurement cost reductions, and capital improvements to increase productivity in both the shop floor and back-office.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company’s strong historical cash flow has been a cornerstone for funding our capital allocation strategy. We use cash flow generated from operations to fund the strategic growth programs described above, including acquisitions and investments for organic growth, maintenance of our capital assets and to return cash to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and stock buybacks.
