Overview

We are a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative antibody therapeutics. Our pipeline of full-length, human, multispecific antibody candidates is generated from our proprietary technology platforms, which are able to generate a diverse array of antibody binding domains, or Fabs, against virtually any target. Each antibody binding domain consists of a target-specific heavy chain paired with a common light chain. Multiple binding domains can be combined to produce novel multispecific antibodies that bind to a wide range of targets and display novel and innovative biology. These platforms, referred to as Biclonics® and Triclonics®, allow us to generate large numbers of diverse panels of bispecific and trispecific antibodies, respectively, which can then be functionally screened in large-scale cell-based assays to identify those unique molecules that possess novel biology, which we believe are best suited for a given therapeutic application. Further, by binding to multiple targets, Biclonics® and Triclonics® may be designed to provide a variety of mechanisms of action, including simultaneously blocking receptors that drive tumor cell growth and survival and mobilizing the patient’s immune response by engaging T cells, and/or activating various killer cells to eradicate tumors.
 Our technology platforms employ an assortment of patented technologies and techniques to generate human antibodies. We utilize our patented MeMo® mouse to produce a host of antibodies with diverse heavy chains and a common light chain that are capable of binding to virtually any antigen target. We use our patented heavy chain and CH3 domain dimerization technology to generate substantially pure bispecific and trispecific antibodies. We also employ our patented Spleen to Screen® technology to efficiently screen panels of diverse heavy chains, designed to allow us to more rapidly identify Biclonics® and Triclonics® therapeutic candidates with differentiated modes of action for pre-clinical and clinical testing.
Using our Biclonics® platform we have produced, and are currently developing, the following candidates: MCLA-128 (zenocutuzumab or Zeno) for the potential treatment of solid tumors that harbor Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) gene fusions and Zeno in combination with an androgen deprivation therapy for the potential treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); MCLA-158 (petosemtamab) for the potential treatment of solid tumors; MCLA-129, for the potential treatment of lung and other solid tumors; and MCLA-145 for the potential treatment of solid tumors. Furthermore, we have a pipeline of proprietary antibody candidates in pre-clinical development and intend to further leverage our Biclonics® and Triclonics® technology platforms to identify multiple additional antibody candidates and advance them to clinical development.
Our Strategy

Our goal is to become a leading oncology company developing innovative multispecific antibodies to treat various types of cancer. Our business strategy comprises the following components:
 
•Successfully develop our most advanced bispecific antibody candidate, zenocutuzumab, for the treatment of NRG1 fusion solid tumors, and explore other potential indications in non-NRG1 fusion cancers by targeting both HER2 and HER3. We are developing our most advanced bispecific antibody candidate, zenocutuzumab, for the potential treatment of solid tumors that contain NRG1 gene fusions. The NRG1 protein is the ligand for the HER3 receptor—a known cause of cancer cell growth. The gene encoding NRG1 can form genetic rearrangements referred to as NRG1 gene fusions. The protein product of the NRG1 gene fusion can drive signaling through the HER3 receptor and thus drive cancer cell growth. NRG1 gene fusions (NRG1+) occur infrequently in a wide range of different cancer types. Zenocutuzumab has been shown pre-clinically to potently disrupt binding of NRG1 (and NRG1-fusion proteins) to HER3 and halt NRG1-stimulated tumor cell growth. In July 2020, the FDA granted zenocutuzumab orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer and in January 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to zenocutuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors harboring NRG1 gene fusions that have progressed on standard-of-care therapy. We plan to provide an update on the potential registrational path and timeline in NRG1+ cancer in the first half of 2023 and a clinical update on zenocutuzumab in NRG1+ cancer at a major medical conference in 2023. Further, we are evaluating a cohort exploring the combination of zenocutuzumab with enzalutamide or abiraterone, an androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and we plan to provide an initial clinical data update on zenocutuzumab in CRPC in the second half of 2023. Further, we are evaluating a cohort exploring the combination of zenocutuzumab and afatinib for patients with NRG1+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
 

•Successfully develop our bispecific antibody candidate MCLA-158, petosemtamab. We are developing petosemtamab for a potential dual EGFR/LRG5 blockade for the treatment of solid tumors. Our phase 1 clinical trial of petosemtamab is ongoing in the dose expansion phase. In October 2021, we presented interim clinical data in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Virtual International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. As of the safety and efficacy data cutoff date of August 9, 2021, 10 patients with advanced HNSCC were enrolled and seven were evaluable for an interim efficacy analysis by investigator assessment. Three of seven patients achieved partial responses, with one of these three achieving complete response after the data cutoff date. Tumor reduction was observed in all seven patients. Enrollment of patients continues at this dose in the expansion phase of the open-label, multicenter trial. We plan to provide a clinical update in the first half of 2023 at a medical conference and plan to provide a regulatory path update in the first half of 2023.
 
•Successfully develop our bispecific antibody candidate MCLA-129. We are developing MCLA-129 as a potential treatment for solid tumors, including NSCLC. In May 2021, we announced that the first patient was treated in the phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating MCLA-129 for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and other solid tumors. The MCLA-129 trial is ongoing in the dose expansion phase, treating patients with MCLA-129 monotherapy in c-MET exon 14 mutant (mt) NSCLC, exon 20 insertion (EGFRex20) NSCLC, HNSCC, as well as in combination with Tagrisso (osimertinib) a third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in treatment naive EGFRmt NSCLC and in patients with EGFRmt NSCLC that have progressed on Tagrisso. We plan to provide an initial clinical data update from the expansion cohorts, and a further clinical development strategy update in the second half of 2023. MCLA-129 is subject to a collaboration and license agreement between Merus and Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta), whereby Merus exclusively licensed Betta to develop MCLA-129 in China, while Merus retains full ex-China rights. 
 
•Successfully develop our bispecific antibody candidate MCLA-145. We are developing MCLA-145 in an ongoing phase 1 trial for the potential treatment of solid tumors. MCLA-145 is designed to recruit, activate and prevent the exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T-cells. The trial consists of a dose escalation phase, followed by a planned dose expansion phase. In December 2021, we presented interim clinical data on MCLA-145 from the phase 1 trial dose escalation study in patients with solid tumors at the ESMO Immuno-Oncology Congress 2021. As of the data cutoff date of July 14, 2021, 34 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors had been treated at eight dose levels ranging from 0.4-75mg every two weeks. Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity was observed at doses ≥25 mg biweekly. We have also initiated a cohort combining MCLA-145 with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) a PD-1 blocking antibody, with enrollment on-going.
 
•Accelerate the discovery and development of additional internal and collaboration-related bispecific antibody candidates and internal trispecific antibody candidates. We believe we are well positioned to expand our pipeline of Biclonics® and Triclonics® molecules for the potential treatment of cancer and potentially other forms of disease. We are conducting pre-clinical studies for our internal proprietary bispecific and trispecific pipeline as well as leveraging our bispecific platform with our collaborators including Incyte, Eli Lilly and Company (Eli Lilly) and Betta.
 
•Seek strategic collaborations. We intend to seek strategic collaborations to facilitate the capital-efficient development of our pipeline and to maximize the value of our Biclonics® and Triclonics® technology platforms and to access unique partner capabilities and capacity. We have entered into collaborations with Incyte, Eli Lilly, and Betta to develop bispecific antibody candidates based on our Biclonics® technology platform. We plan to work with other potential future collaborators to further validate and expand the use of our Biclonics® and Triclonics® platforms in developing bispecific and trispecific antibody candidates. We have also worked with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., under a research license agreement to generate bispecific antibodies, including for indications in and outside oncology, which further underscore the breadth of the Merus platform. We believe these collaborations, license and future agreements could potentially provide significant funding to advance our pipeline and allow us to benefit from the additional resources, development and commercialization expertise of our collaborators. 
 

Our Biclonics® and Triclonics® Candidate Portfolio
We currently have bispecific candidates in clinical development, with a variety bispecific and trispecific candidates in pre-clinical development. The following table summarizes our development candidate pipeline:
Cancer Immunotherapeutics
Immunotherapy is a relatively new class of cancer treatment that works to harness a patient’s own immune system to attack the cancer cells. There are a number of immunotherapies that are designed to engage various aspects of the immune system, for example: (1) adaptive immunity, specifically directing genetically modified T cells to the tumor with chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR T cells or T-cell receptor modification; or modulating T-cell activity through co-stimulation or checkpoint signals; and (2) innate immunity, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), cellular-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), monocyte/macrophage cytotoxicity, natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity, or other forms of T-cell cytotoxicity; all directed at the cancer cells. While these therapies vary in mechanism of action, they rely on specific components of the innate or adaptive immune system to kill tumor cells or counteract signals produced by cancer cells that suppress immune responses.
 While these approaches have advanced the field of oncology, each also have limitations. For example, the enhanced ADCC of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a single target expressed by tumor cells can potentially induce an autoimmune “on-target, off-tumor” toxicity to normal non-tumor tissues that may also express the same target antigen. Cell-based therapies such as genetically modified CAR-T cells can be difficult and expensive to manufacture, can persist in patients for many months, can be associated with a toxic cytokine release syndrome as safety concerns, or can become ineffective if the tumor loses expression of the single antigen against which the CAR-T cells are directed. We believe multispecific antibody candidates developed from our novel platforms offer the potential to overcome these limitations.
 
Background on Antibodies
The conventional antibody in full length immunoglobulin G (IgG) format is a Y-shaped molecule that consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, as shown in the figure below. Each heavy chain pairs with the light chain to form two variable regions, or antigen binding fragment, Fab, that bind to antigens, or targets, and a constant region, which includes a region known as the fragment crystallizable (Fc) that binds to receptors present on effector cells in the immune system. In conventional full-length IgG, the variable regions are identical and bind to the same targets.
 




In multispecific antibodies, the two or more variable regions bind to two or more different targets. To achieve this in the full-length IgG format, different heavy chain variable regions that can use a common light chain are combined. In addition, modifications of the heavy chain Fc regions are engineered to drive the formation of full-length IgG that use two different heavy chains rather that two copies of the same heavy chain, which make a monospecific antibody.
 In both conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and IgG multispecific antibodies, the Fc region can bind to Fc receptors present on effector cells. This binding results in the recruitment and activation of immune effector cells and amplifies the immune system’s response to antigens bound by the variable region of the antibody. This process is called ADCC. The Fc region can be modified to enhance ADCC so as to generate a more potent immune response against a particular target. The Fc region can also be silenced to block interactions with the immune system.
 
Our Biclonics® and Triclonics® Platforms

Our two technology platforms use large-scale functional screening in molecular and cell-based assays to identify novel, innovative Biclonics® and Triclonics® with the specific characteristics desired for further development.
 
We believe our Biclonics® and Triclonics® platforms allow us to approach cancer treatment through multiple innovative modes of action:
 
•Blocking oncogenic growth factor signaling by disrupting the signaling pathways that drive tumor cell growth or resistance to monoclonal antibody therapy. This includes, for example tumor cell growth driven by NRG1 fusions interacting with the HER3 receptor. Hard-to-target receptors that may drive tumor growth or escape can be targeted by our Dock and Block® mechanism whereby the binding a tumor associated target prevalent on cancer cells facilitates a second domain to bind and block lesser expressed targets that are critical for cancer growth.

•Engaging an adaptive immune response by recruiting T-cells and/or modulating co-stimulation or checkpoint inhibition. We can produce multispecific antibodies that are designed to simultaneously bind to the T-cell antigen CD3 or other effector cell engaging antigens, and/or tumor-associated targets, for a potentially potent T cell or other effector cell recruitment and engagement to selectively kill tumor cells. 
 •Engaging the innate immune response through multiple mechanisms. We can produce enhanced ADCC modifications in the Fc region of our Biclonics® or Triclonics® designed to facilitate the recruitment of immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells, or NK cells, and macrophages, to directly kill tumor cells. Specific binding domains engineered in multispecific antibodies can directly bind to macrophages and monocytes; NK cells, each providing specific immune cell function to attack cancer cells. 
 
•Employing combinations of the above mechanisms. Using our platforms, we can design antibodies to simultaneously target a growth factor receptor expressed by tumor cells and an immunomodulatory molecule involved in blocking and/or reactivating tumor-specific T cells. Biclonics® and Triclonics® can be designed to target growth factor receptors, like 


epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) and HER2 that are expressed on many tumors, while delivering an activation signal or checkpoint blockade to T cells.

Our process to select lead Biclonics® for clinical development is illustrated below. We use our patented MeMo®, Spleen to Screen®\, heterodimerization technology, human antibody generation and Biclonics® production technologies to rapidly build large collections of Biclonics® or Triclonics® directed against particular target combinations. We then test these collections in cell-based functional assays to identify multispecific antibodies that have the potential for novel and innovative modes of action. We select the most potent or efficacious and evaluate them in multiple in vitro and in vivo assays to identify lead candidates for clinical development.

Selection of Lead Multiclonics®





Our Biclonics® technology platform includes the following:
 
Human antibody generation. Our platform for generating human antibodies employs our patented transgenic common light chain technology, which we refer to as MeMo®, which harbors human heavy chain variable regions and a human common light chain in its germline. MeMo® harnesses the power of the in vivo immune system to yield human antibodies with the potential for high affinity, specificity, optimal biophysical characteristics and low immunogenicity. Upon immunization, MeMo® is capable of generating large and diverse panels of human common light chain antibodies against a broad variety of targets. These human common light chain antibodies are then used to generate large and diverse panels of human multispecific antibodies capable of binding different targets of virtually any combination.
 •Patented dimerization technology and the full-length Immunoglobulin G format. Our Biclonics® consist of two different heavy chains that need to stably form, or heterodimerize, inside a manufacturing cell line. Using our patented dimerization technology, we employ amino acid residues with opposite charges in the CH3 domains of these heavy chains to efficiently drive the formation of the heterodimer bispecific antibody rather than the homodimer antibody consisting of two copies of the same heavy chain. In addition, the use of a single, or common, light chain in our human Biclonics® antibodies ensures that each heavy chain pairs with the correct, common light chain to efficiently form the intended functional antigen binding regions. The combination of these approaches prevents the need for additional, more artificial techniques, such as the use of linkers or chemical reactions, to force the pairing of different parts of the bispecific antibody. In addition, the format is designed to retain favorable attributes of conventional human IgG mAbs, including their stability and predictability during manufacturing as well as their long half-life and low immunogenicity during treatment of patients. The resulting Biclonics® are bispecific heterodimeric IgG antibodies that are designed to closely mimic IgG antibodies that are produced naturally by the immune system. 
 

The Biclonics® format also permits us to make modifications to the Fc region of the IgG antibody in order to enhance or limit effector functions associated with this part of the molecule. This strategy has been successfully executed with conventional therapeutic mAbs. In order to enhance efficacy and promote immunotherapeutic activity, we can use glycoengineered cell lines used in production to generate Biclonics® that are enhanced for ADCC, resulting in the improved ability to recruit NK cells and macrophages. This ADCC enhancement has been made to our most advanced bispecific antibody candidate, zenocutuzumab, and other of our antibody candidates, MCLA-158 (petosemtamab) and MCLA-129. In order to improve safety and tolerability, we can modify our Biclonics® to prevent the excessive release of signaling proteins called cytokines, which can overstimulate the immune system. This process is called Fc-silencing, and is designed to block the ability of our Biclonics® to bind to certain protein receptors on cells, known as Fc receptors, which are associated with cytokine release. We utilize Fc silencing in the design of our bispecific antibody candidate MCLA-145.

•High-throughput functional screening. We employ our patented Spleen to Screen® technology to rapidly screen panels of new target-specific heavy chains that form common light chain binding domains, or we employ our already established panels of common light chain antibodies. To date we have discovered over 10,000 unique common light chain antibodies directed at more than 40 different antigens, including tumor-associated antigens such as EGFR and c-MET; T-cell binding, stimulating or co-stimulating proteins such as CD3 and CD137 (also called 4-1BB); and other immune-cell engaging antigens. For example, we have an established a panel of more than 175 unique and novel anti-CD3 common light chain antibodies from which to discover and develop the next generation of T-cell engaging bispecific and trispecific antibodies. We then generate DNA constructs that encode target-specific human antibodies and express them in mammalian cells. The common light chain format and proprietary dimerization modifications to the CH3 domain of the IgG promote the secretion of virtually pure Biclonics® into the cell culture medium. The medium of thousands of cell cultures that each express a different Biclonics® is harvested and individually used in high throughput molecular and cell-based functional assays to identify Biclonics® with specific novel characteristics for further development. 
 
For example, the chart below shows the results of a pre-clinical study in which hundreds of different Biclonics® targeting HER2 and HER3 were functionally screened for cell growth inhibition of tumor cell samples in the presence or absence of the HER3 ligand NRG1. Forty of the Biclonics® depicted in the chart exhibited superior inhibition of cell growth compared to trastuzumab, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of breast cancer, and were selected in the process leading to identification of zenocutuzumab.



Advantages of Biclonics®

We believe our Biclonics® technology platform provides the following advantages:
 
•Rapid generation of human IgG antibodies having diversity at the heavy chain targeting an array of antigens, that are ready to be paired to produce our Biclonics®, bispecific antibodies. Use of our patented MeMo®, Spleen to Screen®, heterodimerization and Fc modification technologies, permits us to rapidly generate a large amount of diverse bispecific antibodies capable of targeting an array of antigen combinations. 
 

•Biclonics® are stable, bispecific, full-length human IgG antibodies with no linkers or fusion proteins. Biclonics® retain the IgG format of antibodies that are produced naturally by the immune system. Additionally, in contrast to many other bispecific antibody formats, Biclonics® do not require linkers or modifications to force the correct pairing of heavy and light chain variable regions or exploit fusion proteins to add functionality to the molecule. These qualities minimize time-consuming engineering efforts that can cause stability or developability obstacles, and instead allow us to create Biclonics® with more predictable behavior during development. 
 
•Our Biclonics® technology platform allows for functional evaluation of Biclonics® in the relevant therapeutic format leading to the discovery of therapeutic candidates with novel and innovative properties. Our Biclonics® technology platform permits rapid functional screening of large collections of bispecific antibodies which allows us to identify lead candidates with multiple mechanisms of action that have the potential to effectively kill tumor cells with high potency. This is an important step in the identification of lead bispecific antibody candidates with functionalities that compare favorably against other forms of therapeutics, such as conventional mAbs as well as their combinations.
 
•Biclonics® preserve the stability, behavior and adaptability of normal IgG antibodies. Biclonics® are based on the robust and commonly used IgG format to yield the favorable in vivo qualities associated with conventional mAbs, such as stability, long half-life and low immunogenicity. As a result, our Biclonics® format provides attractive options for dosage schedules and methods of administration, rendering them compatible with multiple modes of action for the efficient killing of tumor cells. Further, the IgG format allows us to apply previously established technologies to further optimize our Biclonics® for therapeutic use. 
 
•Biclonics® can be reliably manufactured with high yields. Because our Biclonics® retain the IgG format of antibodies, our Biclonics® are manufactured using the large-scale industry-standard processes that are also used for the production of conventional mAbs, and the yields of Biclonics® we obtain are comparable to those of normal IgG antibodies. In stable cell lines, and using our IgG-based purification process can result in up to greater than 98% purity for our Biclonics®. 
 
Our Triclonics® Platform
Our Triclonics® technology is covered by existing Merus patents and other pending applications. This format, and the suite of technologies that underpin it, permit the development of therapeutic candidates designed to bind three targets with a single multivalent molecule. In pre-clinical studies and modeling, Triclonics® have shown similar qualities of a natural IgG antibody, including favorable half-life, stability, low immunogenicity and favorable developability characteristics. We believe Triclonics® have the potential to produce significant specificity and potency in tumor cell-killing activity and/or to modulate the immune system to promote more robust anti-tumor immune responses, and have the potential for less on-target off-tumor toxicity. This format allows us to leverage our proprietary genetically modified MeMo® mice, which as described above, harbors human heavy chain variable region gene segments and a human common light chain in its germline. MeMo® harnesses the power of the in vivo immune system to yield human antibodies with the potential for high affinity, specificity, optimal biophysical characteristics and low immunogenicity, which can be combined into a single trispecific antibody produced with relative high purity. The Triclonics® platform employs our proprietary technologies to produce large panels of substantially pure trispecific antibodies. In addition, we have engineered a panel of novel linkers that attach a third binding domain to the antibody. This panel of linkers vary in properties such as length and flexibility, and are empirically selected for stability and other drug-like properties, while remaining stable and are predicted to have low immunogenicity. The linker panel provides another lever of flexibility in optimizing functional characteristics in our high-throughput screening while maintaining high quality, stability and limiting risk of immunogenicity.
 





One application of the Triclonics® platform is as a T-cell engager for solid tumors. By binding to three targets, we can generate Triclonics® designed to specifically engage a combination of two tumor antigens for enhanced specificity, binding preferentially to tumor cells expressing both antigens, over normal tissues that may express either antigen, but not both or both at lower expression levels. In this construct, the third binding domain can, for example, engage an innate or adaptive immune effector cell protein, to stimulate killing of the tumor cell. We believe our Triclonics® platform will permit us to develop molecules with enhanced on-target, on-tumor specificity, while optimally engaging the immune system mechanisms and potentially having greater potency and a larger therapeutic window.
 


Our process to select lead Triclonics® leverages our patented MeMo® and Spleen to Screen® human antibody generation and heterodimerization technologies, along with our proprietary linkers based on natural structures to undertake high throughput unbiased functional screening of Triclonics®. With this approach, we have been able to evaluate up to 1,800 different trispecific antibodies targeting three different antigens to identify those unique combinations that pre-clinically have been observed to have desired characteristics for further development.

Our Bispecific and Trispecific Antibody Candidate Portfolio
We currently have four bispecific antibody candidates in clinical development, with additional bispecific and trispecific programs in pre-clinical development.

Zenocutuzumab (MCLA-128, HER3 x HER2 Biclonics®)
 Zenocutuzumab is an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enhanced Biclonics® that utilizes Merus’ Dock & Block® mechanism to bind to HER2, and bind to and disrupt the interaction between HER3 and ligand, NRG1 or mutated form NRG1 fusion, in solid tumors. HER2, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is amplified in many solid tumors and is associated with poor prognosis, and the activation of HER3, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 3, is associated with tumor progression and treatment resistance. On the surface of tumor cells, HER2 pairs, or dimerizes, with HER3, and the resulting pair drives malignant progression of HER2-expressing cancer cells. NRG1, which is the ligand for HER3, causes cancer cells to grow and become resistant to treatment with HER2-targeted therapies. Zenocutuzumab is believed to target the HER3 signaling pathway by disrupting the interaction of HER3 with its ligand NRG1 and to overcome the resistance of tumor cells to HER2-targeted therapies using two mechanisms: blocking growth and survival pathways to stop tumor expansion and recruitment, and ADCC-enhanced elimination of the tumor via effector cells. In addition, we have identified a rare, genetically defined patient population whose cancers harbor NRG1 fusions. The NRG1 gene encodes for neuregulin, the ligand for HER3. Fusions between NRG1 and other genes in the genome are rare genetic events occurring in solid tumors, and are associated with activation of HER2/HER3 signaling and growth of cancer cells. The NRG1 fusion is a powerful driver of cancer cell growth. We believe that pre-clinical studies and clinical evaluation indicate zenocutuzumab (binding to HER2 and blocking NRG1 fusion protein interaction with HER3) has the potential to be particularly effective against tumors harboring NRG1 fusions.
Development
 In our pre-clinical studies, the administration of zenocutuzumab resulted in the inhibition of NRG-induced growth in cultures of cancer cells. Zenocutuzumab also blocked activation of two key signaling pathways for the growth and survival of tumor cells more than Herceptin (trastuzumab) or the combination of Herceptin and Perjeta (pertuzumab) (shown in red below) or experimental anti-HER3 mAbs (shown in green below). See Geuijen et al. Cancer Cell (2018).



* indicates analog antibodies.
 In a patient-derived tumor xenograft mouse model (PDX model), zenocutuzumab significantly blocked tumor growth of a cancer containing an NRG1 gene fusion.
 




Based on encouraging pre-clinical results, we initiated a phase 1/2 study of zenocutuzumab in solid tumors.

•NRG1 Fusions and other potential cancers through targeting HER2 and HER3
 
We are currently enrolling patients for the phase 1/2 eNRGy trial to assess the anti-tumor activity of monotherapy zenocutuzumab in NRG1+ cancers. The eNRGy trial enrolls patients with NRG1+ solid tumors. Enrolled patients will receive 750 mg of zenocutuzumab every two weeks.
In June 2019, we opened a zenocutuzumab Early Access Program (EAP) and amended the phase 1/2 trial to focus on patients with solid tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion (the eNRGy trial). Patients treated under EAP and the protocol amendment receive zenocutuzumab at 750 mg administered intravenously every other week.
In January 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation of zenocutuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic solid tumors harboring NRG1 gene fusions that have progressed on standard-of-care therapy.
 In June 2022, we provided an update on the eNRGy trial and EAP at the American Society for Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO). The interim data, as of an April 12, 2022 efficacy data cutoff date, included zenocutuzumab treatment of 110 patients with NRG1+ pancreatic, NSCLC, and other cancers, 79 of whom were evaluable with measurable disease having the opportunity for six months or more follow-up and who met the criteria for the primary analysis with a median age of 59 (range 22-84). Partial responses (PRs) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1 as assessed by investigator review was 34% (95% CI; 24%-46%) across multiple tumor types. Tumor shrinkage was observed in 70% of patients. Median time to response was 1.8 months, and a median duration of exposure was 6.3 months. Median duration of response was 9.1 months, and 20/83 patients were continuing treatment as of the cutoff date.




Zenocutuzumab was observed to have a favorable and tolerable safety profile (across 208 patients treated with zenocutuzumab monotherapy as of the January 12, 2022 safety data cutoff date). The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity, and an absence of severe gastrointestinal and skin toxicities and clinical cardiotoxicity, and a low incidence (15%) of infusion reactions was observed.
 In October 2022, we met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding a potential Biologics License Application (BLA) filing for Zeno in NRG1+ cancer. Based on the FDA feedback, we believe multiple registrational paths remain viable, and have decided the optimal approach is to sequence its development plan by first seeking a potential application for NRG1+ lung and/or pancreatic cancer, which could then be followed by a potential tissue agnostic filing. We believe Zeno has the potential to be both first in class and best in class, and a new standard of care for the treatment of NRG1+ cancer.
 We plan to provide an update on the potential registrational path and timeline in NRG1+ cancer in the first half of 2023 and a clinical update on Zeno in NRG1+ cancer at a major medical conference in 2023.
 Further, we are evaluating a cohort exploring the combination of zenocutuzumab in addition to enzalutamide or abiraterone, an androgen deprivation therapy in CRPC, irrespective of NRG1+ status. Further, we are evaluating a cohort exploring the combination of zenocutuzumab and afatinib for patients with NRG1+ NSCLC. We plan to provide an initial clinical update on zenocutuzumab in CRPC in the second half of 2023.
 
Petosemtamab (MCLA-158, EGFR x LGR5 Biclonics®)
 Petosemtamab, is an investigational antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)-enhanced Biclonics® for the potential treatment of solid tumors that is designed to bind to cancer stem cells expressing leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) and EGFR. LGR5 is a WNT target gene expressed in cancer cells with aberrations in the WNT signaling pathway, while EGFR is a member of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is important for growth and survival of cancer stem cells, including those with RAS mutations. Petosemtamab is designed to use two different mechanisms of action. The first is intended to block growth and survival pathways in cancer stem cells. The second involves the recruitment and enhancement of immune effector cells in an effort to directly kill cancer stem cells that persist in solid tumors and cause relapse and metastasis.
 
Development
 In our pre-clinical studies, petosemtamab demonstrated superior growth inhibition and selectivity versus the EGFR-targeting mAb, cetuximab. Petosemtamab was significantly more potent than cetuximab in inhibiting the growth of patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids. Additionally, petosemtamab was observed to be selectively more active in human tumor-derived organoids than in organoids derived from normal human colon. The activity of petosemtamab on the tumor organoid size was more than 100 times greater than on the normal colon organoids. In contrast, the activity of cetuximab was similar to the activity of petosemtamab on normal colon organoids and 20 to 100 times less than the activity of petosemtamab on tumor organoids. These ex-vivo observations of petosemtamab with organoid models were further observed in vivo in xenograft models generated from the same patient-derived organoids.
 


In our pre-clinical studies, petosemtamab further demonstrated significant induction of internalization of EGFR and LGR5, resulting in EGFR degradation, and elicited potential anti-tumor activity in patient-derived esophageal, gastric and HNSCC xenograft models.








•Solid Tumors
 
Petosemtamab is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 open-label, multicenter study, and is in the expansion phase, in patients with solid tumors. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability of the defined dose; secondary endpoints include single-agent preliminary anti-tumor activity.
The recommended phase 2 dose was established at 1500 mg administered intravenously once every two weeks. Enrollment continues at this dose in the expansion phase of the open-label, multicenter trial.
 In October 2021, we presented interim clinical data from the ongoing phase 1 dose expansion cohort that is investigating the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of petosemtamab, including clinical responses observed in advanced HNSCC, at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Virtual International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. As of the efficacy data cutoff date of August 9, 2021, 10 patients with advanced HNSCC were enrolled, with median age of 65 (range 50-77) years, and who were treated with a median of 2 lines of prior therapy. Seven patients were evaluable for an interim efficacy analysis by investigator assessment (three patients were enrolled <8 weeks from the cutoff date). Three of seven patients achieved partial responses, with one of these three achieving complete response after the data cutoff date. Tumor reduction was observed in all seven patients. The safety results for petosemtamab were based on 29 patients with advanced solid tumors who were treated at 1500 mg every two weeks across the phase 1 trial. The most frequent adverse events were infusion related reactions; 72% any grade, 7% grade ≥ 3 and mild to moderate skin toxicity; 3% grade ≥3.
We plan to provide a clinical update on petosemtamab in the first half of 2023 at a medical conference. The planned update will include data from approximately 40 patients with HNSCC with meaningful clinical follow up, and data from patients with gastro-esophageal cancer, to inform clinical development strategy.
We further plan to provide a regulatory path update on petosemtamab in the first half of 2023.
 
MCLA-129 (EGFR x c-MET Biclonics®)
 
MCLA-129 is an investigational Biclonics®, designed to bind EGFR and c-MET, for the potential treatment of solid tumors. EGFR is an important oncogenic driver in many cancers. The upregulation of c-MET signaling has been associated with resistance to EGFR inhibition. MCLA-129 has two distinct mechanisms of action. First, MCLA-129 is designed to block the signaling of EGFR as well as c-MET, in an effort to inhibit tumor growth and survival. Second, MCLA-129 utilizes ADCC-enhancement technology, which is designed for greater cell-killing potential.
MCLA-129 is being developed in collaboration with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta). Under the terms of the collaboration, Betta is responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of MCLA-129, if approved, in China and we retain all rights to MCLA-129 outside of China. In January 2021, Betta announced that the Chinese National Medical Products Administration had accepted its IND for MCLA-129 injection and in October 2021, Betta announced that the first patient was dosed in Betta’s sponsored phase 1/2 trial of MCLA-129 in China in patients with advanced solid tumors.
 
Development


Pre-clinical data on MCLA-129 were presented in October 2019, at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. The poster, entitled “Pre-clinical evaluation of MCLA-129: a bispecific antibody targeting c-MET and EGFR,” showed that MCLA-129 inhibited and reversed resistance to tyrosine kinase resistant NSCLC, cell lines resulting in tumor growth inhibition in xenograft models of NSCLC. In these xenograft models, MCLA-129 showed tumor shrinkage in mice whose tumors are resistant to the EGFR small molecule inhibitor erlotinib.

MCLA-129 Inhibited TKI Resistant NSCLC | MCLA-129 Reversed Acquired TKI Resistance 

 
   
We believe these pre-clinical data suggest MCLA-129, if successfully developed and approved, could benefit patients having NSCLC that become resistant to EGFR targeted therapies.

•Solid Tumors
 
In May 2021, we commenced a phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating MCLA-129 for the treatment of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors.
The MCLA-129 trial is ongoing in the dose expansion phase, treating patients with MCLA-129 monotherapy in c-MET exon 14 mutant (m) NSCLC, EGFRex20 NSCLC, HNSCC, as well as in combination with Tagrisso (osimertinib) a third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in treatment naive EGFRm NSCLC and in patients with EGFRm NSCLC that have progressed on Tagrisso.
 In October 2022, we presented interim data from the ongoing phase 1/2 trial at the 34th EORTC/NCI/AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (ENA Symposium). As of a May 8, 2022 cutoff date, 20 patients were treated with MCLA-129 across doses of 100, 300, 600, 1000 and 1500 mg every two weeks. These patients were followed for safety and efficacy through a data cutoff of August 15, 2022, with 18 evaluable for efficacy, with two discontinuing before the second infusion.
 As of the August 15, 2022 cutoff date, the median age of patients was 65.5 years (range: 43-79), tumor types enrolled included 14 patients with EGFR m NSCLC (8 Del19, 4 L858R, 1 EGFRex20, 1 other), 2 patients with c-MET exon 14 m NSCLC, 1 patient with c-MET amplified gastric adenocarcinoma, 1 patient with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 1 patient with HNSCC. Antitumor activity was observed by investigator review, including 2 confirmed partial responses, and 4 additional patients with observed tumor shrinkage of greater than 20%. Time on treatment included a median duration of exposure of 12.6 weeks (range: 3-43 weeks), with 6 of 20 patients remaining ongoing as of the August 15, 2022 data cutoff, with the following internal safety and efficacy data presented:




As of the August 15, 2022 cutoff date, MCLA-129 was observed to be well tolerated based on 20 patients who received one or more doses of MCLA-129 across the dose levels tested. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were infusion-related reactions (IRR), with 90% of patients observed to experience IRR AEs of any grade, one patient (5%) experienced a grade 3, and no grade 4 or 5 AEs were observed. The majority of AEs occurred during the first infusion, with no treatment-related grade 4 or 5 AEs reported, and no interstitial lung disease reported. Based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, and these interim safety results an initial recommended phase 2 dose was selected at 1500 mg every two weeks.
 We plan to provide an initial clinical data update from the expansion cohorts, and a further clinical development strategy update in the second half of 2023.
 
MCLA-145 (CD137 x PD-L1 Biclonics®)
 MCLA-145 is a Biclonics® T-cell engager that binds to human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and CD137. MCLA-145 is designed to recruit, activate and prevent the exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T cells, and to cause a potent and durable T-cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. MCLA-145’s binding to a cell is predicted to lead to clustering of CD137 on T cells when PD-L1 is expressed on adjacent cells, and block the T-cell inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 interactions in the tumor. Developed by Merus through an unbiased functional screening of multiple immunomodulatory target combinations, the unique immunostimulatory profile of MCLA-145 derives from the potential to potently activate immune effector cells in the context of the tumor microenvironment while blocking inhibitory signals among T-cells within the same immune cell population.
 
Development
 In our pre-clinical studies, MCLA-145 showed binding to PD-L1 and CD137, recruitment of T cells into the tumor, blocking of inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1 axis and potent T-cell activation.




Further, MCLA-145 demonstrated superior tumor cell killing as compared to the administration of a combination of monospecific anti-PD-L1 and anti-CD137 antibodies in PDX models.


•Solid Tumors 
 MCLA-145 is currently enrolling a global, phase 1, open-label, single-agent clinical trial evaluating MCLA-145 in patients with solid tumors. The trial consists of a dose escalation phase, followed by a planned dose expansion phase. We are also evaluating the combination of MCLA-145 with a Keytruda (pembrolizumab) PD-1 blocking antibody with enrollment ongoing.
 In May 2019, we commenced a phase 1 open-label, single-agent clinical trial of MCLA-145, consisting of dose escalation followed by dose expansion, for the potential treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objectives of the phase 1 trial are dose finding and evaluation of safety and tolerability in patients. The trial will also examine potential preliminary antitumor activity and functional target engagement of single-agent MCLA-145.
 In December 2021, we presented interim clinical data on MCLA-145 from the phase 1 trial in patients with solid tumors at the ESMO Immuno-Oncology Congress 2021. As of the data cutoff date of July 14, 2021, 34 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with median age of 60.5 (range 27-81) years had been treated at 8 dose levels ranging from 0.4-75mg Q2W. The median (range) duration of treatment with MCLA 145 was approximately 6 (1–74) weeks. Reported adverse events (AEs) were generally managed

with drug interruption and/or administration of steroids in some patients. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurred in 33 patients (97.1%) and treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 23 patients (67.6%), most commonly fatigue (n=6, 17.6%) and decreased neutrophil count (n=6, 17.6%). Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), defined as within 28 days from the first infusion, occurred in 4 patients (11.8%).
Laboratory alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase (ALT/AST) elevations of any grade were observed in 15 patients (44.1%), with grade ≥3 ALT/AST elevations in 6 patients (17.6%). Preliminary evidence of antitumor activity has been observed at doses ≥25 mg biweekly. Analysis of peripheral blood showed robust T-cell activation, including activation of cytotoxic CD8+ cells and cytokines, across the 10 to 75 mg biweekly dosing range.
 
Pre-clinical Discovery Programs
 
We intend to further leverage our Biclonics® and Triclonics® technology platforms to identify multiple additional antibody candidates and advance them to clinical development. Each of these antibody candidates are designed to bind to targets believed to be useful in the treatment of cancer with an intention to establish efficacy and obtain information for submission to the FDA. Using our patented platforms, we will continue to evaluate new targets and combinations to identify potential candidates with the highest therapeutic potential and select those candidates to be advanced into clinical trials.
Collaboration Agreements
 
As part of our business strategy, we collaborate with a range of partners, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic companies, as well as academic institutions. We intend to continue to seek collaborations and license agreements to develop and commercialize therapeutics in order to exploit the potential of our Biclonics® and Triclonics® platforms.
Incyte Corporation

We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement (Collaboration Agreement) with Incyte Corporation (Incyte). Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Incyte have agreed to collaborate with respect to the research, discovery and development of monospecific or bispecific antibodies utilizing our proprietary Biclonics® technology platform. Following the election by Incyte to opt-out of its ex-U.S development of MCLA-145, discussed below, the collaboration encompasses up to 10 independent programs.
We have the option to co-fund development of products, if any, arising from one specified program, and subject to certain conditions, to a second specified program, in each case in exchange for a share of profits in the United States, as well as the right to participate in a specified proportion of detailing activities in the United States for one of such programs. If we exercise our co-funding option for a program, we would be responsible for funding 35% of the associated future global development costs and, for certain of such programs, would be responsible for reimbursing Incyte for certain development costs incurred prior to the option exercise. All products as to which we have exercised our option to co-fund development would be subject to joint development plans and overseen by a joint development committee, with Incyte having final determination as to such plans in cases of dispute.
For one of our current clinical programs, concerning MCLA-145, under the Collaboration Agreement, Incyte had received the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the product candidate outside the United States. In January 2022, we announced that Incyte elected to opt-out of its ex-U.S. development of MCLA-145, restoring full global rights to Merus. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Incyte supported the program for a limited time while ex-U.S. activities transitioned to Merus. Incyte retains a right to a residual royalty of up to 4% on sales of future commercialization of MCLA-145, if approved.


For each program, where we have not elected to co-fund development or where we do not have such a co-funding option and which has not been dropped or terminated by Incyte, Incyte is solely responsible for all costs of global development and commercialization activities. We retain the rights to, among other things, our Biclonics® technology platform as well as clinical and pre-clinical candidates and future programs emerging from our platform that are outside the scope of the Collaboration Agreement.
In January 2017, upon the Collaboration Agreement becoming effective, Incyte made an upfront non-refundable payment to us of $120 million for the rights granted under the Collaboration Agreement. For each program as to which we do not have commercialization or co-development rights, we are eligible to receive up to $100 million in future contingent development and regulatory milestones and up to $250 million in commercialization milestones, as well as tiered royalties ranging from 6% to 10% of global net sales. For each program as to which we have exercised our option to co-fund development, we are eligible to receive a 50% share of profits (or sustain 50% of any losses) in the United States and tiered royalties ranging from 6% to 10% of net sales of products outside of the United States. If we opt to cease co-funding a program as to which we exercised our co-development option, then we will no longer receive a share of profits in the United States but will be eligible to receive the same milestones from the co-funding termination date and the same tiered royalties described above with respect to non-co-developed programs and, depending on the stage at which we choose to cease co-funding development costs, additional royalties ranging up to 4% of net sales in the United States.
The Collaboration Agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until neither party has any royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier, the termination of the Collaboration Agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated in its entirety, or on a program-by-program basis, by Incyte for convenience. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material breach, or on a program-by-program basis for patent challenge of patents under the applicable program, in each case as set forth in the Collaboration Agreement. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to one or more programs, all rights in the terminated programs revert to us, subject to payment to Incyte of a reverse royalty of up to 4% on sales of future products, if we elect to pursue development and commercialization of products arising from the terminated programs.
In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Share Subscription Agreement with Incyte, pursuant to which, in January 2017, we issued and sold to Incyte 3,200,000 common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $80.0 million.

Eli Lilly and Company (Eli Lilly)
 In 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the Lilly Collaboration Agreement) and share subscription agreement (the “Lilly Subscription Agreement”) with Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana corporation (Eli Lilly).
 Under the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we and Eli Lilly agreed to collaborate with respect to the discovery and research of bispecific antibodies utilizing our proprietary Biclonics® bispecific technology platform. The collaboration encompasses up to three (3) independent programs directed to the generation of T-cell re-directing bispecific antibodies that bind CD3 and a tumor associated antigen target selected by Eli Lilly (Target) to be the subject of each such program.
 We granted to Eli Lilly an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license, under certain patent rights and know-how to exploit certain compounds and products directed to designated Targets in combination with CD3, or directed to such designated Target(s) alone as a monospecific antibody or monospecific antibody drug conjugate, subject to rights granted by us to third parties under one or more existing third-party agreements. We also retain all rights not granted to Eli Lilly.
 Additionally, in the case of a change of control that may adversely impact certain rights and obligations of us and Eli Lilly under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, (a) we have agreed to terminate or transfer its rights to third parties under certain research programs and (b) Eli Lilly has the option to take over certain of our research obligations.
 Eli Lilly paid an upfront, non-refundable payment of $40 million for the rights granted under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement. Eli Lilly agreed to fund the research and development activities we conduct for each program under an agreed research plan and budget. With respect to each product arising from each program, we are eligible to receive up to $290 million in future contingent development and regulatory milestones and up to $250 million in commercial sales milestones, for a total of up to approximately $1.6 billion for a single product generated from all three programs. We are further eligible to receive, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties based on the level of worldwide aggregate annual net sales at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits until the royalty term expires.
 The Lilly Collaboration Agreement includes a three-year research term for us to perform research and development activities, subject to two extension terms of six months at Eli Lilly’s discretion. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis until Eli Lilly has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such product or, if earlier, the termination of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement may be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis at will by Eli Lilly. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either us or Eli Lilly under certain other circumstances, including material breach, as set forth in the Lilly Collaboration Agreement. If the Lilly Collaboration Agreement is terminated with respect to one or more programs, depending on the stage of development, certain rights in the terminated programs revert to us, in accordance with the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement.


Also in January 2021, in connection with entering into the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to the Lilly Subscription Agreement, Eli Lilly agreed to purchase 706,834 common shares of the Company at a price per share of $28.295 for aggregate gross proceeds to us of approximately $20 million (the “Private Placement”).
Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
 
In April 2014, we entered into a strategic research and license agreement with Ono, under which we granted Ono an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to research, test, make, use and market a limited set of bispecific antibody candidates, if approved, based on our Biclonics® technology platform, directed to two undisclosed targets.
 Ono paid us a non-refundable upfront fee of €1.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of €57.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified research and clinical development milestones. For products commercialized under this agreement, if any, we are also eligible to receive a mid-single digit royalty on net sales. For a designated period, which may include limited time periods following termination of this agreement, in certain circumstances we and our affiliates are prohibited from researching, developing or commercializing bispecific antibodies against the target combination that are the subject of this agreement. Ono also provides funding for our research and development activities under an agreed-upon plan. This research and license agreement will expire after all milestone payments have been received and all related patent rights have expired, unless terminated earlier. Ono has the right to terminate this agreement at any time for any reason, with or without cause. The licenses granted to Ono may convert to royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual licenses if Ono terminates the agreement for uncured material breach. We retain all rights to use and commercialize any antibodies directed to one target utilized under the collaborative research program, and any antibodies directed to the second target developed under the collaborative research program, excluding the up to five lead and/or selected antibodies against the second target Ono is pursuing, provided that the use and commercialization is not with respect to the particular target combination. To date, we have achieved five of the specified milestones under this research and license agreement and have received an aggregate of €4.7 million in milestone payments.
 On March 14, 2018, we entered into a second contract research and license agreement with Ono. Pursuant to an exclusive option granted to Ono in the prior agreement executed in April 2014, Ono exercised its option to enter into the March 2018 agreement. We granted Ono an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, research, test, make, use and market bispecific antibody candidates based on our Biclonics® technology platform against two undisclosed targets directed to a particular undisclosed target combination. Ono identifies and selects the licensed bispecific antibodies for which it is responsible for conducting further non-clinical and clinical development activities for such licensed bispecific antibodies and pharmaceutical products containing such antibodies, including manufacture and process development. Ono controls and has exclusive rights over the worldwide commercialization of any approved products, including worldwide supply, and is solely responsible for all costs and expenses related to commercialization. Ono has agreed to fund our research and development activities and be responsible for the payment of all costs and expenses for its own research and development activities, which are set out in a mutually agreed upon research plan. We retain all rights to use and commercialize any antibodies that are generated under the collaborative research program, excluding the up to five lead and/or selected antibodies against the targets Ono is pursuing, provided that the use and commercialization is not with respect to the particular target combination.
 As part of the 2018 agreement, Ono agreed to pay an upfront non-refundable payment of €0.7 million for the rights granted and we are also eligible to receive an additional aggregate of €57.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of specified research and clinical development milestones.

The licenses granted to Ono may convert to royalty-free, fully-paid, perpetual licenses if Ono terminates the agreement for uncured material breach.
 
Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd.
On December 10, 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Betta) where we granted Betta an exclusive license to develop and commercialize MCLA-129 in China. We retain all rights outside of China. Under the terms of the agreement, Betta retained a contract manufacturing organization with experience in filing IND applications with U.S. authorities and clinical trial applications (CTAs) with European regulatory authorities in order to produce clinical trial materials for the Chinese market and the rest of the world.

In addition to a non-refundable upfront payment, we and Betta will share equally the cost of the transfer of the manufacturing technology to a contract manufacturing organization. We are also eligible to receive an aggregate of $12.0 million in milestone payments contingent upon Betta achieving certain specified development and commercial goals as well as tiered royalty payments of net sales of any products resulting from the collaboration in China. Betta is eligible to receive milestone payments contingent upon us achieving certain specified development and commercial goals, and is eligible to receive tiered royalty payments of net sales outside of China.

Manufacturing
Our Biclonics® technology platform relies on third parties for biological materials. We rely on and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for the supply of current good manufacturing practice-grade (cGMP-grade) clinical trial materials and commercial quantities of our antibody candidates and products, if approved. We currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of product candidates, but we have contracted several biopharmaceutical CMOs for the clinical manufacture of zenocutuzumab, MCLA-158 or petosemtamab, MCLA-129 and MCLA-145. We believe that the standardized Biclonics® manufacturing process can be transferred to additional CMOs and potential future co-development or co-commercialization collaborations or partnerships for the production of clinical and commercial supplies of our Biclonics® in the ordinary course of business.
Sales and Marketing
We have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for zenocutuzumab, petosemtamab, MCLA-129, MCLA-145 or any of our other antibody candidates because our antibody candidates are still in pre-clinical or early-to-middle-stage clinical development. We hired an Executive Vice President & Chief Commercial Officer in February 2022, to lead the commercial strategy for Merus’ pipeline of multispecific product candidates in development. Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval, if any, for one of our antibody candidates.
Competition
 We compete directly with companies that focus on oncology and companies dedicating their resources to cancer therapies. We also face competition from academic research institutions, governmental agencies and other various public and private research institutions. With the proliferation of new drugs and therapies into oncology, we expect to face increasingly intense competition as new technologies become available and new therapeutic candidates are clinically developed or approved therapies are explored for new indications. Any antibody candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, manufacturer’s production capacity, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic antibody candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, dosing convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe side effects than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Even if our antibody candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then.
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer, including other bispecific antibodies or similar molecules. Our closest competitors in this area include Genmab A/S, Inhibrx, Inc., Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, MacroGenics, Inc., Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Xencor, Inc. The antibody candidates in development by competitors may provide efficacy, safety, dosing convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our antibody candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.

For important factors related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and antibody candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Information Technology.”
 

Government Regulation
 We are subject to extensive regulation. We expect our antibody candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
•completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, and pre-clinical animal trials and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practices (GLPs); 
 
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 
•approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations, commonly referred to as good clinical practice (GCP), regulations and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
 
•submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 
•potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
 
Before testing any antibody candidate in humans, the antibody candidate enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical trials, generally include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the antibody candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds, at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological antibody candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and

approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

•Phase 1. The biological antibody candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 
•Phase 2. The biological antibody candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 
•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 
In some cases, the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. These so-called phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological antibody candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the biological antibody candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological antibody candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological antibody candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological antibody candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan within sixty days after an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the

application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological antibody candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation (or orphan designation) to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan drug or product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan drug or product has exclusivity. If a drug or biological product has an orphan designation it receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast

Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. With regard to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a biologic product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process. A BLA is eligible for priority review if a product candidate is intended to treat a serious disease or condition, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful advantages over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical trials. Biological products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory clinical trials in a timely manner or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast Track designation, priority review and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if we receive one of these designations for our antibody candidates, the FDA may later decide that our antibody candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.

Post-Approval Requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers of approved biologics are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, and reporting updated safety and efficacy information.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:


•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 •clinical holds on clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims that are in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict a manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own pre-clinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.

FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 We expect that our antibody candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our products. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the United States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FD&C Act) and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (PMA) approval. We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for use with our antibody candidates may utilize the PMA pathway.
 If use of a companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014,

the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel candidates such as our antibody candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug or biologic candidate may be required to be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling, although the FDA may decide that it is appropriate to approve a therapeutic product even though a companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared contemporaneously. In general, the FDA expects that a companion diagnostic that is intended for use with the therapeutic product will be later approved or cleared through an appropriate submission and the therapeutic product labeling will be revised to stipulate the use of the companion diagnostic. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document intended to further assist sponsors of therapeutic products and sponsors of in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of these products, and in April 2020, the FDA issued final guidance describing considerations for the development and labeling of in vitro companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products.
The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and pre-clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trials or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 

Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene-editing technology, gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Non-Clinical Studies and Clinical Trials
 Similarly to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union (EU) are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), guidelines on Good Clinical Practices (GCP) as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (CTA) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. Clinical trials for which an application was submitted (i) prior to January 31, 2022 under the Clinical Trials Directive, or (ii) between January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2023 and for which the sponsor has opted for the application of the Clinical Trials Directive remain governed by said Directive until January 31, 2025. After this date, all clinical trials (including those which are ongoing) will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
 Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and national regulators provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application of the product concerned.


Marketing Authorizations
 In the EU, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization (MA). To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product in the EEA, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
 The centralized procedure results in a single MA, issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA which is valid across the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines and (iv) advanced-therapy medicinal products, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases and in particular for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the EU or for product candidates which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or for which the granting of authorization would be in the interests of public health in the EU.
Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the European Commission. If this opinion is favorable, the Commission may then adopt a decision to grant an MA.
MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the European Commission or the competent authority of the EU member states decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal.
 Under the centralized procedure and in exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation includes the appointment of a rapporteur from the CHMP before submission of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving MA, reference medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
Orphan Medicinal Products
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if its sponsor can establish that: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate

sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized procedure. Upon grant of a MA, orphan medicinal products are entitled to a ten-year period of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication, which means that during this period, the regulatory authorities cannot accept another application for a MA, or grant a MA or accept an application to extend an existing MA for the same indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the MA is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. Additionally, MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
•the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
 •the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
 •the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another.
 Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.



Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 In the EU, in vitro diagnostic medical devices were regulated by Directive 98/79/EC which regulated the placing on the market, the CE-marking, the essential requirements, the conformity assessment procedures, the registration obligations for manufactures and devices as well as the vigilance procedure. In vitro diagnostic medical devices had to comply with the requirements provided for in the Directive, and with further requirements implemented at national level (as the case may be).
The regulation of companion diagnostics is subject to further requirements since the in vitro diagnostic devices Regulation (No 2017/746) (IVDR) became applicable on May 26, 2022. However, on October 14, 2021, the European Commission proposed a “progressive” roll-out of the IVDR to prevent disruption in the supply of in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The European Parliament and Council adopted the proposed regulation on December 15, 2021. The IVDR fully applies as of May 26, 2022 but there is a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices (depending on their risk classification) before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation. The IVDR which introduces a new classification system for companion diagnostics which are now specifically defined as diagnostic tests that support the safe and effective use of a specific medicinal product, by identifying patients that are suitable or unsuitable for treatment. Companion diagnostics will have to undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue an EU certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from the EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic to the medicinal product concerned if the medicinal product falls exclusively within the scope of the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicines, or the medicinal product is already authorized through the centralized procedure, or a MA application for the medicinal product has been submitted through the centralized procedure. For other substances, the notified body can seek the opinion from a national Competent Authorities or the EMA.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
 
Other Healthcare Laws

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment and drug pricing transparency laws. Similar laws exist in foreign jurisdictions as well.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved (e.g., off-label) uses. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have

similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. The ACA imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, as defined by statute, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of pricing and marketing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 

Violations of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement is required, and/or individual imprisonment.

To the extent that any of our antibody candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

Privacy and Data Protection Laws in the United States
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH made HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. By way of example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) effective January 1, 2020, which gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that has increased the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) generally went into effect on January 1, 2023 and significantly amends the CCPA. It imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which will likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. Similar laws have passed in Virginia, Connecticut, Utah and Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging.
Privacy and Data Protection Laws in Europe

We are subject to European laws relating to our and our suppliers’, collaborators’ and subcontractors’ (where they act as processors) collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e., any data relating to an identifiable living individual, whether that individual can be identified directly or indirectly). We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established, and where we process personal data in the context of the activities of that establishment (e.g., undertaking clinical trials). We and our suppliers, collaborators and subcontractors process personal data including in relation to our employees, employees of customers, clinical trial patients, healthcare professionals and employees of suppliers including health and medical information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and national laws and regulations implementing or supplementing it.

The GDPR requires that personal data is only collected for specified, explicit and legal purposes as set out in the GDPR or local laws, and the data may then only be processed in a manner compatible with those purposes. The personal data collected and processed must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and processed, it must be held securely, not transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection, and must not be retained for longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. In addition, the GDPR requires companies processing personal data to take certain organizational steps to ensure that they have adequate records, policies, security, training and governance frameworks in place to ensure, and to be able to demonstrate, protection. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, makes it harder for us to obtain valid consent for processing, may require the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (i.e., health data) is processed on a sufficiently large scale, introduces mandatory data breach notification throughout the EU and imposes additional obligations on us when we are contracting with certain service providers.

In addition, to the extent a company processes, controls or otherwise uses “special category” personal data (including patients’ health or medical information, genetic information and biometric information), more stringent rules apply, further limiting the circumstances and the manner in which a company is legally permitted to process that data. The GDPR provides a broad right for EU and EEA member states to create supplemental national laws which may result in divergence across Europe making it harder to maintain a consistent operating model or standard operating procedures. Such laws, for example, may relate to the processing of health, genetic and biometric data, which could further limit our ability to use and share such data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition.

From January 1, 2021, we are subject to the GDPR and also the United Kingdom (UK) GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the United Kingdom, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/ extends that decision. At present, the UK GDPR permits transfers of personal data from the United Kingdom to the EEA and to any countries which, as of December 31, 2020, were covered by an European Commission adequacy decision. This permission is to be kept under review by the UK Government.
 
There are costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with the GDPR and the resultant changes in the EU and EEA member states’ national laws. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with global privacy laws carries with it the risk of significant penalties and sanctions of up to €20 million or up to 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year. Additionally, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EEA and the EU, and the expiry of the transition period, companies have to comply with the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. These laws or new interpretations, enactments or supplementary forms of these laws, could create liability for us, could impose additional operational requirements on our business, could affect the manner in which we use and transmit patient information and could increase our cost of doing business. Claims of violations of privacy rights or contractual breaches, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.
 
Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EU to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield), under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to US entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. Complementary, on September 8, 2020 the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States pursuant to Switzerland’s Federal Act on Data Protection. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of

the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. In March 2022, the US and EU announced a new regulatory regime intended to replace the invalidated regulations; however, this new EU-US Data Privacy Framework has not been implemented beyond an executive order signed by President Biden on October 7, 2022 on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities. European court and regulatory decisions subsequent to the CJEU decision of July 16, 2020 have taken a restrictive approach to international data transfers.
 
These recent developments may require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and/ or receive personal data transfers to/ in the U.S. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.

In the United States, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our bispecific antibody candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical or biological product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for new products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.

In the EU, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Member states are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. Member states may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of pharmaceutical or biological products have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.


Healthcare Reform

A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; and created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare.

In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 as signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. Moreover, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biological products. Most recently, on August 16, 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, and the impact of the IRA on the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.

We expect that additional state, federal and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
 
Employees
 
As of January 1, 2023, we had 164 full-time employees and 57 part-time employees, including 90 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Of these employees, 157 were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 64 were primarily engaged in general and administrative activities. We are proud of our diversity, with 106 employees identifying as male and 115 identifying as female and with over 25 different nationalities represented. None of our employees are part of a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
Our Values and Culture
 
Our goal is to help patients overcome the devastating disease of cancer. Our values reflect the way we go about achieving this goal. It is a declaration both of who we are and who we want to be. These are principles we strive to live up to and to be measured by:
 •We are creative problem solvers – we nurture inquisitive minds and diverse talents, to create solutions to some of today’s most pressing medical needs in oncology. We accept setbacks as an inevitable part of innovation, and we welcome them as an opportunity to learn.


•We commit and move as one – we are one company with a common goal of closing in on cancer. We work as a team and encourage a diversity of perspectives. When we take a decision, we unite and move forward together.
 •We aim at excellence – our work impacts lives. We honor this with our every decision and take collective responsibility to uphold our goal. We strive to do the right things and take pride in doing them well.
 •We care – everything we do, we do because we care. We care deeply about improving patients’ lives. We respect and support each other and the communities around us.
 

We believe our values are an important facet of who we are and how we will deliver on our goals to close in on cancer, and meet our mission.
 


Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 
All employees are expected to conduct business with the highest standard of business ethics. Each employee receives and agrees to follow the Merus Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Employees are encouraged to discuss any related concerns with management

or report concerns anonymously through an Ethics Hotline. Any report received on the Ethics Hotline is investigated by our General Counsel or the Audit Committee, as applicable. Further, we have three employee confidential advisors, as well as an external confidential advisor, with whom our employees may discuss ways of addressing, preventing and combating inappropriate behavior in the workplace. No one shall be subject to adverse action who in good faith reports an incident of violation of our policies, provides information, or otherwise assists in any investigation. Any employee who retaliates against another in violation of our policies will be subjected to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Employership, Leadership and Training

We perform biannual employee surveys, which give employees the opportunity to provide feedback on our employee engagement, commitment, leadership, work atmosphere, role clarity, psychological security, and employership, as well as annual surveys of a smaller scope. These surveys are managed by a third-party vendor to encourage openness and honesty in responding to questions regarding these important factors. In 2021, our employee response rate to our biannual survey was 87 percent, which we believe is an indication that our employees recognize that their feedback is important. Further, we were named a “World-Class Workplace” by the third-party vendor based on the outcome of the employee engagement survey, which demonstrated that Merus scored above other companies in the Netherlands on aspects of employership themes and how likely is it that an employee would recommend Merus as an employer to others. Further, we scored higher marks on pride of organization, inspiring vision of the future, leadership, work atmosphere and satisfaction about the organization than benchmarks for employership established by the vendor through its survey results based on average scores across surveys from over 500 other organizations.
 
Critical to our success is the hiring, training, retention and promotion of our employees, as we develop the competencies needed for the advancement of our company today and that will be needed in the coming years. Accordingly, we developed a variety of leadership and development opportunities under an umbrella program we refer to as the Merus Academy. A pillar of this program is a leadership development program, where we work with a third-party provider to help train and enhance the leadership skills of employees at the director to vice president level. Another pillar is a leadership essentials training, which we offer to our scientists to help enhance their individual effectiveness, improve leadership ability, develop skills to address change and conflict management, and enhance their thought leadership within the organization. A third pillar is our implementation of an online learning platform, which offers our employees training courses across a variety of disciplines. Each of these pillars supports our talent management and advancement to drive our corporate goals.
 
Equal Opportunity
 
We are an equal employment opportunity employer that does not discriminate on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions), sexual orientation, age, ancestry, disability or perceived disability, qualified handicap, gender identity, military status, veteran status, certain criminal records, genetic information or testing, HIV testing, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws (each, a “Protected Characteristic”). We are dedicated to this policy with respect to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities and general treatment during employment. Equal opportunities are important to us. To evaluate our performance, we asked an external party to assess whether there is a different in compensation of men and women at Merus. The outcome of the assessment was that there was not different compensation between men and women in comparable positions/roles within Merus. Equal opportunity is also reflected in the diversity within our Management Team, which is a mixture of men and women, and in our Board Diversity Policy.
Compensation Philosophy, Incentives and Retention
 
Our human capital strategies, hiring and retention outcomes are reviewed on a regular basis with our board of directors, to align with our overall business strategies. Further, we review our compensation philosophy annually with the compensation committee of our board of directors, as well as on an ad hoc basis to receive input on new hires during the course of the year. Our compensation committee, relying on their extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and receiving input from our external compensation advisors, review our short and long term incentive programs, and evaluate our group of peer companies to help achieve our hiring and retention goals during the course of the year. Our board of directors receives regular updates on these objectives, including headcount plans, achievement against goals and attrition rates during the year.
Health and Safety
 
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges associated with the normal function of businesses worldwide, as it has for Merus. We have adapted and met these challenges with the support and guidance of our COVID Task Force comprised of members of our management team, which meets as needed, and provides updates to the full management team, the board of directors, and company personnel on ways in which we are addressing the applicable guidance

provided by national, state, local and foreign officials including the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European local health agencies, including the Dutch National Institute for Health and Environment or Het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM). We have implemented workforce policies for our headquarters in the Netherlands, as well as our subsidiary in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for taking measures to comply with changing rules, regulations and recommendations by the CDC, RIVM, and local regulations. We have been able to support a distributed workforce and may, depending on conditions and health authority guidance, recommend our employees in the Netherlands and employees of our subsidiary, Merus US, Inc., in the U.S. work remotely. For those employees working at our offices and laboratory in Utrecht, they are required to follow requirements consistent with the guidance provided by the RIVM for the Netherlands, and employees of our subsidiary Merus US, Inc. are required to abide by the guidelines of the CDC, and Federal, state and local regulations for the U.S. While we use reasonable business practices to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 while on company-operated premises, we cannot guarantee that traveling to and from and visiting the office will not expose employees to infectious agents or eliminate inherent risks to our workforce and our business operations resulting from COVID-19. Given the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic we cannot be certain that we will not suspend our laboratory research activities at our facilities or suspend use of our offices in the future.

Employee Health and Wellbeing Support
 
Healthy and happy employees are important to us and therefore we have launched several initiatives to be able to support our employees with health and wellbeing. One of these initiatives is the option for employees that are experiencing financial difficulties on a personal level due to the current challenging economic circumstances, to get support from an external provider to get better insight in their financial situation and help them to set up a plan and/or take next steps to deal with these financial difficulties.
In addition, we offer our employees a medical check and/or a so-called fit-test to check-in and get advice on their overall health. We also offer our employees the option of a consult with an ergonomist to ensure their in-office workplace is correctly set up to limit the possibility of workplace related health issues from occurring.
Sustainability and Community Relations
 
At Merus, we want to play a positive role in society, not only by developing potentially meaningful medicines, but also by aiming to be responsible for the impact of our operations on the environment. To contribute to that goal, we have a sustainability team, comprised of members from different business functions throughout the organization. Since 2021, our sustainability team implemented Planet Tuesday at our company restaurant, introducing a weekly planet-friendly and healthy (vegetarian) menu. This tradition has continued as we have moved into a new building in December 2022, working with the on-premises catering company to continue to deliver vegetarian-only options daily. Our catering supplier aims to become climate neutral by 2024. To reach this goal, it plans to switch to more plant-based proteins, aims at reducing food waste, and looks for circular solutions for their waste streams, by reducing the use of plastic, choosing recyclable or compostable variants. Fruit and vegetables provided by our caterer are also locally sourced, reducing energy consumption expended in their transport.
We also have selected our coffee vendor for its sustainability practices, which uses techniques such as recirculation of heat in the coffee roasting process, to save up to 75% of energy expenditure, and uses 100% traceable Dutch wind energy. The roastery has a climate-resistant garden with rainwater infiltration. For carbon emissions that cannot be (yet) avoided, the supplier compensates through fairtrade carbon credits in the coffee chain. The supplier also aims to reduce waste: coffee beans are delivered in bulk in aluminum-free bags, and coffee machines are refurbished at the end of their lifecycle.
We have also implemented a sustainable mobility plan, which supports employees to purchase a new or second hand (e-)bike to commute to Merus, thereby reducing our carbon footprint, lowering city traffic, congestion, and improving the vitality of our employees. In June 2022, we held a sustainability competition at our headquarters in Utrecht, for all tenants of our multitenant office building. A member of the Merus sustainability team won second place with her idea to bring the brightness level of all computer monitors down to 60% to reduce energy consumption. On Earth Day 2022, our sustainability team organized a Merus Cleanup in Utrecht, collecting more than 40 kg of garbage, double the prior year's collection.
In 2022, we also donated 150 trees to Trees for All, on behalf of our employees, contributing to reforestation projects in Bolivia. This program supports local, sustainable agriculture projects and helps increase the income of farmers, while protecting and preserving nearby forest areas. Merus has contributed to this program since 2019, resulting in planting more than 400 trees during this time.
The "Accelerator": a New Sustainable Merus Utrecht Headquarters
 
In December 2022, we moved into our new headquarters called the "Accelerator" in the Utrecht Science Park, at 17 Uppsalalaan, 3rd and 4th floor, 3583 CT, Utrecht. As an anchor tenant, we have had the opportunity to have a significant role in the development of the building to provide Merus with a new premises that would be a sustainable and state-of-the-art facilities to continue to support our research, clinical and business activities.

During the development of the Accelerator building, our mission along with the developer and other anchor tenant was to produce a sustainable building, doing so by meeting the requirements of the so-called ‘BREEAM Excellent’ certification. BREEAM (Building Research Establishment’s Environmental Assessment Method) is a method to measure and assess the sustainability of real estate and is used in over 80 countries worldwide. The method was originally developed by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and the Dutch Green Building Council (DGBC) has adopted the method to make it align with the situation in The Netherlands, creating BREAAM-NL. There are specific BREAAM schemes for new buildings, existing (in-use) building and demolition to tailor the measurements and assessment to the relevant situation. BREEAM certifications are issued by the DGBC. BREEAM covers a variety of topics and processes, such as the management of the development/built process, a healthy internal building climate, energy efficiency, transport to, from and in the building, water usage and waste. The BREEAM certification achieved by the Accelerator is the second highest certification that can be obtained and represents high sustainability performance of the relevant building and the use of best practices in the market to build a building that meets this certification level. Only about 10% of all office buildings in the Netherlands a certified as ‘BREAAM Excellent.’ Since the Accelerator is a new building with unique characteristics, it was assessed based on a bespoke version of the BREAAM-NL New Build and Renovation scheme, which was specifically developed for the Accelerator. This scheme covers the following topics: management, health and comfort, energy, transport, water, materials, waste, use of the plot and ecology and pollution. In turn, these topics cover several elements. For example, management covers elements such as project design, life cycle costs and responsible building practices. Health covers visual and thermal comfort, safety, air quality and acoustics. Transport covers public transport access, mobility plan and maximum parking capacity. Materials cover the sustainability and durability of the materials used. To receive the BREEAM Excellence certification a building needs to have a minimum score of 70%. Based on the bespoke scheme used for the assessment of the Accelerator, the Accelerator scored 72.81% granting it a BREAAM Excellent certification. Certain notable sustainable features of the Accelerator include: (i) solar paneled roof to provide electrical power; (ii) heating and cooling provided by heat pump to avoid gas usage; (iii) LED lighting, including presence detection to avoid use of energy when spaces are vacant; and (iv) air handling units with energy recovery.
 As part of the BREEAM certification of the Accelerator, the landlord entered into a so-called green lease with each tenant, which provides requirements that need to be met by the tenants with regard to the design of the tenant’s premises and the use of the building. The green lease includes requirements concerning among others, heating/cooling, transport and lighting used in and around the building/tenant’s premises.
 In addition to the BREEAM certification and green lease and as part of the building permit, a mobility plan was developed specific for the Accelerator in support of the ambition of the Municipality of Utrecht to lower the number of car movements at the Utrecht Science Park and promote other means of transportation. As part of this mobility plan and our wish to contribute to a healthy and sustainable Utrecht Science Park and focus on employee well-being, we introduced the Merus Employee Cycling Plan in June 2021. As of January 1, 2023, 17 employees are participating in the Merus Employee Cycling Plan. In 2022, Merus has also provided NS business cards to over 40 employees, which enable our employees in the Netherlands to come to work through public transportation, reducing emissions and the impact of congestion in the Netherlands and the Utrecht Science Park.
 Further, we selected a sustainable supplier to assist with the interior fit-out of our new premises at the Accelerator, which built sustainable pantries, lockers and planters. Measures taken to enhance the sustainability of this construction include use of responsibly sourced materials (materials with FSC/PEFC certifications), with a preference for use of fast-growing, cultivated, non-tropical wood, use of responsible procurement of materials and recycling of components. Use of materials with FSC/PEFC certification, means that the origin of the product can be traced back to the source. Use of fast-growing, cultivated, non-tropical woods like poplar and pine provides greater control over the durability of materials as well as reducing the environmental impact of the transportation of purchased parts. Our supplier has also opted for heat-cold storage in their buildings, eliminating their dependency on fossil fuels for heating or cooling. Excess heat in summer is stored deep underground and used in the winter. There are also over 1,000 solar panels on the roof providing electricity all year long to their workshops and offices.

Environmental, Health and Safety Supplier Standards
 
We adopted the Merus Supplier Standards in September, 2021, to safeguard that our suppliers meet an acceptable standard business conduct and compliance with laws and regulations. These standards apply to all our non-GXP suppliers that provide products and/or services above a minimum threshold value, and to any sub-contractors of a supplier that are involved in the performance of any agreement between Merus and such supplier. For higher value contracts, the Supplier Standard form a condition precedent to soliciting bids and proposals from suppliers and are shared with the supplier for review and confirmation of compliance as part of the bid or proposal.
The Supplier Standards includes a range of standards which vary from compliance with law, privacy to fair competition and employment. In short, based on the Supplier Standards, we expect our suppliers (i) to fully comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (ii) to not have any involvement of any kind with or link to bribery or corruption and to abide by all applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, et seq. (FCPA) and UK Bribery Act 2010; (iii) to conduct business in a transparent way, keep their records accurate and not engage in or facilitate any form of money laundering; (iv) to use fair business practices and act in accordance with applicable antitrust laws; (v) to inform Merus in case of a (potential) conflict of interest; (vi) to respect the right to privacy of individuals, operate in a manner that is consistent with applicable data protection laws and process personal data provided by Merus with strict confidentiality and only when

having the appropriate technical and organizational structures and procedures in place to ensure the protection of the personal data; (vii) to uphold human rights, pay fair wages, respect rights of workers and to not use any forced or child labor of any sort; and (viii) to provide a safe and healthy environment and operate in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. Based on this section suppliers of Merus must also (i) comply with any applicable federal, state, (inter)national and local environmental and health & safety laws and regulations (which include but are not limited to rules on waste, air emissions and hazardous substances), obtain and maintain the required permits, licenses, authorizations and registrations and follow their operational and reporting requirements and restrictions; (ii) provide a healthy and safe workplace for its employees and other personnel; and (iii) operate in a socially and environmentally responsible manner and take measures to proactively protect and minimize the adverse impact of its business on the community, environment and natural resources, while safeguarding the health and safety of the public. Suppliers are encouraged to conserve natural resources, to avoid the use of hazardous materials where possible and to engage in activities that reuse and recycle.
Considering we had to engage several (new) suppliers in relation to the build of and operations at our new Merus Utrecht premises, sustainability and health and safety have been important points when selecting our suppliers. We believe such suppliers have been able to meet the aforementioned supplier standards, for example, by offering us sustainably sourced or produced products/services or products that are made of recycled materials to lower our impact on the environment and our community, and lower the use of natural resources.
