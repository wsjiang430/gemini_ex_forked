Item 1. Business
Overview
 Zevia PBC ("Zevia PBC") was incorporated as a Delaware public benefit corporation on March 23, 2021, and prior to the consummation of the reorganization described herein and our initial public offering (“IPO”), did not conduct any activities other than those incidental to our formation and the IPO. In connection with the completion of the IPO on July 26, 2021, Zevia PBC became a holding company, and its sole material asset is a controlling equity interest in Zevia LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Zevia LLC”). As the sole managing member of Zevia LLC, Zevia PBC operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Zevia LLC and, through Zevia LLC, conducts its business. Subsequent to July 26, 2021, Zevia PBC consolidates the results of Zevia LLC with a non-controlling interest reflected for the portion of Zevia LLC not owned by Zevia PBC.

 Our Business
 We are a high-growth beverage company that develops, markets, sells, and distributes great tasting, zero sugar beverages made with simple, plant-based ingredients. We are a Delaware public benefit corporation and have been designated as a “Certified B Corporation" by B Lab, an independent non-profit organization, and are focused on addressing the global health challenges resulting from excess sugar consumption by offering a broad portfolio of zero sugar, zero calorie, naturally sweetened beverages. All Zevia® beverages are Non-GMO Project verified, gluten-free, Kosher, vegan and zero sodium, We offer a variety of flavors across Soda, Energy Drinks, Organic Tea, Mixers, and Kidz drinks.
Our products are distributed and sold principally across the U.S. and Canada through a diverse network of major retailers in the grocery, drug, warehouse club, mass, natural, specialty outlets, and e-commerce channels. We believe consumers are increasingly seeking great tasting beverage options that are better-for-you which has benefited the Zevia® brand and resulted in over 1.6 billion cans of Zevia sold to date.
 ESG and Social Impact
 Our focus on ESG is core to how we conduct our business, and we believe this focus makes us a more successful company. We are dedicated to acting responsibly and strive to do our part in making the world a better place with every drink. We are committed to creating real ESG impact through combatting the harmful effects of sugar, reducing plastic waste, democratizing healthier lifestyles and fostering an employee-centric culture.
 As a public benefit corporation, we are guided by our mission to support the health of our consumers. Our products help consumers reduce their sugar intake and avoid artificial ingredients by offering a refreshing and enjoyable zero sugar, naturally sweetened alternative to high-sugar and artificially sweetened competitors. We estimate that by choosing Zevia, our consumers have eliminated over 66,000 metric tons of sugar in their diets since 2011.
Sustainable packaging is one of the top priorities for us and we actively seek to minimize our environmental impact. Since our founding in 2007, we have never sold a beverage in a plastic bottle. Through only using aluminum cans, we estimate that we have saved over 22,000 metric tons of plastic and eliminated one billion plastic bottles from littering our roadways, our waterways, and our communities since 2011. In addition, we reduce our use of packaging materials where possible. For example, we have eliminated both corrugate trays from our supply chain for our ten pack Soda items and plastic rings from our Canadian six pack Soda items, replacing those with a recyclable cardboard overwrap.


Our Brand
 The Zevia® brand promise is to offer delicious beverages that are better-for-you and better for the environment. We take pride in reducing plastic waste by using only aluminum cans as beverage containers. We market Zevia under one unified brand across multiple beverage categories, including Soda, Energy Drinks, Organic Teas, Mixers, and Kidz drinks. We believe our brand has extensive consumer reach potential, as we deliver beverage offerings with a diversity of flavors and categories that we believe appeal to every family member, time of day, and usage occasion. This is evidenced by our #1 brand ranking within carbonated soft drink brands in the Natural Channel according to SPINS, and our status as the #1 selling carbonated soft drink brand on Amazon in 2022 according to 1010data.
Our brand has grown significantly over the past decade, which has been largely tied to a dedicated and growing consumer base. In 2022, Zevia added 1.4 million more households to the brand and expanded purchasing options across new channels, such as warehouse club, with Zevia variety offerings that are designed to satisfy the entire household.
Our consumers are our best advocates and their loyalty is rooted in their alignment with our messaging and mission. Our consumer base over-indexes to Gen Z and Millennials, particularly among those starting families. We believe this consumer base favors better-for-you options that support a balanced lifestyle and that they are driven less by discounts than some other demographic groups. We believe Zevia consumers are heavily beverage engaged and migrate from other traditional full-calorie and low-calorie soda brands to including Zevia as an incremental beverage choice to aid in supporting their balanced lifestyle. We believe Zevia consumers care about their diets and their planet, and are willing to pay a premium for those attributes. Zevia drinkers have historically increased their brand spending over time, and tend to spend more on average than traditional shoppers within the soft drink, energy and ready-to-drink tea categories. According to Numerator data for the 12 months ending December 31, 2022, Zevia households increased their total spend on Zevia, purchased the brand more often, and spent more on the brand on every trip. Those households most engaged with the brand and purchasing multiple product lines increased their purchases even more, spending 2-3x more than the average for total Zevia households as they tried additional products across the Zevia portfolio.
Zero Sugar/Diet Sodas were a $19.6 billion Carbonated Soft Drinks ("CSD") segment in 2022, growing 18% since 2021 according to SPINS. This better-for-you CSD segment has consistently outpaced other beverage categories in recent years highlighting the shifting consumer preferences. According to Numerator, our household penetration of 6.4% during the year ended December 31, 2022 versus 5.3% in the year ended December 31, 2021 is low compared to 40% to 70% penetration, respectively, of full and low calorie category brand leaders in the same time periods, and we see a meaningful opportunity to grow by increasing our brand trial alone.
Our Products
 Since our founding in 2007, we have grown from three flavors of soda to a platform brand with multiple product lines that each have several flavor variations. Each of our product lines has been carefully crafted for consumer enjoyment, with the goal of ensuring that flavor is not sacrificed in the process of eliminating sugar and artificial ingredients, including coloring and flavors. In addition, continuous improvement is a Zevia core value, and as such we strategically reformulate our products from time to time to further enhance taste and simplify ingredients.
 Soda. Soda, our flagship product released in 2008, is the better-for-you alternative to conventional sodas and diet sodas with no artificial ingredients. Our Soda is available in 15 core flavors and annual limited-time-offer flavors to drive excitement. Our Soda sales constituted approximately 88% of our net sales in 2022.
 Energy. Energy drinks are zero sugar energy drinks that contain 120 mg of organic caffeine. We offer Energy in six flavors: Grapefruit, Kola, Mango Ginger, Raspberry Lime, Pineapple Paradise and Strawberry Kiwi. We released our Energy drinks in 2016.
 Mixers. Mixers are our non-alcoholic mixers that are meant to complement any cocktail or mocktail or can be enjoyed straight out of the can. We offer Mixers in three flavors: Ginger Beer, Tonic and Lemon Lime with Bitters. We released our Mixers in 2017.
 Organic Tea. Our Organic Tea is a pioneer in the zero calorie, naturally sweetened ready-to-drink tea segment, and was released in 2018. Zevia Organic Tea is USDA Organic and brewed with Fair Trade Certified Tea. We offer Organic Tea in eight flavors, including two caffeine-free options.
 Kidz. Kidz is our product line for kids, packaged in smaller cans for smaller hands, and the right size for lunch boxes and afternoon snacks. Our Kidz drinks are available in six kid-friendly flavors and were released in 2020.
 We benefit from sustained shifts across the liquid refreshment beverage market. We believe consumers are becoming more health conscious and focused on reducing sugar in their diets and are increasingly averse to added sugars. Many consumers are making choices with sustainability in mind, including plastic waste reduction. As a great-tasting, clean label beverage supporting a positive environmental and social impact, we are positioned to appeal to a broad range of consumer needs in our current markets and beyond.
 Consumers can purchase our products in both brick and mortar and e-commerce channels. We are an omnichannel brand found in more than 32,000 retailer locations across the traditional grocery, natural grocery, specialty outlets, warehouse club, and drug channels, and on e-commerce platforms.
Sales and Marketing and Consumer Outreach
 Our marketing strategy is to build brand awareness and drive product trial, targeting consumers as close to the point of purchase as possible, as we believe that many purchasing decisions are made in-store during the shopping experience. As such, we seek to deploy funding to enhance our presence at shelf, including shelf tags, product displays and other means to build consumer awareness. We also deploy marketing funds in-store, through advertising and couponing vehicles, and around the store via geotargeted digital advertising and offers. In addition, we seek to raise awareness of the Zevia® brand through advertising programs targeted to key lifestyle segments such as families and healthy lifestyle enthusiasts.
 In 2022, Zevia re-engaged its product sampling activities, with the goal of driving increased consumer awareness and product trial. We believe our product sampling activities both in-store and at sampling events outside of the store drive trial and are key to winning share of market and increasing our household penetration.


From a messaging perspective, we aim to create authentic content that focuses on Zevia’s taste experience—flavor, sweetness, bubbles and enjoyment—without the guilt that comes from drinking sugary or artificially sweetened beverages. We believe that combining our focus on taste with the positive ESG benefits of our brand—zero sugar, zero plastic, and products that are affordable to consumers across a broad range of income brackets—creates a compelling proposition that will drive both initial product trial and ongoing brand consumption.
 We are undertaking a number of initiatives to increase product trial and enhance brand messaging through awareness-building tactics, which include an improved approach to digital-first marketing, innovation, sampling, and expanding distribution. Our omnichannel approach engages with consumers over multiple touchpoints throughout their product discovery journey, stimulating trial, and leverages our brand awareness to grow cross-portfolio velocities and market share.
 We maintain a website at https://www.zevia.com, which serves as the most comprehensive source of information regarding our products. Our website is used as a platform to introduce our entire brand portfolio, promote and sell our products, provide news, share recipes, highlight nutritional facts and provide general information on where to purchase our products.
 We also use social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for online collaboration to support our brand awareness strategy. These platforms allow us to directly engage with our consumers and publish content related to our products, activities and Company and to better connect with potential and existing consumers.
 Sales
 As of December 31, 2022, our sales team is comprised of 26 people. The team works in close coordination with a national network of broker and distributor sales teams that gives us access to accounts across the U.S.
Innovation
 Innovation is an integral part of what we do. We regularly look for ways to improve product taste, expand our offerings across categories and usage occasions, improve the sustainability of our packaging formats and simplify our plant-based ingredients.
 Our product development team collaborates across our organization and supplier base to identify areas to improve our existing offerings and create new offerings. Our development team coordinates the creation, testing, launch and improvement of our products in collaboration with our suppliers. We employ in-house food scientists to help create the next iterations of our products.
 We have refined the formulas of our products to appeal to ensure they meet our shoppers’ evolving taste profile, and have launched line and flavor extensions within existing categories to further fulfill consumer needs. Our robust pipeline of new category innovations is expected to allow us to thoughtfully and strategically enter new segments within the beverage space and maximize share of stomach by offering flavors and beverages that can appeal to every family member.
 Our team is also working to improve our ingredients and packaging. Our main ingredient, after carbonated water, is stevia sweetener, which is extracted from the leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant, containing many different naturally-occurring sweet compounds called steviol glycosides (“SG”). Each specific SG has a unique taste perception property, and is present in the leaf at widely differing percentages, driving cost differences between high-content SGs and low-content SGs. We regularly refine our stevia blend in an effort to maintain leadership in our sweetener system and currently use a specific stevia extract product that contains a particular blend of SGs that was found to perform the best across our beverage platform, providing more rounded sweetness with minimal aftertaste commonly associated with other stevia sweeteners. In addition, we continue to evaluate and research alternate ingredients, including plant-based sweeteners other than stevia extract, that may meet or exceed our sensory and cost standards. We also assess how we can reduce our carbon footprint and plastic waste through our packaging. We believe that by consistently offering great tasting products that are all zero calorie and naturally sweetened, with sustainable packaging under one brand, we can attract consumers to our new flavors and categories.
 Our Supply Chain
 Our products are produced and distributed through an expansive supply network of third-party contract manufacturers, logistics providers and distribution centers. We have valuable, long-standing relationships across our supply chain, and we work closely with our external supply chain partners to try to maximize forward-looking capacity and take a thoughtful approach to how we can leverage our existing relationships with our innovation efforts.
 In the latter part of 2022, we implemented initiatives to transform our operations, including reducing our warehouse footprint to six U.S. and two Canadian warehouses that are aligned geographically and designed to optimize freight between our co-packers and customers, which will continue into 2023. We also ramped up repacking capabilities at seven of these eight facilities, utilizing automation where possible to rapidly deliver custom packs with regional efficiency. We also utilize a network of four consolidation locations to build more efficient freight into customers requiring full truckloads from multiple manufacturers. We periodically source freight lanes from carriers and freight brokers to help us manage costs, and seek to lock in rates for specified time periods. We continue to enhance utilization of our transportation management system to support tendering, management and costs associated with our freight and to get better visibility of delivery status.
 Ingredients and Ingredient Suppliers
 The principal ingredients of our beverages, aside from carbonated water, are stevia sweetener, flavors, and citric acid. All Zevia products are solely sweetened with highly purified stevia leaf extract. Zevia products do not contain erythritol. All Zevia beverages are zero sugar and naturally sweetened with plant-based ingredients that are Non-GMO Project verified. Our stevia extract is sourced through a multi-year supply agreement with a large multi-national ingredient company with international agriculture operations and substantial research and development capabilities. Although we do not view our stevia blend as a commodity ingredient, we are actively working to diversify sourcing to help de-risk supply and cost shocks from potential global disruptions. Our product development team provides ongoing sensory and cost evaluation of competing stevia extract products as well as other plant-based sweeteners as a means of planning alternate sources of supply that meet or exceed our sensory expectations.


Flavors are developed in collaboration with our product development team and our three flavor ingredient suppliers, as well as with our tea supplier. These suppliers produce and supply the unique flavor ingredients to our contract manufacturers. We do not have long-term supply agreements with these ingredient suppliers. For flavors and for our other ingredients, we continuously seek to diversify our sourcing strategies in order to de-risk potential ingredient supply interruptions.
 Packaging and Packaging Suppliers
 We have chosen aluminum beverage cans as our primary packaging containers, which have the highest recycling rate of any beverage packaging format and a low carbon footprint in the supply chain. We source beverage cans primarily through a major can manufacturer with whom we have a direct supply contract, as well as through contract manufacturers and opportunistic spot purchasing. As supply constraints on cans have eased over the past year, we have increased our focus on localized sourcing and copacker direct shipments.
Manufacturing and Supply Planning
 We have relationships with five contract manufacturers who operate our manufacturing facilities across the U.S. and Canada. We are reducing the number of specific manufacturing locations from 17 to nine to simplify our supply chain and build broader strategic partnerships. This includes a new copacker ramping up production in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. We expect to continue seeking out other potential partnerships that provide cost competitiveness, responsiveness, and geographic growth potential. We also multi-source package types where volumes allow to mitigate supply risk in the event of a disruption at a specific facility and to disperse production geographically to reduce freight miles driven to distribute our products. Our contracts are typically in the form of multi-year master service agreements that define overall commercial and legal terms, while volume forecasts, production costs and other services are typically re-evaluated annually or as needed. The majority of such agreements are pricing and volume-based forecasts rather than "take or pay"; however, we may tactically consider "take or pay" arrangements to improve assurance of supply for both co-pack volume and aluminum cans.
Quality Control
 Upon receipt of ingredients, we receive certifications from our suppliers in order to confirm that they meet our specifications. Contract manufacturers perform in-process quality checks common to the carbonated soft drink industry, throughout the manufacturing process. We provide beverage specifications for every unique formula, as well as Zevia-specific quality requirements to our manufacturers so that they comply with our unique needs.
 Zevia personnel also conduct a secondary layer of quality control checks to identify any potential quality discrepancies not reported or identified by our contract manufacturers, and to document their ongoing performance. Our quality team places specific inventory on hold at all inventory locations if either the contract manufacturer or our quality team identifies any suspected discrepancy, to allow for immediate investigation and corrective action if necessary.
 Distribution
 We believe we have created a meaningful flywheel for consumer acquisition in which shoppers are able to discover, learn about and purchase our brand online and offline across multiple channels and platforms. Our online platforms serve as trial generating and transaction intensification opportunities, allowing for full Zevia portfolio offerings, including our bestselling variety packs, which stimulate significant consumer engagement. In addition to helping Zevia maintain our status as the #1 total carbonated soft drink brand on Amazon, our e-commerce buyers are also heavily engaged with the brand offline. According to Numerator, 61% of Zevia shoppers who purchased us online in 2022 also purchased Zevia in brick-and-mortar retailers. Moreover, shoppers who bought Zevia products online spend 3.5x more on our brand across all channels on average.
Offline, we have strong, long-standing relationships with grocery, drug, warehouse club, mass, natural, and specialty retailers with whom we can grow distribution and sales through increased store penetration and shelf space. In 2022 we gained both overall store distribution and increases in items carried in these existing channels. We increased our store count by more than 1,100 locations versus 2021 according to SPINS and Nielsen data. We also increased the number of overall Zevia items carried across retailers, particularly with the introduction of Sleek cans for immediate consumption and larger packs that satisfied consumer needs for stocking up at home. We believe that our brick-and-mortar retailers value Zevia’s continued sales growth and margin profile with significant upside with both overall store count growth with major retailers and with expansion of items carried in each store.
Beyond these channels, we believe there is significant opportunity to continue expanding distribution and total item availability in the drug, warehouse club, and foodservice channels in order to be as present as possible where our shoppers are seeking to buy us.
Competition
 We believe we compete broadly with all categories of liquid refreshment beverages. The beverage industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based on brand recognition, taste, quality, price, ingredients, availability, selection and convenience, as well as factors related to corporate responsibility and sustainability. We believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. Our competitors in the beverage market include category leaders such as The Coca-Cola Company, Keurig Dr. Pepper, PepsiCo, Inc., National Beverage Corp., Monster Energy, and Red Bull, as well as a range of emerging brands.
Human Capital Resources
 Zevia’s passion to democratize healthier lifestyles – by providing affordable, better-for-you, naturally sweetened beverages without sugar or calories and never in plastic containers – is reflected in the organization’s people and culture. We offer a diverse, inclusive and challenging work environment comprised of team members who are representative of the communities we serve. Our core values - passion, respect, gratitude, learning, a positive attitude, teamwork, continuous improvement, and living our best, – are at the foundation of our strategies to drive our mission and business. In order for us to attract and retain the best talent, we have an inclusive, strategic and well-defined human capital planning process and a management approach that aligns to our business needs and mission.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 106 full-time team members in the United States, and 4 full-time team members in Canada. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. None of our team members is represented by a labor union. We maintain a strong relationship with our team members and have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.


Our Board of Directors provides oversight on certain human capital management matters, including through its Compensation Committee, which is responsible for governance over policies regarding human capital and compensation practices, including executive compensation, diversity and inclusion, pay equity, recruiting, retention, training and development, safety, and creating a working environment consistent with our culture, objectives and strategy.
 Employee Health and Safety during COVID-19
 As a values-driven organization, the health, safety and well-being of our team members is our top priority. We prioritize safety for all employees through a combination of education, training and safety-related policies, while also maintaining compliance with applicable regulations, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines and mandates by local health authorities. Specifically, we implement custom Injury and Illness Prevention Programs for our headquarters including safety training for medical emergencies, power failure, bomb threat, fire safety, earthquake, and evacuation prevention practices. Beginning in January 2023, our LA-based employees returned to work in our headquarters, and all employees were provided a flexible schedule of working in the office or remotely depending on job responsibilities, company need and performance. We also transformed our business communications to video conferencing as our preferred communication format to allow for flexibility and cross-functionality for all locations.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled, diverse executive leadership team and Board of Directors in terms of both gender and race, and representative by our Board of Directors and executive leadership team. We promote diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of our organization, and our senior leadership team has developed a diversity and inclusion framework that is centered on minimizing subjectivity via data-driven decisions to reduce the risk of bias and ensure that everyone owns responsibility for inclusive behaviors and actions across the organization.
Zevia promotes equity through consistency and fairness with our people policies and practices that offer access, opportunity, and career growth for all team members equally. We have best practice standards across all stages of the employee lifecycle, including performance standards. We strive to make promotions, compensation and growth opportunities are impartial, just and transparent. We offer a consistent compensation policy across base salary, bonus, equity and benefit contributions. Everyone is an owner at Zevia and we work together as one team to deliver results and achieve performance.
 Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") Taskforce, comprised of a diverse group of representatives from all levels of the organization, aims to give our team members a voice in DEI work and allows different perspectives to shape and hold accountable and transparent our people policies and practices. In partnership with our People team, the DEI Taskforce prioritizes topics related to the lifecycle of an employee's experience at Zevia and through a DEI lens, offers suggestions for improvement. Team members participate in the DEI Taskforce for approximately 12-months and regularly report on its work, priorities and accomplishments to the overall organization, to foster transparency and trust.
 Culture and Engagement
 Our team drives the success of our brand, and every leadership or full team engagement features a conscious effort to engage and communicate with a focus on our values. Our People team manages themes for contests, celebrations across diverse interests through the year, mental health resources, open surveys, team communication platforms, and training on resource access.
 In order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital objectives, we frequently utilize internal employee surveys to understand the effectiveness of our people programs and where we can improve across the organization. Our team also has access to participate in independent third-party surveys through Comparably.com, providing qualitative results that reported a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars for Company Culture, and 97 out of 100 for CEO Rating.
 In 2022, the Company was recognized with the following seven awards from Comparably.com, measured by anonymous employee surveys: 2022 Best Company Outlook, 2022 Best Company Los Angeles, 2022 Best Company Perks & Benefits, 2022 Best Company Compensation, 2022 Best Company Career Growth, 2022 Best CEOs for Diversity, 2022 Best CEOs for Women.
 Talent Acquisition
 We hired 44 new team members in 2022, 77% of which were sourced by internal recruitment. As part of our DEI initiative, we have implemented best-in-class recruitment practices to remove bias in the selection process and we reflect our values to candidates through job description language using gender-neutral pronouns, no video calls during the first interview, and standard assessments for applicable roles. We find candidates through a wide variety of sources to expand diversity, we offer flexible education requirements by role, and structure interviews with consistent processes to minimize bias. We conduct transparent, collaborative and panel interviews for group input on all hires.
Benefits and Compensation Strategies
 We strive to attract and retain diverse, high caliber individuals who raise the talent bar by offering competitive compensation and benefit packages, regardless of their gender, race or other personal characteristics. Our compensation program is designed to ensure our talented team is fairly paid and well rewarded for performance. The foundation of our compensation policy is a base salary and a performance-based bonus with targets tied to the Company’s annual financial performance. We regularly review and survey our compensation and benefit programs against the market to confirm we remain competitive in our hiring practices. We aim for equity and make conscious efforts to close the pay equity gap through market adjustments and new-hire offers considered with thorough and transparent analysis.
 Every full-time team member is eligible to receive equity-based compensation, which provides a sense of ownership and next-level engagement among employees at all levels. Zevia also offers a Fortune-500 style benefits package that incorporates a robust contribution for all tiers of coverage to include: medical, dental, vision, voluntary life & AD&D, critical illness, hospital indemnity, accident, short-term and long-term disability insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, pet insurance, legal access, and ID protection. We offer a 401(k) Safe Harbor Retirement savings plan with Company matching contributions and no vesting schedule. We have comprehensive paid time off and sick policies, paid bereavement, holidays, flexible schedules, remote work, employee assistance programs, and a generous parental leave policy.


Our policies apply worldwide, with competitive benefit packages for all team members consistently applied but tailored to market-specific practices.Training and Organizational Development
 Our team members have access to various internal and external formal training and development courses to support individual growth. We offer an annual professional development allowance for continued advancement, with focus on a team member’s career path at Zevia. We seek to promote from our internal talent pool as part of our enterprise-wide succession plan. Our internal trainings include custom trainings by department and role, 100% participation in DEI training, and management training and development. In 2022, we continued with our Zevia University initiative where we offer unlimited courses online for all levels of employees to enhance soft skills, professional acumen and discipline-specific skills. We had 80 total enrollments with 40% of those being new learners in 2022.
 Performance Management
 We are focused on setting clear and specific expectations for performance that align with individual strengths and company objectives. We believe in a customized approach, where high-performers are rewarded. Our managers also conduct90-day reviews for new hires, mid-year reviews to formally track performance, and annual reviews for all employees, goals management throughout the year via an online portal, incorporate short- and long-term career goals during each review, and conduct regular one-on-one sessions to provide feedback, coaching and support. Our approach is designed to foster accountability, transparency and recognition, which we believe drives both retention and high performance.
Seasonality
 As is typical in the beverage industry, sales of our beverages are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 We own domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business, including our principal trademark, Zevia®.

 Pursuant to the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), the FDA promulgated additional requirements to enhance food safety and prevent food contamination, including more frequent inspections and increased recordkeeping and traceability requirements. The FSMA also holds imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods. The FDA requires that certain nutrient and product information appear on product labels and that the labels and labeling be truthful, not misleading. Similarly, the FTC requires that marketing and advertising claims be truthful, not misleading, not deceptive to customers and substantiated by adequate scientific data. We are also restricted from making certain claims about our products, including health claims, claims that our products treat, cure, mitigate or prevent disease or claims regarding the effects of our products on the structure or function of the body except under certain limited circumstances.
 Products that do not comply with any governmental or third-party regulations and standards may be considered adulterated or misbranded and we may face adverse consequences, including but not limited to, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, import holds, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, civil law suits, or criminal prosecution.
 Various states, provinces and other authorities require deposits, eco-taxes or fees on certain products or packaging. Similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.
 We are also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers.
 In Canada, the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of our products are also subject to compliance with similar laws, rules and regulations.
