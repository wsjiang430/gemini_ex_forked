ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 22, 2013 under the name Lightcollar, Inc. On March 22, 2015, we changed our name to EMS Find, Inc. (“EMS Find”). Effective March 31, 2015, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with the sole shareholder of EMS Factory, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation (“EMS Factory”), and following the closing under the Share Exchange Agreement, EMS Factory became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with the former stockholder of EMS Factory owning approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company. The Company developed and marketed a B2B & B2C on-demand mobile platform, designed to connect health care providers and consumers to a network of medical transport companies. On April 6, 2016, we completed the sale of our subsidiary Viva Entertainment Group, Inc. to Black River Petroleum Corp.

Effective July 27, 2017, we changed our name to Integrated Ventures, Inc. to reflect our plan to expand our operations by the acquisition of additional operating companies. 

In November 2017, we discontinued our prior operations and changed our business focus to acquiring, launching and operating companies in the technology sector, mainly in digital currency mining, equipment manufacturing, and sales of branded mining rigs, as well as blockchain software development. 

In April 2018, the Company acquired the digital currency mining operations of digiMine LLC through two Asset Purchase Agreements. In addition, in August 2018, the Company acquired the digital currency mining operations of Secure Hosting, LLC through an Asset Purchase Agreement.

Our Business

On November 22, 2017, we successfully launched our cryptocurrency operations, and revenues commenced from cryptocurrency mining operations and from sales of cryptocurrency mining equipment. As of June 30, 2019, the Company owned and operated approximately 880 miners of cryptocurrencies. On May 8, 2019, the Company consolidated all of its mining operations by signing a three-year lease and power purchase agreement with PetaWatt Properties, LLC, located in upstate NY and moving all of our cryptocurrency operations to that new location. 
Cryptocurrency Mining

Digital tokens are built on a distributed ledger infrastructure often referred to as a “blockchain”. These tokens can provide various rights, and cryptocurrency is a type of digital token, designed a a medium of exchange. Other digital tokens provide rights to use assets or services, or in some cases represent ownership interests. Cryptocurrencies, for example Bitcoin, are digital software that run on a blockchain platform, which is a decentralized, immutable ledger of transactions, and essentially function as a digital form of money. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are not sponsored by any government or a single entity. A bitcoin is one type of an intangible digital asset that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security (the “Bitcoin Network”). The Bitcoin Network, for example, is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public transaction ledger, known as the “Blockchain,” and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. Bitcoins can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar, at rates determined on bitcoin exchanges or in individual end-user-to-end-user transactions under a barter system.

Bitcoins are “stored” or reflected on the digital transaction ledger known as the “blockchain,” which is a digital file stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network or as applicable to other cryptocurrency users. A blockchain records the transaction history of all bitcoins in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the cryptocurrency network to verify the association of each bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns them. The network and software programs can interpret the blockchain to determine the exact balance, if any, of any digital wallet listed in the blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the cryptocurrency network.

Mining is the process by which bitcoins, for example, are created resulting in new blocks being added to the blockchain and new bitcoins being issued to the miners. Miners engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the blockchain and thereby confirm cryptocurrency transactions included in that block’s data. Miners that are successful in adding a block to the blockchain are automatically awarded a fixed number of bitcoins for their effort. To begin mining, a user can download and run the network mining software, which turns the user’s computer into a node on the network that validates blocks.

All bitcoin transactions are recorded in blocks added to the blockchain. Each block contains the details of some or all of the most recent transactions that are not memorialized in prior blocks, a reference to the most recent prior block, and a record of the award of bitcoins to the miner who added the new block. Each unique block can only be solved and added to the blockchain by one miner; therefore, all individual miners and mining pools on the cryptocurrency network are engaged in a competitive process and are incentivized to increase their computing power to improve their likelihood of solving for new blocks.

The method for creating new bitcoins is mathematically controlled in a manner so that the supply of bitcoins grows at a limited rate pursuant to a pre-set schedule. Less than a year ago, Bitcoin moved to a price around $20,000 in December 2017, and is trading in the range of $10,000 currently. Mining economics have also been much more pressured by the Difficulty Rate – a computation used by miners to determine the amount of computing power required to mine bitcoin. The Difficulty Rate is directly influenced by the total size of the entire Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network has grown six-fold in the past year, resulting in a six-fold increase in difficulty. Meanwhile, demand from miners also drove up hardware and power prices, the largest costs of production. This deliberately controlled rate of bitcoin creation means that the number of bitcoins in existence will never exceed 21 million and that bitcoins cannot be devalued through excessive production unless the Bitcoin Network’s source code (and the underlying protocol for bitcoin issuance) is altered. 

Mining pools have developed in which multiple miners act cohesively and combine their processing power to solve blocks. When a pool solves a new block, the participating mining pool members split the resulting reward based on the processing power they each contributed to solve for such block. The mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the workers. Fees are paid to the mining pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members’ hashing power, identifies new block rewards, records how much work all the participants are doing, and assigns block rewards in-proportion to the participants’ efforts. While we do not pay pool fees directly, pool fees (approximately 2% to 5%) are deducted from amounts we may otherwise earn. Participation in such pools is essential for our mining business.

Our Cryptocurrency Operations

We utilize and rely on cryptocurrency pools to mine cryptocurrencies and generate a mixed selection of digital cryptocurrencies, including BTC, LTC and ETH. Cryptocurrency payouts are paid to us by the pool operator, and the digital currency produced is either stored in a wallet (Coinbase) or sold in open market. Payout proceeds are automatically deposited in our corporate bank accounts.

In our digital currency mining operations, the following models of miners are owned and deployed by the Company: Antminer S9 (5 different models), Antminer L3, Antminer E3, Alpha Miner, Panda Miner Pro and Bitworks. 

The Digital Currency Markets

The value of bitcoins is determined by the supply and demand of bitcoins in the bitcoin exchange market (and in private end-user-to-end-user transactions), as well as the number of merchants that accept them. However, merchant adoption is very low according to a Morgan Stanley note from the summer of 2018. As bitcoin transactions can be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network by any user’s bitcoin software and bitcoins can be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries or third parties, there are little or no transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions on the Bitcoin Network. Third party service providers such as crypto currency exchanges and bitcoin third party payment processing services may charge significant fees for processing transactions and for converting, or facilitating the conversion of, bitcoins to or from fiat currency.

Under the peer-to-peer framework of the Bitcoin Network, transferors and recipients of bitcoins are able to determine the value of the bitcoins transferred by mutual agreement, the most common means of determining the value of a bitcoin being by surveying one or more bitcoin exchanges where bitcoins are publicly bought, sold and traded, i.e., the Bitcoin Exchange Market (“Bitcoin Exchange”). 

On each Bitcoin Exchange, bitcoins are traded with publicly disclosed valuations for each transaction, measured by one or more fiat currencies. Bitcoin Exchanges report publicly on their site the valuation of each transaction and bid and ask prices for the purchase or sale of bitcoins. Market participants can choose the Bitcoin Exchange on which to buy or sell bitcoins. To date, the SEC has rejected the proposals for bitcoin ETF’s, citing that lack of enough transparency in the cryptocurrency markets to be sure that prices are not being manipulated. The Wall Street Journal has recently reported on how bots are manipulating the prices of bitcoin on the crypto exchanges. However, on November 8, 2018, the SEC announced in an order (the "Order") that it had settled charges against Zachary Coburn, the founder of the digital token exchange EtherDelta, marking the first time that the SEC has brought an enforcement action against an online digital token platform for operating as an unregistered national securities exchange.

Although the cryptocurrency markets have been historically volatile and have weathered several up and down cycles over the past few years, recently these markets have been in a selloff phase for the past several months, possibly reflecting doubts as to the applicability of digital currencies in commercial applications and other factors. In this selloff, prices of digital currencies other than Bitcoin have experienced deeper percentage declines than Bitcoin. On December 31, 2017, Bitcoin was trading in the range of $18,000, and as of November 30, 2018 had declined to a $4,000 trading range. The trading range has recently increased to approximately $10,200. Other cryptocurrencies have experienced more substantial declines, than Bitcoin’s recent decline. Our revenues are directly affected by the Bitcoin market price specifically, which is the market leader for prices of all cryptocurrencies. In recent weeks, regulatory crackdowns have also weighed on prices. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently announced its first civil penalties against cryptocurrency founders as part of a wide regulatory and legal crackdown on fraud and abuses in the industry. In addition, Bloomberg News recently reported that regulators are investigating whether bitcoin's rally to almost $20,000 last year was the result of market manipulation. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether tether, a controversial cryptocurrency that founders say is backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar, was used by traders to prop up bitcoin, according to the report, which cited three unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

  Competition

In cryptocurrency mining, companies, individuals and groups generate units of cryptocurrency through mining. Miners can range from individual enthusiasts to professional mining operations with dedicated data centers, with all of which we compete. Miners may organize themselves in mining pools, with which we would compete. The Company currently participates in mining pools and may decide to invest or initiate operations in mining pools. At present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises is not readily available as the vast majority of the participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. 
Government Regulation

Government regulation of blockchain and cryptocurrency under review with a number of government agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and in other countries. State government regulations also may apply to certain activities such as cryptocurrency exchanges (bitlicense, banking and money transmission regulations) and other activities.  Other bodies which may have an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency business include the national securities exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, the Company may in its mining activities become subject to new laws, and further regulation by the SEC and other agencies.  On November 16, 2018, the SEC issued a Statement on Digital Asset Securities Issuance and Trading, in which it emphasized that market participants must still adhere to the SEC’s well-established and well-functioning federal securities law framework when dealing with technological innovations, regardless of whether the securities are issued in certificated form or using new technologies, such as blockchain.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations are in a nascent state with agencies investigating businesses and their practices, gathering information, and generally trying to understand the risks and uncertainties in order to protect investors in these businesses and in cryptocurrencies generally.   Various bills have also been proposed in Congress for adoption related to our business which may be adopted and have an impact on us.  The offer and sale of digital assets in initial coin offerings, which is not an activity we expect to pursue, has been a central focus of recent regulatory inquiries.  On November 16, 2018 the SEC settled with two cryptocurrency startups, and reportedly has more than 100 investigations into cryptocurrency related ventures, according to a codirector of the SEC’s enforcement division (Wall Street Journal, November 17-18, 2018). An annual report by the SEC shows that digital currency scams are among the agency’s top enforcement priorities. The SEC is focused in particular on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which involve the sale of digital tokens related to blockchain projects. Many such projects have failed to deliver on their promises or turned out to be outright scams. In the past year, the enforcement division has opened dozens of investigations involving ICOs and digital assets, many of which were ongoing at the close of FY 2018,” the SEC states in a section of the report titled “ICOs and Digital Assets.”

Financial

For the year ended June 30, 2019, we have recognized revenues totaling $279,143 from cryptocurrency operations (consisting of both mining and equipment sales transactions) which commenced November 22, 2017. At June 30, 2019, we owned no material mined intangible assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin). 

At June 30, 2019, the Company owned 880 mining rigs, with a net book value of $1,078,206 with no rigs included in inventory and held for sale. This number is directly related to the availability of the electric power for the mining rigs, which is currently at maximum utilization capacity. For financial accounting purposes, we record our mining rigs at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. 

On April 16, 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with digiMine LLC (“digiMine”) for the purchase of certain digiMine digital currency mining assets located in Marlboro, New Jersey, the principal assets consisting of: 150 cryptocurrency mining machines; and restricted cash of $175,000. The Company issued 16,666 shares of its Series B preferred stock to digiMine for these assets. On April 30, 2018, the Company entered into a second Asset Purchase Agreement with digiMine for the purchase of additional digital currency mining assets from digiMine at the same location, the principal assets consisting of: 97 cryptocurrency mining machines and restricted cash of $200,000. The Company issued 20,000 shares of its Series B preferred stock to digiMine in this transaction.

On May 21, 2019, the Company and DigiMine, LLC entered into an Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which, DigiMine had agreed to surrender the remaining 20,000 shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock held by it and terminate its Put-Back-Rights under the April 2018 Security and Pledge Agreements, in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, which issued in ten tranches of 1,000,000 shares each. Ten trading days after the Initial Closing date and each ten trading days thereafter, the Company agreed to deliver a tranche of 1,000,000 shares of common stock to the Holder. Through June 30, 2019, closings were held and 2,000,000 shares of the common stock exchange shares were issued.

On August 2, 2018, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Secure Hosting, LLC ("Secure Hosting") for the purchase of 182 Ethereum mining machines. As consideration for the purchase of the machines, the Company issued 38,018 shares of its Series B convertible preferred stock. 

On January 19, 2018, Integrated Ventures, Inc. and St. George Investments, LLC entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which St. George purchased 462,900 restricted common shares of the Company for $750,000. The Company received net proceeds of $720,000. The Company had issued to St. George, a three-year warrant (the Warrant) for the purchase of 347,175 shares of the Company’s common stock at a cash exercise price of $2.16 per share. The Warrant also contained a cashless exercise option. On June 26, 2019, the Company and St. George executed an Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which the Company issued a new Convertible Promissory Note, in the original principal amount of $500,000, in exchange for the surrender by St. George of the Warrant. The Note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum and matures six months from the issuance date. St. George shall have the right, exercisable at any time in its discretion, to convert any amount of the Note and accrued interest into common shares of the Company at an exercise price equal to 80% multiplied by the average of the three lowest closing trade prices of the Company’s common stock during the twenty trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion date. The Company has the right to prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the Note.

Additional Capital Requirements

To continue to operate, complete and successfully operate our digital currency mining facilities and to fund future operations, we may need to raise additional capital for expansion or other expenses of operations. The amount and timing of future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and results of our ongoing mining operations, and potential new development and administrative support expenses. We anticipate that we will seek to fund our operations through our cryptocurrency mining operations, further liquidation of our marketable securities, public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements. If additional financing is required, we cannot be certain that it will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
Employees and Employment Agreements

At present time, we have one full time employee, Steve Rubakh, our sole officer and director, who devotes 100% of his time to our operations. In addition, we rely on a group of subcontractors to build, install, manage, monitor and service our mining equipment. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers, directors or employees; however, we at times do reimburse Mr. Rubakh for certain health insurance and medical costs.
Property

Our corporate offices are located at 73 Buck Road, Suite 2, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania 19006. Our telephone number is (215) 613-1111. Our lease provides for a monthly rental of $750 and is currently on a month-by-month basis. The lease will continue month-to-month after the expiration. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate and that we have sufficient capacity to meet our current anticipated needs. This facility is also used by mining operations.

On May 8, 2019, the Company consolidated all of its mining operations in Carthage, New York, by signing a three-year lease and power purchase agreement with PetaWatt Properties, LLC, based in upstate NY.
