Item 1.        BUSINESS
General 
General Development of the Business
NCR Corporation (“NCR”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) was originally incorporated in 1884 and is a software- and services-led enterprise technology provider that runs stores, restaurants and self-directed banking for our customers, which includes businesses of all sizes. NCR is a global company that is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Our software platform, which runs in the cloud and includes microservices and APIs that integrate with our customers' systems, and our NCR-as-a-Service solutions bring together all of the capabilities and competencies of NCR to power the technology to run our customers’ operations. Our portfolio includes digital first software and services offerings for banking, retailers and restaurants, as well as payments processing and networks, multi-vendor connected device services, automated teller machines (“ATMs”), self-checkout (“SCO”) kiosks and related technologies, point of sale (“POS”) terminals and other self-service technologies. We also resell third-party networking products and provide related service offerings in the telecommunications and technology sector. Our solutions are designed to support our transition to becoming a software platform and payments company.
NCR has grown organically, as well as through acquisitions, to add software, services and other capabilities that complement or enhance our existing offer portfolio, including, but not limited to, acquisitions relating to payments and cryptocurrency, digital banking, ATM-as-a-Service, and commerce platform offerings. NCR continuously evaluates potential acquisitions and develops new solutions intended to support the Company’s long-term strategy. In 2021, NCR completed the acquisition, among others, of Cardtronics plc (“Cardtronics”) to accelerate our NCR-as-a-Service strategy adding the Allpoint debit network, which is highly complementary to our payments platform and enables us to connect retail and bank customers. In early 2022, NCR completed the acquisition of LibertyX, with the goal of enabling NCR to provide a complete digital currency solution, including the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrency, conduct cross-border remittance, and accept digital currency payments across digital and physical channels.
NCR’s reputation is founded upon over 139 years of providing quality products, services and solutions to our customers. At the heart of our customer and other business relationships is a commitment to acting responsibly, ethically and with the highest level of integrity. This commitment is reflected in NCR’s Code of Conduct, which is available on the Corporate Governance page of our website.
NCR Corporation’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “NCR.”

Our Strategy
In order to provide long-term value to all our stakeholders, we set complementary business goals and financial strategies. NCR is continuing its transition to become a software platform and payments company with a shift to a higher level of recurring revenue. Our business goal is to be a leading enterprise technology provider that runs stores, restaurants and self-directed banking through our software platform and our NCR-as-a-Service solutions. By helping our customers run stores, restaurants and banks better, they have more time to create customer experiences that drive lasting success. 
Additionally, on September 15, 2022, NCR announced a plan to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies – one focused on digital commerce, the other on ATMs. The separation is intended to be structured in a tax-free manner. The separation transaction will follow the satisfaction of customary conditions, including effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the completion of audited financial statements. The current target is to complete the separation by the end of 2023. Should alternative options become available in the future that could deliver superior value to our shareholders than the planned separation, such as a whole or partial company sale of NCR, the Board remains open to considering alternative scenarios. Additional details are included in Part II, Item 7 “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Execution of our business goals and financial strategies is driven by the following key pillars:
•Focus on our customers. We encourage our employees to treat every customer as if they are our only customer. If we provide better service and better quality products than our competitors, it is our belief that our customers will likely buy more from NCR. We are increasingly becoming active, strategic advisors to our clients, helping them retool and reinvent their business, and this is reflected in a significant increase in our Net Promoter Score, a measure of customer experience, from 14 in 2018 to 52 in 2022. We believe this focus has and will lead to increased access to higher level customer contacts, earlier entrance into the sales cycles, and additional opportunities for upselling and cross-selling as a software- and services- led company.
•Take care of our employees. Our employees are the direct face of NCR to our clients. NCR has actively worked to increase employee engagement and satisfaction, as well as to create a culture of performance and innovation focused on software and services.
•Bring high-quality, innovative products to market. NCR focuses its research and development investments on elevating product quality and bringing new solutions to market in our key focus areas of digital banking, our next-generation retail architecture, including our NCR EmeraldTM cloud-based point of sale product, our AlohaTM Essentials solution bundle, and payments and self-service banking solutions. Additionally, we have placed an increasing priority on improvements in how we go to market with NCR-as-a-Service, as well as how we package and deliver our solutions as all-in-one bundles designed around a software platform, making it easier for our customers to buy and for our teams to sell.
•Leverage our brand. We believe NCR has one of the best-known and respected brands in the industries we serve. We consider this to be a strong competitive differentiation with significant equity in our worldwide markets.

Target Markets and Distribution Channels 
NCR provides solutions to customers of varying sizes in the retail, hospitality, financial, and telecommunications and technology (“T&T”) industries. 
We provide the technology that helps customers run self-directed banking, which primarily centers around our digital banking and ATM businesses, including software and services, as well as our Allpoint retail-based and surcharge-free ATM network. Our solutions also serve the retail markets through convenience banking products for retailers designed to complement their core businesses. Our financial solutions customers are located throughout the world in both developed and emerging markets. We have historically sold the majority of our Digital Banking, Payments & Network and Self-Service Banking segment solutions through a direct sales channel, and have augmented our presence through distributors and value-added resellers.
We provide solutions to the retail and hospitality industries that run the store and run the restaurant including, but not limited to, POS software and hardware, SCO software and hardware, loyalty software, supply chain and payment solutions. We also provide store virtualization, Internet of Things (IoT), and micro-services platform solutions to modernize store and restaurant IT infrastructure.

We provide service and support for our products and solutions through services contracts with our customers. We have also established managed services contracts with key customers and continue to pursue additional managed services relationships. We believe that longer term managed services arrangements can help improve the efficiency and performance of a customer’s business, and also increase the strategic and financial importance of its relationship with NCR. We also service competing technologies and third-party products. The primary sales channel for our services is our direct sales teams, which exist across all geographies where we operate around the world. Our services professionals provide these services directly to end customers.
Competition 
We face a diverse group of competitors in the financial, retail, hospitality and other industries, including the T&T industry, in which we sell our digital-first portfolio of software, services and hardware. The primary competitive factors can vary by geographic area where we operate around the world, but typically include: value and quality of the solutions or products; total cost of ownership; industry knowledge of the vendor; the vendor’s ability to provide and support a total end-to-end solution; the vendor’s ability to integrate new and existing systems; fit of the vendor’s strategic vision with the customer’s strategic direction; and quality of the vendor’s consulting, deployment and support services.
In the financial industry, our Digital Banking, Payments & Network and Self-Serve Banking segments face a variety of competitors offering financial services and software including, among others, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Q2 Holdings, Inc., Temenos AG, Infosys Ltd., Alkami Technology, Inc. and ACI Worldwide, Inc. In addition, we face competition from ATM manufacturers including Diebold Nixdorf, Inc. and Hyosung TNS Inc., and ATM network operators including Euronet Worldwide, Inc., as well as regional firms across all geographies where we operate around the world.
In the retail and hospitality industries, our Retail and Hospitality segments face a variety of competitors across all geographies where we operate around the world. Our competitors vary by market segment, product, service offering and geographic area, and include Toshiba Tec Corporation, Flooid, Oracle Corporation, GK Software SE, PAR Technology Corporation, Olo Inc., Aptos, Inc., Lightspeed, Diebold Nixdorf, Inc., Fujitsu Limited, SAP and HP Inc., among others. In addition, we face new competitors including Toast, Inc., Revel Systems, Inc., Square, Inc., and Upserve, Inc., among others. 
The primary services competitors are the companies identified above, as well as other regional and local independent services firms across all geographies where we operate around the world. We also face services competition from global enterprise technology companies including IBM Corporation, and CompuCom (owned by Variant Equity Advisors) among others, as these firms continue to focus on services as a core business strategy.
Research and Development 
We remain focused on designing and developing solutions that anticipate our customers’ changing technological needs as well as consumer preferences. Our expenses for research and development were $217 million in 2022, $268 million in 2021, and $234 million in 2020. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future in order to provide a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services and to help maintain and enhance our competitive position. Information regarding the accounting and costs included in research and development activities is included in Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report under "Research and Development Costs," and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Patents and Trademarks 
NCR seeks patent protection for its innovations (including improvements), associated with its software, services, product, solutions, creations and developments (including hardware), where such protection is likely to provide, especially strategic value to NCR. NCR owns approximately 1,350 patents in the United States and numerous other patents in foreign countries. The foreign patents are generally counterparts of NCR’s United States patents. Many of the patents owned by NCR are licensed to others, and NCR is licensed under certain patents owned by others. As appropriate, NCR looks to monetize its patents to drive additional value from its patent portfolio. NCR also has numerous patent applications pending in the United States and in foreign countries. NCR’s portfolio of patents and patent applications is of significant value to NCR. 
NCR has registered certain trademarks, including service marks, in the United States and in foreign countries. NCR considers the “NCR” and NCR logo marks, as well as its other trademarks (including service marks), to have significant value to NCR. Loss of NCR’s right to use the NCR trademark could be material. However, the NCR trademark has been used and owned by NCR for at least 100 years, and NCR expects to maintain its rights in and to the NCR trademark for years to come.
Seasonality 
Our sales have been historically seasonal, with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year. Such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on variability in the volume, timing and mix of sales. In addition, revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months. However, with the transition of our revenue mix to comprise a higher mix of recurring software and services revenue, we expect that our sales will continue to become more linear over time.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials 
In most cases, there are a number of vendors providing the services and producing the parts and components that we utilize. However, there are some services and components that are purchased from single sources due to price, quality, technology or other reasons. In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and components for virtually all materials used in the production process. We currently believe we have adequate resources of raw materials and components and that our portfolio of vendors providing services and producing parts has the resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply. 
As of December 31, 2022, NCR leverages a network of internal and third-party partner facilities across the globe to manufacture its products in Chennai, India and partner facilities located in Budapest, Hungary, Guadalajara, Mexico, Chihuahua, Mexico, and Xiamen, China. 
Further information regarding the potential impact of these relationships on our business operations, and regarding sources and availability of raw materials, is also included in Item 1A of this Report under the caption “Business Operations,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Product Backlog 
Backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped as well as certain professional and transaction services to be provided. Although we believe that the orders included in the backlog are firm, we may allow some orders to be canceled by the customer without penalty. Even when penalties for cancellation are provided for in a customer contract, we may elect to permit cancellation of orders without penalty where management believes it is in our best interests to do so. Further, we have a significant portion of product revenue derived from term-based software license arrangements that include customer termination rights and services revenue that is recurring or transaction based business, which backlog information has not historically been measured. Therefore, we do not believe that our backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of revenue for any future period. 
However, backlog is included as a component of our remaining performance obligation to the extent we determine that the orders are non-cancelable. Refer to Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information on remaining performance obligations.
Risk Management
At the Board of Directors level, NCR has a standing Risk Committee. The Risk Committee assists NCR’s Board of Directors with its oversight of executive management’s responsibilities to design, implement and maintain an effective enterprise risk management (“ERM”) framework for the Company’s overall operational, information security, strategic, reputational, technology, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”), and other risks. The Risk Committee also assists the Board of Directors with its oversight responsibilities for matters relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”), environment, health and safety (“EHS”), sustainability, and the security of our personnel and physical assets. At the management level, NCR's Office of Risk Management and Chief Risk Officer assist NCR and the Risk Committee in fulfilling its objectives relating to ERM, ESG, third-party risk management (“TPRM”) and business continuity planning (BCP). The Company’s Chief Risk Officer is responsible for developing and managing formal ERM, ESG, TPRM and BCP programs designed to identify, assess and respond to material and emerging risks and opportunities that may impact the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives. NCR has also established an Executive Risk Committee that meets routinely to monitor material risks, opportunities and NCR's response plans thereto.
ESG
At NCR, we remain committed to creating positive change that supports an innovative and sustainable future in a responsible way. Our NCR business strategy directly aligns with the ESG priorities that we established in 2020. The NCR business strategy is dependent on customer satisfaction and harnessing our culture of innovation. NCR’s focus on customer satisfaction is two-fold: we intend to represent the ESG qualities our customers are looking for; and we intend for our employees to fulfill and answer these expectations. 
ESG Oversight. NCR is committed to a strong oversight mechanism of ESG issues. NCR’s Board of Directors has direct oversight of ESG activities through its Risk Committee. The Risk Committee and other Board committees oversee components of ESG, including, business ethics and integrity, data protection, privacy and security, our people, DE&I, environmental management, product innovation and management, and supplier responsibility.
Business Ethics and Integrity. Our Code of Conduct sets forth standards designed to uphold our values and foster integrity in our relationships with one another and our valued stakeholders. Our Code of Conduct is available at https://www.ncr.com/company/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct.
Everyone at NCR is required to annually take our Code of Conduct training, available in 17 languages. Since 2008, NCR has achieved 100% timely completion of its Code of Conduct training. The Code of Conduct training is revised annually, taking into account the prior year’s compliance matters and the Company’s compliance risks. 
Our Ethics and Compliance Program is responsible for managing the Company’s adherence to the Code of Conduct. Further, our Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer oversees investigations pertaining to fraud, conflicts of interest, violations of laws, and other similar matters, and reports on those activities to one or more Committees of the Board.
Data Protection, Privacy and Security. At NCR, we are proud of our data protection, cybersecurity, and privacy programs. These initiatives receive oversight from the Board’s Risk Committee, as well as several members of our executive leadership team including the Chief Operations Officer, General Counsel, Chief Security Officer, and Chief Information Officer. NCR’s Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer are responsible for management of these programs. Additional support is provided by our Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer. 
NCR supports appropriate privacy protections for those with whom we interact. We foster a culture that values the privacy rights of individuals. Under the direction of NCR’s Chief Privacy Officer, the program offers thought leadership, advice and guidance on privacy practices such as: complying with privacy laws and regulations; designing solutions with privacy in mind; implementing contracts governing intracompany activities; minimizing the collection of data; providing meaningful notice and choice; and safeguarding information. The program is supported by privacy attorneys, privacy program managers within the business, and data protection officers in various locations internationally. Many of these privacy professionals have industry recognized privacy certifications from the International Association of Privacy Professionals. 
Under the direction of NCR’s Chief Security Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, the Global Information Security organization is responsible for implementing and maintaining an information security program with the goal to protect information 
technology resources and protect the confidentiality and integrity of data gathered on our people, partners, customers, and business assets. Also, we employ various information technology and protection methods designed to promote data security including firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, denial of service detection, anomaly-based detection, anti-virus/anti-malware, endpoint encryption and detection and response software, Security Information and Event Management system, identity management technology, security analytics, multi-factor authentication and encryption. 
To further our commitment to data privacy and cybersecurity: 
•NCR maintains the ISO 27001 certification for certain NCR locations throughout the United States, Europe, and India 
•Third-party audits for PCI-DSS, PA-DSS and SSAE-18 SOC2 are conducted for certain service offerings 
•NCR maintains a robust information security awareness and training program. Employees and contingent workers are required to complete training within 30 days of hire, as well as an annual refresher course. Additionally, NCR performs regular testing to help ensure employees can identify email “phishing” attacks 
•NCR’s corporate insurance policies include certain information security risk policies that cover network security, privacy and cyber events 
•Our NCR Privacy Policy can be found on the Company website for further viewing at https://www.ncr.com/privacy 
Our People. At NCR, we believe that investment in our employees has a positive impact on our employees and our customers. We put that into action with several employee development and engagement programs, including those described under the caption “Human Capital Resources” in Item 1 of this Report.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I). NCR believes in the power and value of diversity and strives to build a globally inclusive workplace where all people are treated fairly. We seek to include everyone, lead with empathy, and make our communities better. We encourage IDEAS (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Allyship, and Storytelling) and seek to inspire each other to be our authentic selves. The Board of Directors and its Risk Committee have direct oversight of our DE&I activities, including those described under the caption “Human Capital Resources” in Item 1 of this Report.
Environmental Management. We are committed to managing our environmental footprint and protecting the global communities in which we operate. We strive to minimize the environmental impact of our products and operations while also delivering innovative technologies and solutions designed to support businesses and consumers in their efforts to operate responsibly. We also recognize the importance of minimizing our environmental footprint through energy and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) management. That is why we have committed to Net Zero GHG emissions by 2050 and continue to report our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our global facilities and service operations through the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project). We complete the annual CDP climate change questionnaire and evaluate our environmental management progress annually to better understand our areas of opportunity to make a true impact.
Our commitment to environmental management extends into our products and operational footprint. Our manufacturing facility in Chennai, India maintains the ISO 14001 certification. The NCR Global Headquarters in Midtown Atlanta has been awarded two Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) Platinum certifications: 1) Building Design and Construction: Core & Shell and Interior Design; 2) Construction: Commercial Interiors. Our newest office in Belgrade, Serbia is also LEED platinum certified. 
Product Innovation and Management. Delivering solutions and services that provide value to our customers in an environmentally responsible way is critical to NCR’s ongoing success. As such, we strive to develop, and recycle our products in a responsible way. One example of how we are already doing this is that certain of our applications, such as Intelligent Deposit and Self-Service Diagnostic Gateway (SSDG), enable our SelfServ ATM customers to better handle the increasing volume – cutting down on costs, maintenance, fuel and materials associated with them.
Supplier Responsibility. We believe in creating positive change responsibly, and our supplier partners play a critical role in bringing that vision to life. We not only expect high quality products and services from our suppliers, we also expect them to conduct their businesses consistent with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Our Supplier Code of Conduct, available at https://www.ncr.com/company/suppliers/manuals-forms-and-templates, sets forth our expectation that our suppliers will meet ethical standards consistent with NCR’s Code of Conduct and policies. 
As part of our overall ERM approach, our TPRM program is designed to ensure proper risk identification and oversight of NCR’s vendors and includes the following objectives:
•Perform risk-based segmentation and prioritization of all existing and new NCR vendors 
•Perform sanctions screenings on all vendors and anti-bribery, anti-corruption (“ABAC”) screenings on applicable vendors 
•Perform extended due diligence on identified high risk vendors to include responsible sourcing, business continuity, information security, data privacy, and other reviews as applicable 
•Perform Financial Risk Assessment on identified high risk vendors
Additionally we take a risk-based approach to supply chain due diligence. We engage with the majority of our largest suppliers on a quarterly basis to identify potential risk exposure. As part of our supplier partner onboarding process, supplier partners are required to certify compliance with International Electrotechnical Commission 62474 standards. NCR requires its supplier partners to maintain compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation, and other applicable regulations.
Human Capital Resources
NCR continued its rich legacy of prioritizing investment and focus on human capital resources in 2022. We found ways to adapt to a rapidly changing labor market and continued to build a diverse, talented workforce that aligned to our Customer-FIRST values, motivated to Transform, Connect and Run the world of commerce.

NCR is subject to a variety of evolving government laws and regulations, including those related to environmental protection, in the various jurisdictions in which NCR operates or its products are sold, or where our offerings are used, including, for example, privacy and data protection laws, regulations and directives, and anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United Kingdom Bribery Act. In addition, though not material to our business taken as a whole, certain parts of NCR’s operating segments are subject to industry-specific laws and regulations. For example our digital banking business is subject to examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC); portions of our payments-related business are subject to or contractually obligated to comply with certain anti-money laundering laws and regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act and their international counterparts; portions of certain businesses NCR recently acquired are customer-facing and may be subject to certain consumer protection requirements such as oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and similar state or foreign agencies in the jurisdictions where they operate; and portions of certain businesses NCR recently acquired are subject to a number of foreign, federal and state licensing requirements including money transmission, money services and virtual currency, which may be subject to regulatory changes in the future in the jurisdictions where they operate. 
Although NCR does not currently expect that compliance with government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations and those designated to address climate risk, will have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, cash flow, financial condition, earnings and competitive position of NCR, its segments or its subsidiaries, it is possible that such compliance could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, cash flow, financial condition, earnings or competitive position, including, but, not limited to, as NCR's Banking or Payments-related businesses grow or change as NCR continues to implement its business strategy. Further, while NCR does not currently expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with such laws and regulations, and while we believe the amounts provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities in this area, there can be no assurances that environmental matters will not lead to a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. A detailed discussion of the current estimated impacts of compliance issues relating to environmental regulations, particularly the Fox River, Kalamazoo River and Ebina matters, is reported in Item 8 of Part II of this Report as part of Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Further information regarding the potential impact of compliance with governmental laws and regulations is also included in Item 1A of this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
