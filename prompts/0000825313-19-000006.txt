Retail
We provide investment management and related services to a wide variety of individual retail investors, both in the U.S. and internationally, through retail mutual funds we sponsor, mutual fund sub-advisory relationships, separately-managed account programs (see below), and other investment vehicles (“Retail Products and Services”).
We distribute our Retail Products and Services through financial intermediaries, including broker-dealers, insurance sales representatives, banks, registered investment advisers and financial planners. These products and services include open-end and closed-end funds that are either (i) registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act (“U.S. Funds”), or (ii) not registered under the Investment Company Act and generally not offered to U.S. persons (“Non-U.S. Funds” and, collectively with the U.S. Funds, “AB Funds”). They also include separately-managed account programs, which are sponsored by financial intermediaries and generally charge an all-inclusive fee covering investment management, trade execution, asset allocation, and custodial and administrative services. In addition, we provide distribution, shareholder servicing, transfer agency services and administrative services for our Retail Products and Services. See “Net Revenues – Investment Advisory and Services Fees” in Item 7 for information about our retail investment advisory and services fees. See Note 2 to AB’s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of the commissions we pay to financial intermediaries in connection with the sale of open-end AB Funds.
Fees paid by the U.S. Funds are reflected in the applicable investment management agreement, which generally must be approved annually by the boards of directors or trustees of those funds, including by a majority of the independent directors or trustees. Increases in these fees must be approved by fund shareholders; decreases need not be, including any decreases implemented by a fund’s directors or trustees. In general, each investment management agreement with the U.S. Funds provides for termination by either party at any time upon 60 days’ notice.
Fees paid by Non-U.S. Funds are reflected in management agreements that continue until they are terminated. Increases in these fees generally must be approved by the relevant regulatory authority, depending on the domicile and structure of the fund, and Non-U.S. Fund shareholders must be given advance notice of any fee increases.
The mutual funds we sub-advise for AXA, EQH and their respective subsidiaries together constitute our largest retail client. They accounted for approximately 19%, 19% and 21% of our retail AUM as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and approximately 4% of our retail net revenues in each of those years.
Certain subsidiaries of AXA and EQH, including AXA Advisors, LLC (“AXA Advisors”), were responsible for approximately 1%, 1% and 2% of total sales of shares of open-end AB Funds in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our affiliates are not under any obligation to sell a specific amount of AB Fund shares and also sell shares of mutual funds that they sponsor and that are sponsored by unaffiliated organizations. No entity accounted for 10% or more of our open-end AB Fund sales in 2018.
Most open-end U.S. Funds have adopted a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act that allows the fund to pay, out of assets of the fund, distribution and service fees for the distribution and sale of its shares (“Rule 12b-1 Fees”). The open-end U.S. Funds have entered into such agreements with us, and we have entered into selling and distribution agreements pursuant to which we pay sales commissions to the financial intermediaries that distribute our open-end U.S. Funds. These agreements are terminable by either party upon notice (generally 30 days) and do not obligate the financial intermediary to sell any specific amount of fund shares.
As of December 31, 2018, retail U.S. Fund AUM were approximately $43 billion, or 24% of retail AUM, as compared to $47 billion, or 25%, as of December 31, 2017, and $41 billion, or 26%, as of December 31, 2016. Non-U.S. Fund AUM, as of December 31, 2018, totaled $71 billion, or 39% of retail AUM, as compared to $76 billion, or 40%, as of December 31, 2017, and $59 billion, or 37%, as of December 31, 2016.
Our Retail Services represented approximately 35%, 35% and 33% of our AUM as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the fees we earned from providing these services represented approximately 44%, 43% and 42% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our AUM and revenues are as follows:

Bernstein Research Services
We offer high-quality fundamental research, quantitative services and brokerage-related services in equities and listed options to institutional investors, such as pension fund, hedge fund and mutual fund managers, and other institutional investors (“Bernstein Research Services”). We serve our clients, which are based in the United States and in other major markets around the world, through our trading professionals, who primarily are based in New York, London and Hong Kong, and our sell-side analysts, who provide fundamental company and industry research along with quantitative research into securities valuation and factors affecting stock-price movements.
We earn revenues for providing investment research to, and executing brokerage transactions for, institutional clients. These clients compensate us principally by directing us to execute brokerage transactions on their behalf, for which we earn commissions, and to a lesser, but increasing, extent by paying us directly for research through commission sharing agreements or cash payments. Bernstein Research Services accounted for approximately 13%, 14% and 16% of our net revenues as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
For information regarding trends in fee rates charged for brokerage transactions, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.
Our Bernstein Research Services revenues are as follows:

Custody
Our U.S.-based broker-dealer subsidiary acts as custodian for the majority of our Private Wealth Management AUM and some of our Institutions AUM. Other custodial arrangements are maintained by client-designated banks, trust companies, brokerage firms or custodians.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, our firm had 3,641 full-time employees, representing a 5.0% increase compared to the end of 2017.  
New York state law requires that private sector businesses with 50 or more full-time employees in the state give early warning of plant closings, layoffs, relocations and other covered reductions in work hours. This notification, known as the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (“WARN”) notice, must be provided to affected employees and their representatives, the New York State Department of Labor and the Local Workforce Investment Board, for relocations that affect 25 or more employees. In connection with the ongoing relocation of 1,050 roles from our White Plains and New York City locations to Nashville, Tennessee, we are required to file a series of WARN notices throughout the process, which began in the second half of 2018. We will continue to file these notices as these qualifying events occur, with the majority expected in 2019 and 2020.
Service Marks
We have registered a number of service marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign trademark offices, including the mark “AllianceBernstein.”  The logo set forth below and “Ahead of Tomorrow” are service marks of AB:

In January 2015, we established a new brand identity by prominently incorporating “AB” into our brand architecture, while maintaining the legal names of our corporate entities. With this and other related refinements, our company, and our Institutional and Retail businesses, now are referred to “AllianceBernstein (AB)” or simply “AB.” Private Wealth Management and Bernstein Research Services now are referred to as “AB Bernstein.”  Also, we adopted the logo and “Ahead of Tomorrow” service marks described above.
11

In connection with the Bernstein Transaction, we acquired all of the rights in, and title to, the Bernstein service marks, including the mark “Bernstein.”
In connection an acquisition we completed in 2013, we acquired all of the rights in, and title to, the W.P. Stewart & Co. service marks, including the logo “WPSTEWART.” 
Regulation
Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, rules of various securities regulators and exchanges, and laws in the foreign countries in which our subsidiaries conduct business. These laws and regulations primarily are intended to protect clients and fund shareholders and generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed on us include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in business for specific periods, the revocation of the registration as an investment adviser or broker-dealer, censures and fines.
AB, AB Holding, the General Partner and six of our subsidiaries (Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC (“SCB LLC”), AllianceBernstein Global Derivatives Corporation, AB Custom Alternative Solutions LLC, AB Private Credit Investors LLC, W.P. Stewart & Co., LLC and W.P. Stewart Asset Management LLC) are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. Additionally, AB Holding is an NYSE-listed company and, accordingly, is subject to applicable regulations promulgated by the NYSE. Also, AB, SCB LLC and AB Custom Alternative Solutions LLC are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers; SCB LLC also is registered with the CFTC as a commodities introducing broker.
Each U.S. Fund is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act and each Non-U.S. Fund is subject to the laws in the jurisdiction in which the fund is registered. For example, our platform of Luxembourg-based funds operates pursuant to Luxembourg laws and regulations, including Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives, and is authorized and supervised by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”), the primary regulator in Luxembourg. AllianceBernstein Investor Services, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, is registered with the SEC as a transfer and servicing agent.
SCB LLC and another of our subsidiaries, AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc., are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers, and both are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In addition, SCB LLC is a member of the NYSE and other principal U.S. exchanges.
Many of our subsidiaries are subject to the oversight of regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions outside the United States in which they operate, including the European Securities and Markets Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K., the CSSF in Luxembourg, the Financial Services Agency in Japan, the Securities & Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Financial Services Commission in South Korea and the Financial Supervisory Commission in Taiwan. While these regulatory requirements often may be comparable to the requirements of the SEC and other U.S. regulators, they are sometimes more restrictive and may cause us to incur substantial expenditures of time and money related to our compliance efforts. For additional information relating to the regulations that impact our business, please refer to "Risk Factors" in Item 1A.
Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act
AB, AB Holding and their global subsidiaries had no transactions or activities requiring disclosure under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, nor were they involved in the AXA Group matters described immediately below.
The non-U.S. based subsidiaries of AXA operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which they operate, including applicable international (United Nations and European Union) laws and regulations. While AXA Group companies based and operating outside the United States generally are not subject to U.S. law, as an international group, AXA has in place policies and standards (including the AXA Group International Sanctions Policy) that apply to all AXA Group companies worldwide and often impose requirements that go well beyond local law. For additional information regarding AXA, see "Principal Security Holders" in Item 12.
AXA has informed us that AXA Konzern AG, an AXA insurance subsidiary organized under the laws of Germany, provides car, accident and health insurance to diplomats based at the Iranian Embassy in Berlin, Germany. The total annual premium of these policies is approximately $139,700 and the annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $24,272.
12

AXA also has informed us that AXA Belgium, an AXA insurance subsidiary organized under the laws of Belgium, has two policies providing for car insurance for Global Trading NV, which was designated on May 17, 2018 under (E.O.) 13224 and subsequently changed its name to Energy Engineers & Construction on August 20, 2018. The total annual premium of these policies is approximately $6,559 before tax and the annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $983.
In addition, AXA has informed us that AXA Insurance Ireland, an AXA insurance subsidiary, provides statutorily required car insurance under four separate policies to the Iranian Embassy in Dublin, Ireland. AXA has informed us that compliance with the Declined Cases Agreement of the Irish Government prohibits the cancellation of these policies unless another insurer is willing to assume the coverage. The total annual premium for these policies is approximately $7,115 and the annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $853.
Also, AXA has informed us that AXA Sigorta, a subsidiary of AXA organized under the laws of the Republic of Turkey, provides car insurance coverage for vehicle pools of the Iranian General Consulate and the Iranian Embassy in Istanbul, Turkey. Motor liability insurance coverage is compulsory in Turkey and cannot be canceled unilaterally. The total annual premium in respect of these policies is approximately $3,150 and the annual net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $473.
Additionally, AXA has informed us that AXA Winterthur, an AXA insurance subsidiary organized under the laws of Switzerland, provides Naftiran Intertrade, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Iranian state-owned National Iranian Oil Company, with life, disability and accident coverage for its employees. In addition, AXA Winterthur also provides car and property insurance coverage for the Iranian Embassy in Bern. The provision of these forms of coverage is mandatory in Switzerland. The total annual premium of these policies is approximately $396,597 and the annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $59,489.
Also, AXA has informed us that AXA Egypt, an AXA insurance subsidiary organized under the laws of Egypt, provides the Iranian state-owned Iran Development Bank, two life insurance contracts, covering individuals who have loans with the bank. The total annual premium of these policies is approximately $19,839 and annual net profit arising from these policies, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $2,000.
Furthermore, AXA has informed us that AXA XL, which AXA acquired during the third quarter of 2018, through various non-U.S. subsidiaries, provides insurance to marine policyholders located outside of the U.S. or reinsurance coverage to non-U.S. insurers of marine risks as well as mutual associations of ship owners that provide their members with protection and liability coverage. The provision of these coverages may involve entities or activities related to Iran, including transporting crude oil, petrochemicals and refined petroleum products. AXA XL’s non-U.S. subsidiaries insure or reinsure multiple voyages and fleets containing multiple ships, so they are unable to attribute gross revenues and net profits from such marine policies to activities with Iran. As the activities of these insureds and re-insureds are permitted under applicable laws and regulations, AXA XL intends for its non-U.S. subsidiaries to continue providing such coverage to its insureds and re-insureds to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Lastly, a non-U.S. subsidiary of AXA XL provided accident & health insurance coverage to the diplomatic personnel of the Embassy of Iran in Brussels, Belgium during the third quarter of 2018. AXA XL’s non-U.S. subsidiary received aggregate payments for this insurance from inception through December 31, 2018 of approximately $73,451. Benefits of approximately $2,994 were paid to beneficiaries during 2018. These activities are permitted pursuant to applicable law. The policy has been canceled and is no longer in force.
The aggregate annual premium for the above-referenced insurance policies is approximately $646,411, representing approximately 0.0007% of AXA’s 2018 consolidated revenues, which we expect will exceed $100 billion. The related net profit, which is difficult to calculate with precision, is estimated to be $88,070, representing approximately 0.002% of AXA’s expected 2018 aggregate net profit.
History and Structure
We have been in the investment research and management business for more than 50 years. Bernstein was founded in 1967; Alliance Capital was founded in 1971 when the investment management department of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc. (since November 2000, a part of Credit Suisse Group) merged with the investment advisory business of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.
In April 1988, AB Holding “went public” as a master limited partnership. AB Holding Units, which trade under the ticker symbol “AB,” have been listed on the NYSE since that time.
13

In October 1999, AB Holding reorganized by transferring its business and assets to AB, a newly-formed operating partnership, in exchange for all of the AB Units (“Reorganization”). Since the date of the Reorganization, AB has conducted the business formerly conducted by AB Holding and AB Holding’s activities have consisted of owning AB Units and engaging in related activities. Unlike AB Holding Units, AB Units do not trade publicly and are subject to significant restrictions on transfer. The General Partner is the general partner of both AB and AB Holding.
In October 2000, our two legacy firms, Alliance Capital and Bernstein, combined, bringing together Alliance Capital’s expertise in growth equity and corporate fixed income investing and its family of retail mutual funds, with Bernstein’s expertise in value equity investing, tax-exempt fixed income management, and its Private Wealth Management and Bernstein Research Services businesses. 
As of December 31, 2018, the condensed ownership structure of AB is as follows (for a more complete description of our ownership structure, see “Principal Security Holders” in Item 12):
The General Partner owns 100,000 general partnership units in AB Holding and a 1% general partnership interest in AB. Including these general partnership interests, EQH, directly and through certain of its subsidiaries (see “Principal Security Holders” in Item 12), had an approximate 65.2% economic interest in AB as of December 31, 2018.
Competition
We compete in all aspects of our business with numerous investment management firms, mutual fund sponsors, brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations, and other financial institutions that often provide investment products that have similar features and objectives as those we offer. Our competitors offer a wide range of financial services to the same customers that we seek to serve. Some of our competitors are larger, have a broader range of product choices and investment capabilities, conduct business in more markets, and have substantially greater resources than we do. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current client relationships, and create new ones, will be successful.
In addition, AXA, EQH and their respective subsidiaries provide financial services, some of which compete with those we offer. The AB Partnership Agreement specifically allows AXA and its subsidiaries (other than the General Partner) to compete with AB and to pursue opportunities that may be available to us. AXA, EQH and certain of their respective subsidiaries have substantially greater financial resources than we do and are not obligated to provide resources to us.
14

To grow our business, we believe we must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include:

• | our investment performance for clients; 
• | our commitment to place the interests of our clients first; 
• | the quality of our research; 
• | our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled, and often highly specialized, personnel; 
• | the array of investment products we offer; 
• | the fees we charge; 
• | Morningstar/Lipper rankings for the AB Funds; 
• | our ability to sell our actively-managed investment services despite the fact that many investors favor passive services;
• | our operational effectiveness;
