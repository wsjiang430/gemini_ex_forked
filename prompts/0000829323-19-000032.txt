ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Company Overview
Inuvo is a technology company that provides data-driven platforms that can automatically identify and message online audiences for any product or service across devices, channels and formats, including video, mobile, connected TV, display, social and native. These capabilities allow Inuvo’s clients to engage with their customers and prospects in a manner that drives engagement from the first contact with the consumer. Inuvo facilitates over a billion marketing messages to consumers every single month and counts among its clients numerous world-renowned names in industries that have included retail, automotive, insurance, health care, technology, telecommunications and finance. Inuvo counts among its many contractual relationships, three clients who collectively manage over 50% of all U.S. digital media budgets.

Inuvo’s solution incorporates a proprietary form of artificial intelligence, or AI, branded the IntentKey. This sophisticated machine learning technology uses interactions with Internet content as a source of information from which to predict consumer intent. The AI includes a continually updated database of over 500 million machine profiles which Inuvo utilizes to deliver highly aligned online audiences to its clients. Inuvo earns revenue when consumers view or click on its client’s messages. Inuvo’s business scales through account management activity with existing clients and by adding new clients through sales activity.

As part of Inuvo’s technology strategy, it owns a collection of websites including alot.com and earnspendlive.com, where Inuvo creates content in health, finance, travel, careers, auto, education and living categories. These sites provide the means to test Inuvo’s technologies, while also delivering high quality consumers to clients through the interaction with proprietary content in the form of images, videos, slideshows and articles.

There are many barriers to entry to Inuvo’s business that would require proficiency in large scale data center management, software development, data products, analytics, artificial intelligence, integration to the internet of things, or IOT, the relationships required to execute within the IOT and the ability to process tens of billions of transactions daily. Inuvo’s intellectual property is protected by 15 issued and 8 pending patents.

Recent Developments
On November 2, 2018, Inuvo entered into the Merger Agreement with ConversionPoint Technologies ("CPT"), ConversionPoint Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CPT (“Parent”), CPT Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“CPT Merger Sub”), and CPT Cigar Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Inuvo Merger Sub”). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Inuvo will merge with and into Inuvo Merger Sub with Inuvo as the surviving corporation in the Inuvo Merger (the “Inuvo Merger”), and CPT merging with and into CPT Merger Sub with CPT as the surviving corporation in the CPT Merger (the “CPT Merger” and collectively with the Inuvo Merger, the “Merger”). Upon consummation of the Merger, CPT and Inuvo will be wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent. 
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger our stockholders will be entitled to receive $0.45 in cash and 0.18877 shares of Parent common stock for each share of common stock of Inuvo, and CPT’s stockholders will be entitled to receive 0.9840 shares of Parent common stock for each share of common stock of CPT. Each outstanding option to acquire a share of our common stock will be converted into an option to acquire 0.2370 shares of Parent’s common stock. In addition, unvested restricted stock units will vest in full immediately prior to consummation of the Merger and will be entitled to receive the merger consideration. No fractional shares of Parent common stock will be issued in the Merger and Parent stockholders and CPT stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional interests.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from each party to the agreement, and each party has agreed to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to (1) the conduct of the CPT’s and Inuvo’s businesses during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, (2) our obligations to facilitate our stockholders’ consideration of, and voting upon, the Merger Agreement and the Inuvo Merger, (3) CPT’s obligations to facilitate its stockholders’ consideration of, and voting upon, the Merger Agreement and the CPT Merger, (4) the recommendation by our Board of Directors in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement and the Inuvo Merger by our stockholders, and (5) Inuvo’s non-solicitation obligations relating to alternative business combination transactions.

The completion of the Merger is subject to (1) the approval of CPT’s stockholders and Inuvo’s stockholders, (2) regulatory approvals, (3) the closing of financing to the Parent of $36,000,000 (the “Financing”), (4) the approval of the listing of shares of Parent’s common stock on NASDAQ and conditional approval for listing on the TSX, (5) the delivery of customary opinions from counsel to the CPT and Inuvo to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free exchange for federal income tax purposes (6) Parent entering into separation agreements with Mr. Howe, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ruiz, our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, and Mr. Pisaris, our General Counsel, and (7) other customary closing conditions. Immediately following the Merger, Mr. Howe will serve as non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors of the Parent and an additional individual appointed by Inuvo shall serve on the seven member board of directors of the Parent.
The Merger Agreement contains customary termination rights for both Inuvo and CPT and further provides that (1) a termination payment of approximately $2.8 million will be payable by us to CPT in certain circumstances; and (2) a termination payment of approximately $2.8 million will be payable by CPT to Inuvo in certain circumstances, including if the Parent fails to consummate the Financing by May 31, 2019.
In addition, on November 1, 2018, Inuvo and ConversionPoint Investments, LLC., an affiliate of CPT (the "Noteholder") entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for up to $2 million pursuant to which Inuvo issued and sold a $1,000,000 principal amount 10% senior unsecured subordinated convertible promissory note ("the Subordinated Promissory Note") to the Noteholder which we are using for working capital. The terms of the Subordinated Promissory Note are described in Note 8 to the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report. 
On March 1, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated November 2, 2018 (the “Amendment”) to (i) due to the delays in the SEC’s ability to review and declare effective securities filings because of the government shutdown, extend the outside date for New Parent to receive funding in a financing from May 31, 2019 to July 12, 2019, and extend the outside termination date for closing of the Mergers from June 30, 2019, to August 5, 2019, (ii) permit the issuances of the above described Notes and permit us to issue up to 3,272,728 shares of common stock or securities convertible into up to 3,272,728 shares of our common stock, and waive any breach of our representations, warranties, or covenants that would be caused by the stock issuance. Our exchange ratio of 0.18877 shares of New Parent common stock for each share of our common stock for the stock portion of the merger consideration is adjusted downward to account for the dilutive effect of the stock issuance, and (iii) permit us to amend our articles of incorporation to increase the amount of its authorized shares of common stock from 40,000,000 to 60,000,000. 
On December 17, 2018 the Parent filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC for, among other matters, the stockholder meetings to be held by each of Inuvo and CPT. Unfortunately, as a result of the recent shutdown of the U.S. government between December 22, 2018 and January 25, 2019, the processing of this registration statement by the SEC was delayed. While all parties continue to diligently pursue its effectiveness and all actions necessary to proceed to a closing of the Merger, at this time we are unable to predict when such a closing may occur. The information which appears in this report gives no effect to the possible closing of the Merger.
Products and Services
The Inuvo digital marketplace allows advertisers and publishers the opportunity to buy and sell advertising space in real time and includes the following products and services:

• | ValidClick: A software as a service and delivery platform for publishers that offers a pay-per-click solution where advertisements are targeted to consumers based on content and behaviors.

Key Relationships
We maintain long-standing relationships with Yahoo!, Google and Microsoft Online that provide access to hundreds of thousands of advertisers from which most of our ValidClick and Digital Publishing revenue originates. When an advertisement is clicked, we effectively sell that click to these partners who then sell it to the advertisers. We maintain multi-year service

contracts with these companies. We also have contracts with OpenX and AppNexus that provide access to advertisers and publishers for the IntentKey. In 2018, these customers accounted for 92.9% of our total revenue as compared to 92.6% in 2017. 
In addition to our key customer relationships, we maintain important distribution relationships with owners and publishers of websites and mobile applications. We provide these partners with advertisements which they use to monetize their websites and mobile applications. We continuously monitor our partners' traffic with a variety of proprietary and patent protected software tools that can determine the quality of the traffic that is viewing and clicking on served advertisements.
Strategy
Our business strategy has been to develop technologies that displace intermediaries while cultivating relationships that provide access to media spend and media inventory. In this regard, we have proprietary demand and supply side technologies, consumer targeting technologies, on-page or in-app ad-unit technologies, proprietary data and data management technologies, and advertising fraud detection technologies. We have both direct and indirect relationships at some of the largest media buyers and/or consolidators in the industry. For our core business, the immediate strategy is to complement our indirect channels with more direct advertiser and publisher relationships as a way to reduce concentration risk and improve margins. 
Our ability to compete requires that our technology delivers strong monetization of publisher content. To accelerate the time to market for these technologies and so as to gain competitive reconnaissance, we have developed a set of owned and operated digital properties. These websites provide the means to test advertising technology in a controlled environment which in turn reduces the time to market for the introduction of those technologies. The strategy has the added benefit of providing a high quality directly controlled source of advertising inventory which can be adapted to meet demand and supply changes in near real time.
Our industry is currently in a consolidation phase. Our business strategy aligns with this trend as it is by design an end-to-end complete approach to the value chain. We evaluate acquisition candidates as opportunities arise that have either advertisers or advertising relationships we do not possess or publishers or publishing partners with whom we do not currently have a relationship.
Our device strategy is to become screen agnostic. We will continue to develop technologies that allow us to distribute ads across any medium.
Sales and Marketing
We drive general awareness of our brands through various marketing channels including our websites, social media, blogs, public relations, trade shows and conferences. Sales and marketing for our products differs based on whether they are demand or supply facing.
The demand side of our business includes sales executives who create demand from agencies, trading desks and brands directly. Leveraging our IntentKey technology to highlight our differentiation, our sales executives explain how we identify the most relevant content and audiences, allowing us to target these consumers when they are most prone to engage / respond / subscribe / tune-in and watch. Our product organization fulfills the business development initiatives that cement profitable relationships with programmatic demand partners, who are incorporated into our stack to drive monetization for our publishing partners.
The supply side of our business includes sales executives who sell to publishers directly. Creating differentiation, they explain our unique ability to create incremental revenue streams for publishers through our custom placements and unique approach to maximizing yield while preserving user experience.
Both demand and supply relationships require account management/campaign management, plus operations teams, who ensure that publisher implementations are successful, advertising campaigns deliver anticipated results and clients’ expectations are exceeded.
Competition
We face significant competition in our industry. Competitors continue to increase their suite of offerings across marketing channels to better compete for total advertising dollars.

A significant number of competitors have greater name recognition and are better capitalized than we are. Our ability to remain competitive in our market segment depends upon our ability to be innovative and to efficiently provide unique solutions to our demand and supply customers. There are no assurances we will be able to remain competitive in our markets in the future.
Technology Platforms
Our proprietary applications are constructed from established, readily available technologies. Some of the basic elements of our products are built on components from leading software and hardware providers such as Oracle, Microsoft, Sun, Dell, EMC, and Cisco, while some components are constructed from leading open source software projects such as Apache Web Server, MySQL, Java, Perl, Java and Linux. By seeking to strike the proper balance between using commercially available software and open source software, our technology expenditures are directed toward maintaining our technology platforms while minimizing third-party technology supplier costs.

We strive to build high-performance, availability and reliability into our product offerings. We safeguard against the potential for service interruptions at our third-party technology vendors by engineering controls into our critical components. We deliver our hosted solutions from facilities, geographically disbursed throughout the United States and maintain ready, on-demand services through third-party cloud providers Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services to enhance our business continuity. Our applications are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by specialized monitoring systems that aggregate alarms to a human-staffed network operations center. If a problem occurs, appropriate engineers are notified, and corrective action is taken.
Intellectual Property Rights
We own intellectual property (IP) and related IP rights that relate to our products, services and assets. Our IP portfolio includes patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We actively seek to protect our IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets.  While our IP rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent on any single patent, trademark, or other IP right. 
Our trademarks include the U.S. Federal Registration for our consumer facing brand ALOT® in the United States.  Our patents include fifteen patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) and eight pending patent applications.
To distinguish our products and services from our competitors’ products, we have obtained trademarks and trade names for our products. We also protect details about our processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Employees
As of February 28, 2019, we had 60 full-time employees, none of which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Seasonality
Our future results of operations may be subject to fluctuation because of seasonality. Historically, in the later part of the fourth quarter and the earlier part of the first quarter we experience lower revenue due to a decline in demand for inventory on websites and apps and the recalibrating of advertiser’s marketing budgets after the holiday selling season. If we are not able to appropriately adjust to seasonal or other factors, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
History
We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada in October 1987 and operated within the oil and gas industry. This endeavor was not profitable, and from 1993 to 1997 we had essentially no operations. In 1997 we reorganized and through 2006 we acquired a number of companies involved in advertising and internet marketing. In 2009, following the weakness in the economy, a new team was called in to assess the array of businesses that had been acquired in the preceding years and as a result between 2009 and 2011, we sold or retired eleven businesses.
In March 2012, as part of a long-term strategy, we acquired Vertro, Inc. ("Vertro"), which owns and operates the ALOT product portfolio. This acquisition included the ALOT brand, as well as a long-standing relationship with Google. In 2013, with a grant funded by the State of Arkansas, we moved the headquarters to Arkansas where we have remained.

In February 2017, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with NetSeer, Inc. ("NetSeer") which allowed us to advance our technology strategy while increasing both our number of advertisers and publishers. We exchanged 3,529,000 shares of Inuvo common stock and assumed approximately $6.8 million of specified liabilities in this business combination (See Note 17).
