For additional information, see “Item 2. Properties.”
Hoquiam, with a population of approximately 8,600, is located in Grays Harbor County which is situated along Washington State’s central Pacific coast.  Hoquiam is located approximately 110 miles southwest of Seattle, Washington and 145 miles northwest of Portland, Oregon.

The Bank considers its primary market area to include six sub-markets: primarily rural Grays Harbor County with its historical dependence on the timber and fishing industries; Thurston and Kitsap counties with their dependence on state and federal government; Pierce and King counties with their broadly diversified economic bases; and Lewis County with its dependence on retail trade, manufacturing, industrial services and local government.  Each of these markets presents operating risks to the Bank.  The Bank’s expansion into Pierce, Thurston, Kitsap, King and Lewis counties represents the Bank’s strategy to expand and diversify its primary market area to become less reliant on the economy of Grays Harbor County.
Grays Harbor County has a population of 74,000 according to the United States ("U.S.") Census Bureau 2018 estimates and a median family income of $63,500 according to 2019 estimates from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).

Lending Activities
General.  Historically, the principal lending activity of the Bank has consisted of the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences, or by commercial real estate and loans for the construction of one- to four-family residences.  The Bank’s net loans receivable totaled $886.66 million at September 30, 2019, representing 71.1% of consolidated total assets, and at that date commercial real estate, construction (including undisbursed loans in process), multi-family and land loans were $749.45 million, or 75.6% of total loans.  Commercial real estate, construction, multi-family, and land loans typically have higher rates of return than one- to four-family loans; however, they also present a higher degree of risk.  
The Bank’s internal loan policy limits the maximum amount of loans to one borrower to 20% of its capital plus surplus. According to the Washington Administrative Code, capital and surplus are defined as a bank's Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital and the balance of a bank's allowance for loan losses not included in the bank's Tier 2 capital as reported in the bank's call report. At September 30, 2019, the maximum amount which the Bank could have lent to any one borrower and the borrower’s related entities was approximately $32.48 million under this policy.  At September 30, 2019, the largest amount outstanding to any one borrower and the borrower’s related entities was $18.30 million, which was secured by multi-family and commercial real estate properties located in King and Benton counties and were performing according to their loan repayment terms at September 30, 2019.  The next largest amount outstanding to any one borrower and the borrower’s related entities was $16.40 million.  These loans were secured by commercial real estate properties and other business assets located in King County and were performing according to their loan repayment terms at September 30, 2019.

Residential One- to Four-Family Lending.  At September 30, 2019, $132.66 million, or 13.4%, of the Bank’s loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by one- to four-family residences.  The Bank originates both fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans.
Generally, one- to four-family fixed-rate loans are originated to meet the requirements for sale in the secondary market to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") or the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB").  From time to time, however, a portion of these fixed-rate loans may be retained in the loan portfolio to meet the Bank’s asset/liability management objectives. The Bank uses an automated underwriting program, which preliminarily qualifies a loan as conforming to Freddie Mac underwriting standards when the loan is originated.  At September 30, 2019, $37.95 million, or 28.6%, of the Bank’s one- to four-family loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate mortgage loans.
The Bank also offers adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans.  All of the Bank’s ARM loans are retained in its loan portfolio.  The Bank offers several ARM products which adjust annually or every three to five years after an initial period ranging from one to five years and are typically subject to a limitation on the annual interest rate increase of 2% and an overall limitation of 6%.  These ARM products generally are re-priced utilizing the weekly average yield on one year U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year plus a margin of 2.75% to 4.00%.  The Bank also offers ARM loans tied to The Wall Street Journal prime lending rate ("Prime Rate") index which typically do not have periodic or lifetime adjustment limits.  Loans tied to the Prime Rate normally have margins ranging up to 3.0%.  ARM loans held in the Bank’s portfolio do not permit negative amortization of principal.  Borrower demand for ARM loans versus fixed-rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan.  The relative amount of fixed-rate mortgage loans and ARM loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment.  At September 30, 2019, $94.71 million, or 71.4%, of the Bank’s one- to four- family loan portfolio consisted of ARM loans.
A portion of the Bank’s ARM loans are “non-conforming”, because they do not satisfy acreage limits or various other requirements imposed by Freddie Mac.  Some of these loans are also originated to meet the needs of borrowers who cannot otherwise satisfy Freddie Mac credit requirements because of personal and financial reasons (i.e., divorce, bankruptcy, length of time employed, etc.), and other aspects, which do not conform to Freddie Mac’s guidelines.  Such borrowers may have higher debt-to-income ratios, or the loans are secured by unique properties in rural markets for which there are no sales of comparable properties to support the value according to secondary market requirements.  These loans are known as non-conforming loans, and the Bank may require additional collateral or lower loan-to-value ratios to reduce the risk of these loans.  The Bank believes that these loans satisfy a need in its local market area.  As a result, subject to market conditions, the Bank intends to continue to originate these types of loans.
The retention of ARM loans in the Bank’s loan portfolio helps reduce the Bank’s exposure to changes in interest rates.  There are, however, unquantifiable credit risks resulting from the potential of increased interest to be paid by the customer as a result of increases in interest rates.  It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates the risk of default on ARM loans may increase as a result of repricing and the increased costs to the borrower.  The Bank attempts to reduce the potential for delinquencies and defaults on ARM loans by qualifying the borrower based on the borrower’s ability to repay the ARM loan assuming a 2.0% increase in the initial interest rate.  Another consideration is that although ARM loans allow the Bank to increase the sensitivity of its asset base due to changes in the interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.  Because of these considerations, the Bank has no assurance that yield increases on ARM loans will be sufficient to offset increases in the Bank’s cost of funds.
While fixed-rate, single-family residential mortgage loans are normally originated with 15 to 30 year terms to maturity, these loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan.  In addition, substantially all mortgage loans in the Bank’s loan portfolio contain due-on-sale clauses providing that the Bank may declare the unpaid amount due and payable upon the sale of the property securing the loan.  Typically, the Bank enforces these due-on-sale clauses to the extent permitted by law and as business judgment dictates.  Thus, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates received on outstanding loans.
The Bank requires that fire and extended coverage casualty insurance be maintained on the collateral for all of its real estate secured loans and flood insurance, if appropriate.
The Bank’s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio on mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied properties to 95% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price.  However, the Bank usually obtains private mortgage insurance (“PMI”) on the portion of the principal amount that exceeds 80% of the appraised value of the security property. The maximum loan-to-value ratio on mortgage loans secured by non-owner-occupied properties is generally 80% (90% for loans

originated for sale in the secondary market to Freddie Mac or the FHLB).  At September 30, 2019, three one- to four-family loans totaling $699,000 were on non-accrual status.  See “Lending Activities - Non-performing Loans and Delinquencies.”
Multi-Family Lending.  At September 30, 2019, $76.04 million, or 7.7%, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio was secured by multi-family dwelling units (more than four units) located primarily in the Bank’s primary market area.  Multi-family loans are generally originated with variable rates of interest ranging from 1.00% to 3.50% over the one-year constant maturity U.S. Treasury Bill Index, the Prime Rate or a matched term FHLB borrowing, with principal and interest payments fully amortizing over terms of up to 30 years.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank’s largest multi-family loan had an outstanding principal balance of $5.29 million and was secured by an apartment building located in Clark County. At September 30, 2019, this loan was performing according to its repayment terms.  
The maximum loan-to-value ratio for multi-family loans is generally limited to not more than 80%.  The Bank generally requests its multi-family loan borrowers with loan balances in excess of $750,000 to submit financial statements and rent rolls annually on the properties securing such loans.  The Bank also inspects such properties annually.  The Bank generally imposes a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.20 for loans secured by multi-family properties.
Multi-family mortgage lending affords the Bank an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those generally available from one- to four- family residential lending.  However, loans secured by multi-family properties usually are greater in amount, more difficult to evaluate and monitor and, therefore, may involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.  Because payments on loans secured by multi-family properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  The Bank seeks to minimize these risks by scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower, the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan.  If the borrower is other than an individual, the Bank also generally obtains personal guarantees from the principals (with ownership interests of 20% or more) based on a review of personal financial statements. At September 30, 2019, all multi-family loans were performing according to their repayment terms. See "Lending Activities - Non-performing Loans and Delinquencies."
Commercial Real Estate Lending.  Commercial real estate loans totaled $419.12 million, or 42.3%, of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2019.  The Bank originates commercial real estate loans generally at variable interest rates with principal and interest payments fully amortizing over terms of up to 30 years.  These loans are secured by properties, such as office buildings, retail/wholesale facilities, mini-storage facilities, motels, nursing homes, restaurants and convenience stores, generally located in the Bank’s primary market area.  At September 30, 2019, the largest commercial real estate loan was secured by a medical building in Pierce County, had a balance of $7.93 million and was performing according to its repayment terms.  At September 30, 2019, two commercial real estate loans totaling $779,000  were on non-accrual status.  See “Lending Activities - Non-performing Loans and Delinquencies.”
The Bank typically requires appraisals of properties securing commercial real estate loans.  For loans that are less than $250,000, the Bank may use an evaluation provided by a third party vendor in lieu of an appraisal.  Appraisals are performed by independent appraisers designated by the Bank.  The Bank considers the quality and location of the real estate, the credit history of the borrower, the cash flow of the project and the quality of management involved with the property when making these loans.  The Bank generally imposes a minimum debt coverage ratio of approximately 1.20 for loans secured by income producing commercial properties.  Loan-to-value ratios on commercial real estate loans are generally limited to not more than 80%.  If the borrower is other than an individual, the Bank also generally obtains personal guarantees from the principals (with ownership interests of 20% or more) based on a review of personal financial statements.
Commercial real estate lending affords the Bank an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those generally available from one- to four-family residential lending.  However, loans secured by such properties usually are greater in amount, more difficult to evaluate and monitor and, therefore, involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.  Because payments on loans secured by commercial properties often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy.  The Bank seeks to minimize these risks by generally limiting the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 80% and scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower, the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan.  The Bank also generally requests annual financial information and rent rolls on the subject property from the borrowers on loans over $750,000.
Construction Lending.      The Bank currently originates two types of residential construction loans:  (i) custom construction and owner/builder construction loans and (ii) speculative construction loans.  The Bank believes that its lengthy experience in providing residential construction loans has enabled it to establish processing and disbursement procedures to meet the needs of its borrowers while reducing many of the risks inherent with construction lending.  The Bank also originates construction loans for multi-family properties, commercial properties, and land development projects.  The Bank's construction

loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is billed monthly, although during the term of some construction loans no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. At September 30, 2019, the Bank's construction loans totaled $223.53 million, or 22.5% of the Bank's total loan portfolio, including undisbursed loans in process of $92.23 million. All construction loans were performing according to their repayment terms at September 30, 2019. See "Lending Activities - Non-performing Loans and Delinquencies."
At September 30, 2019 and 2018, the composition of the Bank’s construction loan portfolio was as follows:

Custom and owner/builder construction loans are originated to home owners and are typically converted to or refinanced into permanent loans at the completion of construction.  The construction phase of these loans generally lasts up to 12 months with fixed interest rates typically ranging from 4.50% to 6.50% and with loan-to-value ratios of 80% (or up to 95% with PMI) of the appraised estimated value of the completed property.  At the completion of construction, the loan is converted to or refinanced into either a fixed-rate mortgage loan, which conforms to secondary market standards, or an ARM loan for retention in the Bank’s portfolio.  At September 30, 2019, custom and owner/builder construction loans totaled $128.85 million, or 57.6% of the total construction loan portfolio.  At September 30, 2019, the largest outstanding custom and owner/builder construction loan had an outstanding balance of $1.76 million (including $788,000 of undisbursed loans in process) and was performing according to its repayment terms. 
Speculative one- to four-family construction loans are made to home builders and are termed “speculative” because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either the Bank or another lender for the finished home.  The home buyer may be identified either during or after the construction period, with the risk that the builder will have to debt service the speculative construction loan and pay real estate taxes and other carrying costs of the completed home for a significant time after the completion of construction until the home buyer is identified and a sale is consummated.  Rather than originating lines of credit to home builders to construct several homes at once, the Bank generally originates and underwrites a separate loan for each home.  Speculative construction loans are generally originated for a term of 12 months, with current rates generally ranging from 5.00% to 7.00%, and with a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 80% of the appraised value of the completed property.  At September 30, 2019, speculative one- to four-family construction loans totaled $16.45 million, or 7.4% of the total construction loan portfolio.  At September 30, 2019, the largest aggregate outstanding balance to one borrower for speculative one- to four-family construction loans totaled $2.60 million (including $1.48 million of undisbursed loans in process) and was comprised of eleven loans that were performing according to their repayment terms.  
The Bank also provides construction financing for multi-family and commercial properties.  At September 30, 2019, these loans amounted to $75.83 million, or 33.9%, of construction loan balances compared to $50.33 million, or 26.7%, of construction loan balances at September 30, 2018.  These loans are typically secured by apartment buildings, condominiums, mini-storage facilities, office buildings, hotels and retail rental space predominantly located in the Bank’s primary market area.  At September 30, 2019, the largest outstanding multi-family construction loan was secured by an apartment building project in Thurston County and had a balance of $11.0 million (including $10.8 million of undisbursed construction loan proceeds) and was performing according to its repayment terms.  At September 30, 2019, the largest outstanding commercial real estate construction loan was secured by an assisted living facility project in King County and had a balance of $6.10 million. This loan was performing according to its repayment terms at September 30, 2019. 
All construction loans must be approved by a member of one of the Bank’s Loan Committees or the Bank’s Board of Directors, or in the case of one- to four-family construction loans that meet Freddie Mac guidelines, by the Regional Manager of Community Lending, the Loan Department Supervisor or a Bank underwriter. See “- Lending Activities - Loan Solicitation and 
10

Processing.”  Prior to approval of any construction loan application, an independent fee appraiser inspects the site and prepares an appraisal on an "as completed" basis and the Bank reviews the existing or proposed improvements, identifies the market for the proposed project and analyzes the pro-forma data and assumptions on the project.  In the case of a speculative or custom construction loan, the Bank reviews the experience and expertise of the builder.  After this preliminary review, the application is processed, which includes obtaining credit reports, financial statements and tax returns or verification of income on the borrowers and guarantors, an independent appraisal of the project, and any other expert reports necessary to evaluate the proposed project.  In the event of cost overruns, the Bank generally requires that the borrower increase the funds available for construction by paying the cost of such overruns directly or by depositing its own funds into a secured savings account, the proceeds of which are used to pay construction costs, or to the extent available authorizes disbursements from a loan contingency line in the construction budget.
Loan disbursements during the construction period are made to the builder, materials supplier or subcontractor, based on a line item budget.  Periodic on-site inspections are made by qualified independent inspectors to document the reasonableness of draw requests.  For most builders, the Bank disburses loan funds by providing vouchers to borrowers, which when used by the borrower to purchase supplies are submitted by the supplier to the Bank for payment.
The Bank originates construction loan applications primarily through customer referrals, contacts in the business community and occasionally real estate brokers seeking financing for their clients.
Construction lending affords the Bank the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than does its single-family permanent mortgage lending.  Construction lending, however, is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family permanent mortgage lending because funds are advanced upon the collateral for the project based on an estimate of the costs that will produce a future value at completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio.  With regard to loans originated to builders for speculative projects, changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs, may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. A downturn in the housing, or the real estate market, could increase loan delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures, and significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Some builders who have borrowed from us to fund construction projects on a speculative basis have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss.
In addition, during the term of many of our construction loans granted to builders who are building residential units for sale, no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. As a result, these loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers' borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction. Furthermore, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is an added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. 
The Bank historically originated loans to real estate developers with whom it had established relationships for the purpose of developing residential subdivisions (i.e., installing roads, sewers, water and other utilities; generally with ten to 50 lots). At September 30, 2019, land development loans totaled $2.40 million, or 1.1% of the total construction loan portfolio. Currently, the Bank is originating land development loans on a limited basis.  Land development loans are secured by a lien on the property and typically are made for a period of two to five years with fixed or variable interest rates, with loan-to-value ratios generally not exceeding 75%.  Land development loans are generally structured so that the Bank is repaid in full upon the sale by the borrower of approximately 80% of the subdivision lots.  In addition, in the case of a corporate borrower, the Bank also generally obtains personal guarantees from corporate principals (with ownership interests in the borrowing entity of 20% or more) and reviews their personal financial statements. Land development loans secured by land under development involve greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because these loan funds are advanced upon the predicted future value of the developed property upon completion.  If the estimate of the future value proves to be inaccurate, in the event of default and foreclosure the Bank may be confronted with a property the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment.  The Bank has historically attempted to 
11

minimize this risk by generally limiting the maximum loan-to-value ratio on land and land development loans to 75% of the estimated developed value of the secured property.  
Land Lending. The Bank originates loans for the acquisition of land upon which the purchaser can then build or make improvements necessary to build or to use for recreational purposes.  At September 30, 2019, land loans totaled $30.77 million, or 3.1%, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio.  Land loans originated by the Bank generally have maturities of one to ten years.  The largest land loan is secured by land in Thurston County, had an outstanding balance of $2.02 million and was performing according to its repayment terms at September 30, 2019.  At September 30, 2019, three land loans totaling $204,000 were on non-accrual status.  See “Lending Activities - Non-performing Loans and Delinquencies.”
Loans secured by undeveloped land or improved lots involve greater risks than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because these loans are more difficult to evaluate.  If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, in the event of default and foreclosure the Bank may be confronted with a property the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment. Land loans also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions.  The Bank attempts to minimize these risks by generally limiting the maximum loan-to-value ratio on land loans to 75%.
Consumer Lending.  Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity and may have higher interest rates than mortgage loans.  Consumer loans include home equity lines of credit, second mortgage loans, savings account loans, automobile loans, boat loans, motorcycle loans, recreational vehicle loans and unsecured loans.  Consumer loans are made with both fixed and variable interest rates and with varying terms.  At September 30, 2019, consumer loans amounted to $44.50 million, or 4.5%, of the Bank's total loan portfolio.
At September 30, 2019, the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio consisted of second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, which totaled $40.19 million, or 4.1%, of the Bank's total loan portfolio.  Home equity lines of credit and second mortgage loans are made for purposes such as the improvement of residential properties, debt consolidation and education expenses, among others.  The majority of these loans are made to existing customers and are secured by a first or second mortgage on residential property.  The loan-to-value ratio is typically 90% or less, when taking into account both the first and second mortgage loans.  Second mortgage loans typically carry fixed interest rates with a fixed payment over a term between five and 15 years.  Home equity lines of credit are generally made at interest rates tied to the Prime Rate.  Second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in which the Bank is in the first lien position because they are generally secured by mortgages subordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property. For those second mortgage loans and home equity lines credit which the Bank does not hold the existing first mortgage on the property, it is unlikely that the Bank will be successful in recovering all or a portion of the loan balance in the event of default unless the Bank is prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property.

Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles.  In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation.  The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment.  In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.  Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.  The Bank believes that these risks are not as prevalent in the case of the Bank’s consumer loan portfolio because a large percentage of the portfolio consists of second mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit that are underwritten in a manner such that they result in credit risk that is substantially similar to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.  At September 30, 2019, eight consumer loans totaling $626,000 were on non-accrual status. See “Lending Activities - Non-performing Loans and Delinquencies.”

Commercial Business Lending.  Commercial business loans totaled $64.76 million, or 6.5%, of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2019.  Commercial business loans are generally secured by business equipment, accounts receivable, inventory and/or other property and are made at variable rates of interest equal to a negotiated margin above the Prime Rate.  The Bank also generally obtains personal guarantees from the principals based on a review of personal financial statements. The largest commercial business loan had an outstanding balance of $1.85 million at September 30, 2019 and was performing according to its repayment terms.  At September 30, 2019, ten commercial business loans totaling $725,000 were on non-accrual status.  See “Lending Activities - Non-performing Loans and Delinquencies.”

The Bank has increased commercial business loan originations made under the U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") 7(a) program. Loans made by the Bank under the SBA 7(a) program generally are made to small businesses to provide working capital or to provide funding for the purchase of businesses, real estate, or equipment. These loans generally are secured by a combination of assets that may include equipment, receivables, inventory, business real property, and sometimes a lien on the personal residence of the borrower. The terms of these loans vary by purpose and type of underlying collateral. The loans are primarily underwritten on the basis of the borrower's ability to service the loan from income. Under the SBA 7(a) program the loans carry a SBA guaranty for up to 85% of the loan. Typical maturities for this type of loan vary but can be up to ten years. SBA 7(a) loans are all adjustable rate loans based on the Prime Rate. Under the SBA 7(a) program, the Bank can sell in the secondary market the guaranteed portion of its SBA 7(a) loans and retain the related unguaranteed portion of these loans, as well as the servicing on such loans, for which it is paid a fee. The loan servicing spread is generally a minimum of 1.00% on all SBA 7(a) loans. The Bank generally offers SBA 7(a) loans within a range of $50,000 to $1.50 million. 
Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending.  Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values, and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default.  Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and/or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things.  Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment.

Loan Maturity.  The following table sets forth certain information at September 30, 2019 regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in the Bank’s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity but does not include scheduled payments or potential prepayments.  Loans having no stated maturity and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less.

Scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of these assets.  The average life of loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments.  In addition, due-on-sale clauses on loans generally give the Bank the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid.  The average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan interest rates are substantially higher than interest rates on existing mortgage loans and, conversely, decrease when interest rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan interest rates.
Loan Solicitation and Processing.  Loan originations are obtained from a variety of sources, including walk-in customers and referrals from builders and realtors.  Upon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower, a credit report and other data are obtained to verify specific information relating to the loan applicant’s employment, income and credit standing.  An appraisal of the real estate offered as collateral generally is undertaken by a certified appraiser retained by the Bank.
Loan applications are initiated by loan officers and are required to be approved by an authorized loan officer or Bank underwriter, one of the Bank’s Loan Committees or the Bank’s Board of Directors.  The Bank’s Consumer Loan Committee consists of several underwriters, each of whom can approve one- to four-family mortgage loans and other consumer loans up to and including the current Freddie Mac single-family limit. Loan officers may also be granted individual approval authority for certain loans up to a maximum of $250,000. The approval authority for individual loan officers is granted on a case by case basis by the Bank's Chief Credit Administrator or President.  All construction loans must be approved by a member of one of the Bank's Loan Committees or the Bank's Board of Directors, or in the case of one- to four- family construction loans that meet Freddie Mac guidelines, by the Regional Manager of Community Lending, the Loan Department Supervisor or a Bank underwriter, subject to their individual or Loan Committee loan limit. The Bank’s Commercial Loan Committee, which consists of the Bank’s President, Chief Credit Administrator, Executive Vice President of Lending and two Senior Vice Presidents of Commercial Lending, may approve commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans up to and including $3.00 million. The Bank’s President, Chief Credit Administrator and Executive Vice President of Lending also have individual lending authority for loans up to and including $750,000. The Bank’s Board Loan Committee, which consists of two rotating non-employee Directors and the Bank’s President, may approve loans up to and including $5.00 million.  Loans in excess of $5.00 million, as well as loans of any amount granted to a single borrower whose aggregate loans exceed $5.00 million, must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. 
Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales.  During the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Bank’s total gross loan originations were $356.04 million, $329.59 million and $340.61 million, respectively.  Periodically, the Bank purchases loan participation interests in construction, commercial real estate and multi-family loans, secured by properties generally located in Washington State, from other banks.  These participation loans are underwritten in accordance with the Bank’s underwriting guidelines and are without recourse to the seller other than for fraud.  During the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Bank purchased loan participation interests of $8.66 million, $8.40 million and $13.10 million, respectively. 
Consistent with its asset/liability management strategy, the Bank’s policy generally is to retain in its portfolio all ARM loans originated and to sell fixed rate one- to four-family mortgage loans in the secondary market to Freddie Mac; however, from time to time, a portion of fixed-rate loans may be retained in the Bank’s portfolio to meet its asset-liability objectives. The Bank also began selling the guaranteed portion of some of its SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market during the year ended September 
14

30, 2016.  Loans sold in the secondary market are generally sold on a servicing retained basis.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank’s loan servicing portfolio, which is not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, totaled $399.12 million.
The Bank also periodically sells participation interests in construction loans, commercial real estate loans, multi-family and commercial business loans to other lenders.  These sales are usually made to avoid concentrations in a particular loan type or concentrations to a particular borrower and to generate fee income.  During the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Bank sold loan participation interests of $5.43 million, $253,000, and $9.28 million, respectively.

Loan Origination Fees.  The Bank receives loan origination fees on many of its mortgage loans and commercial business loans.  Loan fees are a percentage of the loan which are charged to the borrower for funding the loan.  The amount of fees charged by the Bank is generally up to 2.0% of the loan amount.  Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") require fees received and certain loan origination costs for originating loans to be deferred and amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan.  Net deferred fees or costs associated with loans that are prepaid are recognized as income/expense at the time of prepayment.  Unamortized net deferred loan origination fees totaled $2.80 million at September 30, 2019.

Non-performing Loans and Delinquencies.  The Bank assesses late fees or penalty charges on delinquent loans of approximately 5% of the monthly loan payment amount.  A majority of loan payments are due on the first day of the month; however, the borrower is given a 15 day grace period to make the loan payment.  When a mortgage loan borrower fails to make a required payment when due, the Bank institutes collection procedures. A notice is mailed to the borrower 16 days after the date the payment is due.  Attempts to contact the borrower by telephone generally begin on or before the 30th day of delinquency.  If a satisfactory response is not obtained, continuous follow-up contacts are attempted until the loan has been brought current.  Before the 90th day of delinquency, attempts are made to establish (i) the cause of the delinquency, (ii) whether the cause is temporary, (iii) the attitude of the borrower toward repaying the debt, and (iv) a mutually satisfactory arrangement for curing the default.
If the borrower is chronically delinquent and all reasonable means of obtaining payment on time have been exhausted, foreclosure is initiated according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law.  Interest income on loans in foreclosure is reduced by the full amount of accrued and uncollected interest.
When a consumer loan borrower or commercial business borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan by the payment due date, the Bank institutes similar collection procedures as for its mortgage loan borrowers.  All loans becoming 90 days or more past due are placed on non-accrual status, with any accrued interest reversed against interest income, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection.
The Bank’s Board of Directors is updated monthly as to the status of loans that are delinquent by more than 30 days and the status of all foreclosed and repossessed property owned by the Bank.

The Bank’s non-accrual loans increased by $1.71 million to $3.03 million at September 30, 2019 from $1.32 million at September 30, 2018, primarily as a result of a $779,000 increase in commercial real estate loans, a $555,000 increase in commercial business loans, a $267,000 increase in consumer loans, and a $154,000 increase in one- to four-family mortgage loans, on non-accrual status. These increases were partially offset by a $39,000 decrease in land loans on non-accrual status. A discussion of the Bank's largest non-performing loans is set forth below under “Asset Classification.”
Additional interest income which would have been recorded for the year ended September 30, 2019 had non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms totaled $362,000.
Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets.  Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned (“OREO”) until sold.  When property is acquired, it is recorded at the estimated fair market value less estimated costs to sell.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank had $1.68 million of OREO and other repossessed assets consisting of 12 individual properties, a decrease of $230,000 from $1.91 million at September 30, 2018.  The OREO properties consisted of 11 land parcels totaling $1.66 million, and one commercial real estate property with a book value of $25,000.  The largest OREO property at September 30, 2019 was an undeveloped land parcel with a balance of $874,000 located in Lewis County.
Restructured Loans.  Under GAAP, the Bank is required to account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as “troubled debt restructurings” or "troubled debt restructured loans."  A troubled debt restructured loan ("TDR") is a loan for which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. Examples of such concessions include but are not limited to: a reduction in the stated interest rate; an extension of the maturity at an interest rate below current market rates; a reduction in the face amount of the debt; a reduction in the accrued interest; or re-amortizations, extensions, deferrals and renewals. TDRs are considered impaired and are individually evaluated for impairment. TDRs are classified as either accrual or non-accrual. TDRs are classified as non-performing loans unless they have been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a period of at least six months. The Bank had TDRs at September 30, 2019 and 2018 totaling $3.27 million and $3.28 million, respectively, of which $366,000 and $323,000, respectively, were on non-accrual status. The allowance for loan losses allocated to TDR loans at September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $56,000 and $97,000, respectively. 
Impaired Loans. In accordance with GAAP, a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts (principal and interest) when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans, may be collectively evaluated for impairment. When a loan has been identified as being impaired, the amount of the impairment is measured by using discounted cash flows, except when, as an alternative, the current estimated fair value of the collateral, reduced by estimated costs to sell (if applicable), or observable market price is used. The valuation of real estate collateral is subjective in nature and may be adjusted in future periods because of changes in economic conditions. Management considers third-party appraisals, as well as independent fair market value assessments from realtors or persons involved in selling real estate, in determining the estimated fair value of particular properties. In addition, as certain of these third-party appraisals and independent fair market value assessments are only updated periodically, changes in the values of specific properties may have occurred subsequent to the most recent appraisals. Accordingly, the amounts of any such potential changes and any related adjustments are generally recorded at the time such information is received. When the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan (including accrued interest and net deferred loan origination fees or costs), impairment is recognized by creating or adjusting an allocation of the allowance for loan losses and uncollected accrued interest is reversed against interest income. If ultimate collection of principal is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired loans are applied to reduce the principal balance.
The categories of non-accrual loans and impaired loans overlap, although they are not identical.  The Bank considers all circumstances regarding the loan and borrower on an individual basis when determining whether an impaired loan should be 
17

placed on non-accrual status, such as the financial strength of the borrower, the collateral value, reasons for delay, payment record, the amount past due and the number of days past due.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank had $5.94 million in impaired loans.  For additional information on impaired loans, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Loans of Concern.  Loans not reflected in the table above as non-performing, but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans as non-performing assets in the future, are commonly referred to as “other loans of concern” or “potential problem loans.”  The amount included in potential problem loans results from an evaluation, on a loan-by-loan basis, of loans classified as “substandard” and “special mention,” as those terms are defined under “Asset Classification” below.  The amount of potential problem loans (not included in the table above as non-performing) was $4.83 million at September 30, 2019. The vast majority of these loans are collateralized by real estate.  See “Asset Classification” below for additional information regarding the Bank's problem loans.
Asset Classification.  Applicable regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis.  In addition, in connection with examinations of insured institutions, regulatory examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified.  There are three classifications for problem assets:  substandard, doubtful and loss.  Substandard loans are classified as those loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor, or of the collateral pledged.  Assets classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the repayment of the debt.  If the weakness or weaknesses are not corrected there is the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained.  Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss.  An asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the Bank is not warranted.  When the Bank classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it is required to establish allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.  These allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities and the risks associated with particular problem assets.  When the Bank classifies problem assets as loss, it charges off the balance of the asset against the allowance for loan losses.  Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated by the Bank as special mention.  Special mention loans are defined as those credits deemed by management to have some potential weakness that deserve management’s close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the payment prospects of the loan.  Assets in this category are not adversely classified and currently do not expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant a substandard classification. The Bank’s determination of the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the Division which can require a different classification and the establishment of additional loss allowances.

The aggregate amounts of the Bank’s classified and special mention loans (as determined by the Bank), and the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated, were as follows:

(2) | Includes non-performing loans.


Loans classified as substandard increased by $2.14 million to $5.32 million at September 30, 2019 from $3.18 million at September 30, 2018. At September 30, 2019, 44 loans were classified as substandard. Of the $5.32 million in loans classified as substandard at September 30, 2019, $3.03 million were on non-accrual status.  The largest loan classified as substandard at 
18

September 30, 2019 had a balance of $524,000 and was secured by a single family home in Pierce County. This loan was performing according to its payment terms at September 30, 2019.  The next largest loan classified as substandard at September 30, 2019 had a balance of $493,000 and was secured by a single family home in Pierce County. This loan was performing according to its payment terms at September 30, 2019.
Loans classified as special mention decreased by $576,000 to $2.55 million at September 30, 2019 from $3.12 million at September 30, 2018, primarily as a result of loans being upgraded to an improved risk grade category and loans being paid off during the year ended September 30, 2019. At September 30, 2019, ten loans were classified as special mention. The largest loan classified as special mention at September 30, 2019 had a balance of $623,000 and was secured by land in Grays Harbor County. This loan was performing according to its payment terms at September 30, 2019. The next largest loan classified as special mention at September 30, 2019 had a balance of $561,000 and was secured by a one- to four-family property in Pierce County. This loan was performing according to its payment terms at September 30, 2019.
Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  The Bank has established a comprehensive methodology for the determination of provisions for loan losses that takes into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance.  The Bank’s methodology for assessing the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses is based on its historic loss experience for various loan segments; adjusted for changes in economic conditions, delinquency rates and other factors.  Using these loss estimate factors, management develops a range of probable loss for each loan category.  Certain individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured are evaluated individually with loss exposure based on estimated discounted cash flows or net realizable collateral values.  The total estimated range of loss based on these two components of the analysis is compared to the loan loss allowance balance.  Based on this review, management will adjust the allowance as necessary.
In originating loans, the Bank recognizes that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, general economic conditions and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the security for the loan.  The Bank increases its allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against the Bank's operating income.
The Board of Directors reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly based on management's assessment of current economic conditions, past loss and collection experience, and risk characteristics of the loan portfolio.
At September 30, 2019, the Bank’s allowance for loan losses totaled $9.69 million.  The Bank’s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans receivable and non-performing loans was 1.08% and 319.49%, respectively, at September 30, 2019 and 1.30% and 723.61%, respectively, at September 30, 2018. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans receivable was primarily due to loans acquired in the South Sound Acquisition and improvements in several underlying credit quality metrics in the loan portfolio. In accordance with GAAP, loans acquired in the South Sound Acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loan's contractual amount, of which a portion reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value and as a result no allowance for loans losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or the related allowance coverage ratios, however we believe it should be considered when comparing the current ratios to similar ratios in periods prior to the South Sound Acquisition. The remaining fair value discount on loans acquired in the South Sound Acquisition was $1.39 million at September 30, 2019.
Management believes that the amount maintained in the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to make its determinations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary, and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.
While the Bank believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with GAAP, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing the Bank's loan portfolio, will not request the Bank to increase significantly its allowance for loan losses.  In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above.  Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect the Bank's financial condition and results of operations.

Investment Activities
The investment policies of the Bank are established and monitored by the Board of Directors.  The policies are designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity, to generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and to compliment the Bank’s lending activities.  These policies dictate the criteria for classifying investments in debt securities as either available for sale or held to maturity.  The policies permit investment in various types of liquid assets permissible under applicable regulations, which include U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certificates of deposit of insured banks, federal funds, mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds and mutual funds.  The Company's investment policy also permits investment in equity securities in certain financial service companies.
Investments in equity securities are stated at fair value. Prior to October 1, 2018, changes in the fair value of investments in equity securities were excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of income tax effects. On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 and reclassified its mutual funds as investments in equity securities. Beginning October 1, 2018, changes in the fair value of investments in equity securities are recorded in other non-interest income.
At September 30, 2019, the Bank’s portfolio of investments in debt securities totaled $53.63 million, consisting of $3.00 million of U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities held to maturity, $28.10 million of mortgage-backed securities held to maturity, and $22.53 million of mortgage-backed securities available for sale.  The Bank does not maintain a trading account for any investments.  This compares with a total investment portfolio of $13.96 million at September 30, 2018, consisting of $10.97 million of U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities held to maturity, $1.85 million of mortgage-backed securities held to maturity, $917,000 of mutual funds available for sale and $237,000 of mortgage-backed securities available for sale.

There were no securities which had an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of the Bank’s total equity at September 30, 2019.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank had $317,000 of private label mortgage-backed securities in the held to maturity investment securities portfolio of which $294,000 were on non-accrual status.  For additional information regarding investment securities, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our investment securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates and result in losses” and Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds
General.  Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of the Bank's funds for lending and other investment purposes.  Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and money market conditions.  Borrowings through the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ("FRB") may be used to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources.
Deposit Accounts.  Substantially all of the Bank's depositors are residents of Washington.  Deposits are attracted from within the Bank's market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including money market deposit accounts, checking accounts, regular savings accounts and certificates of deposit.  Deposit account terms vary, according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors.  In determining the terms of its deposit accounts, the Bank considers current market interest rates, profitability to the Bank, matching deposit and loan products and its customer preferences and concerns.  The Bank actively seeks consumer and commercial checking accounts through checking account acquisition marketing programs. The Bank also has checking accounts owned by businesses associated with the marijuana (or Initiative-502) industry in Washington State. It is generally permissible in Washington State to handle accounts associated with this industry in compliance with federal regulatory guidelines.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank had $31.43 million, or 2.9% of total deposits, from businesses associated with the marijuana industry. See "Risk Factors- We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that could increase our costs of operations."
At September 30, 2019, the Bank had $29.21 million of jumbo certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more.  The Bank had brokered certificates of deposit totaling $3.20 million, brokered non-interest bearing demand accounts totaling $7.74 million, and $8.39 million in brokered reciprocal money market deposits at September 30, 2019. The Bank believes that its jumbo certificates of deposit, which represented 2.7% of total deposits at September 30, 2019, present similar interest rate risks as compared to its other deposits.

Borrowings.  Deposits and loan repayments are generally the primary source of funds for the Bank's lending and investment activities and for general business purposes.  The Bank has the ability to use borrowings from the FHLB to supplement its supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements.  The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions.  As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for borrowings on the security of such stock and certain mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the U.S. government) provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met.  Borrowings are made pursuant to several different credit programs.  Each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities.  Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of borrowings are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. At September 30, 2019, the Bank maintained an uncommitted credit facility with the FHLB that provided for immediately available borrowings up to an aggregate amount to 45% of the Bank’s total assets, limited by available collateral. The Bank had no outstanding balance on this borrowing line at September 30, 2019. The Bank also has a Letter of Credit ("LOC") of up to $23.00 million with the FHLB for the purpose of collateralizing Washington State public deposits. all of which was available to be drawn upon at September 30, 2019. The LOC amount reduces the Bank's available FHLB borrowings. The Bank maintains a short-term borrowing line of credit with the FRB with total credit based on eligible collateral.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank had no outstanding balance and $84.36 million in unused borrowing capacity on this borrowing line of credit. A short-term borrowing line of credit of $10.00 million is also maintained at Pacific Coast Bankers' Bank ("PCBB"). The Bank had no outstanding balance on this borrowing line of credit at September 30, 2019. 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding borrowings, including repurchase agreements, by the Bank at the end of and during the periods indicated:

Bank Owned Life Insurance
The Bank has purchased life insurance policies covering certain officers.  These policies are recorded at their cash surrender value, net of any cash surrender charges.  Increases in cash surrender value, net of policy premiums, and proceeds from death benefits are recorded in non-interest income.  At September 30, 2019, the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) was $21.01 million.

How We Are Regulated
General.  As a bank holding company, Timberland Bancorp is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve. Timberland Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. As a state-chartered savings bank, the Bank is subject to regulation and oversight by the Division and the applicable provisions of Washington law and regulations of the Division adopted thereunder.  The Bank also is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of the Bank to the maximum extent permitted by law, and requirements established by the Federal Reserve.  State law and regulations govern the Bank's ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices.  Under state law, savings banks in Washington also generally have all of the powers that federal savings banks have under federal laws and regulations.  The Bank is subject to periodic examination and reporting requirements by and of the Division and the FDIC. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve with responsibility for the implementation of federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and DFI with respect to its compliance with federal and state consumer financial protection laws and regulations.
The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to Timberland Bancorp and the Bank. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this report do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the U.S. Congress or the Washington State Legislature that may affect the operations of Timberland Bancorp and the Bank. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the FDIC, DFI, Federal Reserve and the CFPB. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect the Company's and the Bank's operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur.

Regulation of the Bank
The Bank, as a state-chartered savings bank, is subject to regulation and oversight by the FDIC and the Division extending to all aspects of its operations. 
Federal and State Enforcement Authority and Actions. As part of its supervisory authority over Washington-chartered savings banks, the Division may initiate enforcement proceedings to obtain a consent order to cease and desist against an institution believed to have engaged in unsafe and unsound practices or to have violated a law, regulation, or other regulatory limit, including a written agreement. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against insured institutions for similar reasons and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Both of these agencies may utilize less formal supervisory tools to address their concerns about the condition, operations or compliance status of a savings bank.

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC.  The deposit insurance fund (the "DIF") of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in the Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured deposit ownership right or category.  As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. The Bank's deposit insurance premiums for the year ended September 30, 2019 were $187,000.  
Under the FDIC's system for assessing insurance premiums, insured institutions that do not have assets of $10 billion are assessed based on CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios. For these institutions, total base assessment rates range from 3 to 30 basis points, subject to adjustment. Stronger institutions pay lower rates, while riskier institutions pay higher rates. Assessments are applied to an institution's assessment base, which is its average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against banks and savings associations. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Bank's deposit insurance.
A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank.  
26

Capital Requirements.  Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), the Bank became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the FDIC, which created a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital, increased the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, created an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios, and changed what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. The Federal Reserve adopted parallel regulations for bank holding companies. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the "Basel III" requirements. 
Under the capital regulations, the required minimum capital level ratios are (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on Call Reports, minus certain items deducted from Tier 1 capital.
In addition to the minimum capital requirements, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer that consists of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares and paying certain discretionary bonuses. At September 30, 2019 the conservation buffer was an amount greater than 2.5%.
In addition to the capital requirements, there have been a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments of qualifying capital. The Bank did not have any of these instruments at September 30, 2019. Servicing rights and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital, subject to a four-year transition period. CET1 capital consists of Tier 1 capital less all capital components that are not considered common equity. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities, subject to a four-year transition period. Because of the Bank's asset size, it was not considered an advanced approaches banking organization and elected in the first quarter of calendar year 2015 to take the one-time option of deciding to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities in its capital calculations.
The following table compares the Bank's actual capital amounts at September 30, 2019 to its minimum regulatory capital requirements at that date (Dollars in thousands):

 | Actual | | Regulatory Minimum To Be "Adequately Capitalized | | Regulatory Minimum To Be "Well Capitalized" Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions
 | Amount | | Ratio | | Amount | | Ratio | | Amount | | Ratio
Leverage Capital Ratio: | | | | | | | | | | | 
Tier 1 capital | $ | 152,926 | | | 12.47 | % | | $ | 49,044 | | | 4.00 | % | $ | 61,305 | 5.00 | %
Risk-based Capital Ratios: | | | | | | | | | | | 
CET1 capital | 152,926 | | | 18.10 | | | 38,019 | | | 4.50 | | | 54,916 | | 6.50 
Tier 1 capital | 152,926 | | | 18.10 | | | 50,692 | | | 6.00 | | | 67,589 | | 8.00 
Total capital | 162,857 | | | 19.28 | | | 67,589 | | | 8.00 | | | 84,487 | | 10.00 

The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution's capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. Management of the Bank believes that, under the current regulations, the Bank will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future.
27

For additional information regarding the Bank's regulatory capital requirements, see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
In September 2019, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies adopted a final rule, effective January 1, 2020, creating a community bank leverage ratio ("CBLR") for institutions that have total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less and meet other qualifying criteria. The CBLR provides a simple measure of capital adequacy for qualifying institutions. Qualifying institutions that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage capital ratio of greater than 9% will be considered to have satisfied the general applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the regulatory agencies' capital rules and to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements. Management is still reviewing the CBLR framework.
Prompt Corrective Action.  Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories:  well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.  An institution’s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors.  An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. Under these regulations, an institution is treated as well capitalized if it has (i) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more, (ii) a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or more, (iii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, and (iv) a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more, and is not subject to any of certain specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized.  Failure by an institution to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator.  Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements.  Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements.
At September 30, 2019, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations of the FDIC.  For additional information regarding the Bank's minimum regulatory capital requirements, see "Capital Requirements" above and Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB, one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions, each serving as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region.  The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System.  It makes loans to members in accordance with policies and procedures, established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board.  All borrowings from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB.  In addition, all long-term borrowings are required to provide funds for residential home financing.  See “Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds – Borrowings" above.
As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB based on the Bank's asset size and level of borrowings from the FHLB.  At September 30, 2019, the Bank had $1.44 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement.  The FHLB pays dividends quarterly, and the Bank received $51,000 in dividends during the year ended September 30, 2019. 
The Federal Home Loan Banks continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on borrowings targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects.  These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future.  These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future.  A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB stock may result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital.
Standards for Safety and Soundness.  The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to: internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.  The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.  Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution’s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities.  The information security program also must be 
28

designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information.  Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems.  If the FDIC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, it may require the Bank to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.  FDIC regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.  Management of the Bank is not aware of any conditions relating to these safety and soundness standards which would require submission of a plan of compliance.

Real Estate Lending Standards.  FDIC regulations require the Bank to adopt and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for real estate loans.  These standards, which must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value ratio limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements.  The Bank is obligated to monitor conditions in its real estate markets to ensure that its standards continue to be appropriate for current market conditions.  The Bank’s Board of Directors is required to review and approve the Bank’s standards at least annually.  The FDIC has published guidelines for compliance with these regulations, including supervisory limitations on loan-to-value ratios for different categories of real estate loans.  Under the guidelines, the aggregate amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios should not exceed 100% of total capital, and the total of all loans for commercial, agricultural, multi-family or other non-one- to four-family residential properties in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratio should not exceed 30% of total capital.  Loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratio limitations must be identified in the Bank’s records and reported at least quarterly to the Bank’s Board of Directors.  The Bank is in compliance with the record and reporting requirements.  As of September 30, 2019, the Bank’s aggregate loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios were 0.3% of total capital and the Bank's loans on commercial, agricultural, multi-family or other non-one- to four-family residential properties in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value ratios were 0.1% of total capital.
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions.  Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks.  An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership, the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank's total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage or bankers' blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution owned by another FDIC-insured institution if certain requirements are met.
Under the law of Washington State, Washington-chartered savings banks may exercise any of the powers of Washington-chartered commercial banks, national banks and federally-chartered savings banks, subject to the approval of the Director in certain situations.  In addition,Washington-chartered savings banks may charge the maximum interest rate allowable for loans and other extensions of credit by federally-chartered financial institutions to Washington residents.
Environmental Issues Associated With Real Estate Lending.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste.  However,  Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term “owner and operator” excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site.  Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this “secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan.
To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property.
Federal Reserve System.  The Federal Reserve requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits.  These reserves may be in the form of cash or non-interest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank.  Negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank.  As of September 30, 2019, the Bank’s deposit with the Federal Reserve and vault cash exceeded its Regulation D reserve requirements.
29

Affiliate Transactions.  Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies.  Transactions deemed to be a “covered transaction” under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus and, with respect to the parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary’s capital and surplus.  Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts.  Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions between a bank and its affiliates listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related regulations must be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates.
Community Reinvestment Act. Banks are also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank’s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  The regulatory agency’s assessment of the bank’s record is made available to the public.  Further, a bank’s performance must be considered in connection with a bank’s application to, among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution.  The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating during its most recent examination.
Dividends.  Dividends from the Bank constitute the major source of funds available for dividends which may be paid to Company shareholders.  The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon the Bank's earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. According to Washington law, the Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (i) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (ii) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the Division. In addition, dividends on the Bank's capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of the Bank, without the approval of the Director of the Division. Dividends payable by the Bank can be limited or prohibited if the Bank does not meet the capital conservation buffer requirement.
The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period will be strongly affected by the Bank's management policy of maintaining a strong capital position.  Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be “undercapitalized,” as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations.  Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.
Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations.  The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers.  While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing.  These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights.

Regulation of the Company

       General.  The Company, as the sole shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve.  Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that the Company limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of the Bank.
As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and any additional information required by the Federal Reserve and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank 
30

subsidiaries).  In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
BHCA.  The Company is supervised by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA.  Federal Reserve policy requires that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner.  In addition, the Federal Reserve provides that bank holding companies should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by being prepared to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity, and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks.  A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations or both. The Dodd-Frank Act essentially codified this policy.
Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  These activities generally include, among others, operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, escrow company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit related insurance; leasing property on a full payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers.
Acquisitions.  The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries.  A bank holding company that meets certain supervisory and financial standards and elects to be designated as a financial holding company may also engage in certain securities, insurance and merchant banking activities and other activities determined to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities.  
Interstate Banking.  The Federal Reserve may approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than such holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state except with respect to the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period, not exceeding five years, specified by the law of the host state.  The Federal Reserve may not approve an application if the applicant controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the U.S. or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch.  Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies.  Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law.

         The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to June 1, 1997 which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches will be permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions.  Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions are also generally subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above.
Dividends.  Federal Reserve policy limits the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition, and that it is inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends.  Under Washington corporate law, the Company generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than its total liabilities. The capital conservation buffer requirement can also limit dividends.
Stock Repurchases.  Bank holding companies, except for certain “well-capitalized” and highly rated bank holding companies, are required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of their consolidated net worth.  The Federal Reserve may disapprove a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or 
31

would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve.  
Capital Requirements.  As a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve, the Company is subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. For a bank holding company with less than $3.00 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis, and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary bank to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If the Company were subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $3.00 billion or more in assets, at September 30, 2019, the Company would have exceeded all regulatory requirements. 
The following table presents the regulatory capital ratios for the Company as of September 30, 2019 (Dollars in thousands):

 | Actual 
 | Amount | | Ratio
Leverage Capital Ratio: | | | 
Tier 1 capital | $ | 155,468 | | | 12.65 | %
Risk-based Capital Ratios: | | | 
CET1 capital | 155,468 | | | 18.40 | 
Tier 1 capital | 155,468 | | | 18.40 | 
Total capital | 165,399 | | | 19.57 |

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank-Act imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions, and mandated new capital regulations discussed above under “Regulation and Supervision of the Bank - Capital Requirements.” In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, such as Timberland Bancorp, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time.
2018 Regulatory Reform. In May 2018 the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “2018 Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the 2018 Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for community banks such as the Bank, and their holding companies.
The 2018 Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single CBLR of between 8 and 10 percent, as described above. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the CBLR will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. 
The 2018 Act also expands the category of holding companies that may rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying holding company 
32

may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. A major effect of this change is to exclude such holding companies from the minimum capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the 2018 Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the 2018 Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the 2018 Act and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.

Taxation
Federal Taxation

General.  The Company and the Bank report their operations on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations.  The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. For businesses, the Tax Act reduces the corporate federal income tax rate from a maximum of 35.0% to a flat 21.0%. The corporate federal income tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018. Since the Company has a fiscal year end of September 30, the reduced federal corporate income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was the result of the application of a blended federal statutory tax rate of 24.5%, which was based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and corresponding number of days in the fiscal year before and after enactment, and then a 21.0% federal corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter. The Tax Act also required a revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate income tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. As a result of the Company’s revaluation, the net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) was reduced through an increase to the provision for income taxes. The revaluation of our DTA balance resulted in a one-time increase for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 to federal income tax of $548,000. For additional details see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 
Dividends-Received Deduction. The Company may exclude from its income 100.0% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.  The corporate dividends-received deduction is generally 70.0% in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return, except that if the Company or the Bank owns more than 20.0% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend, then 80.0% of any dividends received may be deducted.
Audits.  The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examination by tax authorities for years ended on or before September 30, 2015.
Washington Taxation
The Company and the Bank are subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington law at the rate of 1.5% of gross receipts at September 30, 2019. This business and occupation tax rate is scheduled to increase to 1.8% of gross receipts starting on January 1, 2020. Interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties, certain residential mortgage-backed securities, and certain U.S. government and agency securities is not subject to this tax.
Competition
The Bank operates in an intensely competitive market for the attraction of deposits (generally its primary source of lendable funds) and in the origination of loans.  Historically, its most direct competition for deposits has come from commercial banks, thrift institutions and credit unions in its primary market area.  In times of high interest rates, the Bank experiences additional significant competition for investors' funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.  The Bank's competition for loans comes principally from mortgage bankers, commercial banks, thrift institutions and credit unions.  Such competition for deposits and the origination of loans may limit the Bank's future growth and earnings prospects.
33

Subsidiary Activities
The Bank has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Timberland Service Corporation (“Timberland Service”), whose primary function is to provide escrow services. 
Personnel
As of September 30, 2019, the Bank had 286 full-time employees and 12 part-time and on-call employees.  The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit, and the Bank believes its relationship with its employees is good.
Executive Officers of the Registrant
