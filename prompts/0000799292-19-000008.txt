Item 1. BUSINESS
General
M/I Homes, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is one of the nation’s leading builders of single-family homes. The Company was incorporated, through predecessor entities, in 1973 and commenced homebuilding activities in 1976. Since that time, the Company has sold over 111,400 homes.
The Company consists of two distinct operations: homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding operations are aggregated for reporting purposes into three reporting segments - the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Southern regions. Our financial services operations support our homebuilding operations by providing mortgage loans and title services to the customers of our homebuilding operations and are reported as an independent segment. Please see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the financial and operating results for each of our reporting segments.
Our homebuilding operations comprise the most significant portion of our business, representing 98% of consolidated revenue in 2018 and 97% in 2017. We design, market, construct and sell single-family homes and attached townhomes to first-time, millennial, move-up, empty-nester and luxury buyers. In addition to home sales, our homebuilding operations generate revenue from the sale of land and lots. We use the term “home” to refer to a single-family residence, whether it is a single-family home or other type of residential property, and we use the term “community” to refer to a single development in which we construct homes. We primarily construct homes in planned development communities and mixed-use communities. We are currently offering homes for sale in 209 communities within 16 markets located in ten states. Our average sales price of homes delivered during 2018 was $384,000, and the average sales price of our homes in backlog at December 31, 2018 was $409,000. We offer homes ranging from a base sales price of approximately $180,000 to $1,110,000 and believe that this range of price points allows us to appeal to and attract a wide range of buyers. We believe that we distinguish ourselves from competitors by offering homes in select areas with a high level of design and construction quality, providing superior customer service and offering mortgage and title services in order to fully serve our customers. In our experience, our product offerings and customer service make the homebuying process more efficient for our customers.
Our financial services operations generate revenue primarily from originating and selling mortgages and collecting fees for title insurance and closing services. We offer mortgage banking services to our homebuyers through our 100%-owned subsidiary, M/I Financial, LLC (“M/I Financial”). We offer title services through subsidiaries that are either 100% or majority owned by the Company. Our financial services operations accounted for 2% of our consolidated revenues in 2018 and 3% in 2017. See the “Financial Services” section below for additional information regarding our financial services operations.
Our principal executive offices are located at 3 Easton Oval, Suite 500, Columbus, Ohio 43219. The telephone number of our corporate headquarters is (614) 418-8000 and our website address is www.mihomes.com. Information on our website is not a part of and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.

Markets
For reporting purposes, our 16 homebuilding divisions are aggregated into the following three segments:

Region | Market/Division | Year Operations Commenced
Midwest | Columbus, Ohio | 1976 
Midwest | Cincinnati, Ohio | 1988 
Midwest | Indianapolis, Indiana | 1988 
Midwest | Chicago, Illinois | 2007 
Midwest | Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota | 2015 
Midwest | Detroit, Michigan | 2018 
Southern | Tampa, Florida | 1981 
Southern | Orlando, Florida | 1984 
Southern | Sarasota, Florida | 2016 
Southern | Houston, Texas | 2010 
Southern | San Antonio, Texas | 2011 
Southern | Austin, Texas | 2012 
Southern | Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas | 2013 
Mid-Atlantic | Charlotte, North Carolina | 1985 
Mid-Atlantic | Raleigh, North Carolina | 1986 
Mid-Atlantic | Washington, D.C. | 1991 

We believe we have experienced management teams in each of our divisions with local market expertise. Our business requires in-depth knowledge of local markets to acquire land in desirable locations and on favorable terms, engage subcontractors, plan communities that meet local demand, anticipate consumer tastes in specific markets, and assess local regulatory environments. Although we centralize certain functions (such as accounting, human resources, legal, land purchase approval, and risk management) to benefit from economies of scale, our local management, generally under the direction of an Area President and supervised by a Region President, exercises considerable autonomy in identifying land acquisition opportunities, developing and implementing product and sales strategies, and controlling costs.
Industry Overview and Current Market Conditions
Housing market conditions continued to be favorable through the first half of 2018, as evidenced by our strong spring selling season. However, beginning in second half of 2018, the homebuilding industry experienced a softening in demand, after adjusting for normal seasonality, that we believe was a result of the rise in mortgage interest rates in 2018 and higher home prices which created affordability challenges for some prospective buyers. Despite this softening in demand in the second half of 2018, we also believe that many of the fundamentals supporting continued growth in demand remain favorable, including high consumer confidence, growth in employment, wage increases, and a limited supply of new and existing homes. Company-wide, our absorption pace of sales per community for 2018 remained at a pace consistent with 2017.
Business Strategy
Although higher prices and rising interest rates began to adversely impact new home sales in the second half of 2018, we believe that other fundamentals underlying housing demand, linked to low unemployment and higher wages, remain favorable. We remain focused on increasing our profitability by generating additional revenue and improving overhead operating leverage, continuing to expand our market share, shifting product mix to include more affordable designs, investing in attractive land opportunities and increasing our number of average active communities. Consistent with our focus on improving long-term financial results, we expect to emphasize the following strategic business objectives in 2019:

• | profitably growing our presence in our existing markets, including opening new communities;


• | expanding the availability of our more affordable Smart Series homes;


• | reviewing new markets for additional investment opportunities;


• | maintaining a strong balance sheet; and


• | emphasizing customer service, product quality and design, and premier locations.

However, we can provide no assurance that the positive trends reflected in our financial and operating metrics in 2017 and 2018 will continue in 2019.

Sales and Marketing
During 2018, we continued to focus our marketing efforts on first-time and move-up homebuyers, including home designs targeted to first-time, millennial and empty-nester homebuyers. We market and sell our homes primarily under the M/I Homes and Showcase Collection (exclusively by M/I Homes) brands. In addition, the Hans Hagen brand is used in older communities in our Minneapolis/St. Paul market, and following our acquisition of the homebuilding assets and operations of Pinnacle Homes, a privately-held homebuilder in the Detroit, Michigan market in March 2018, the Pinnacle Homes brand is used in that market in connection with the sale of homes in active communities as of the date of the acquisition. Our marketing efforts are directed at driving interest in and preference for the M/I Homes brands over other homebuilders or the resale market.
We provide our homebuyers with the following products, programs and services which we believe differentiate our brand: (1) homes with high quality construction located in attractive areas and desirable communities that are supported by our industry leading 15-year transferable structural warranty in all of our markets other than Texas and a 10-year transferable structural warranty in our Texas markets; (2) our Whole Home Building Standards which are designed to deliver features and benefits that satisfy the buyer’s expectation for a better-built home, including a more eco-friendly and energy efficient home that we believe will generally save our customers up to 30% on their energy costs compared to a home that is built to minimum code requirements; (3) our Design Studios and Design Consultants that assist our homebuyers in selecting product and design options; (4) fully furnished model homes and highly-trained sales consultants to build the buyer’s confidence and enhance the quality of the homebuying experience; (5) our mortgage financing programs that we offer through M/I Financial, including competitive fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans; (6) our Ready Now Homes program which offers homebuyers the opportunity to close on certain new homes in 60 days or less; and (7) our unwavering focus on customer care and customer satisfaction.
By offering Whole Home Energy-Efficient Homes to our customers, we enable our homebuyers to save on their energy costs (the second largest cost of home ownership) compared to a home that is built to minimum code requirements. We use independent RESNET-Certified Raters and the HERS (Home Energy Rating System) Index, the national standard for energy efficiency, to measure the performance of our homes, including insulation, ventilation, air tightness, and the heating and cooling system. Our divisions’ average scores are generally lower (and, therefore, better) than the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star target standard of 72-75 or the average score for a resale home (130 or higher).
To further enhance the homebuying process, we operate Design Studios in a majority of our markets. Our Design Studios allow our homebuyers to select from thousands of product and design options that are available for purchase as part of the original construction of their homes. Our centers are staffed with Design Consultants who help our homebuyers select the right combination of options to meet their budget, lifestyle and design sensibilities. In most of our markets, we offer our homebuyers the option to consider and make design planning decisions using our Envision online design tool. We believe this tool is helpful for prospective buyers to use during the planning phase and makes their actual visit to our design centers more productive and efficient as our consultants are able to view the buyer’s preliminary design selections and pull samples in advance of the buyer’s visit. 
We also invest in designing and decorating fully-furnished and distinctive model homes intended to create an atmosphere reflecting how people live today and help our customers imagine the possibilities for a “home of their own, just the way they dreamed it.” We carefully select the interior decorating and design of our model homes to reflect the lifestyles of our prospective buyers. We believe these models showcase our homes at their maximum livability and potential and provide ideas and inspiration for our customers to incorporate valuable design options into their new home.
Our company-employed sales consultants are trained and prepared to meet the buyer’s expectations and build the buyer’s confidence by fully explaining the features and benefits of our homes, helping each buyer determine which home best suits the buyer’s needs, explaining the construction process, and assisting the buyer in choosing the best financing option. Significant attention is given to the ongoing training of all sales personnel to assure a high level of professionalism and product knowledge. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 235 home sales consultants.
We also offer specialized mortgage financing programs through M/I Financial to assist our homebuyers. We offer conventional financing options along with programs offered by the Federal Housing Authority (“FHA”), U.S. Veterans Administration (“VA”), United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and state housing bond agencies. M/I Financial offers our homebuyers “one-stop” shopping by providing mortgage and title services for the purchase of their home, which we believe saves our customers both time and money. By working with many of the major mortgage providers in the country, we seek to offer our homebuyers unique programs with below-market financing options that are more competitive than what homebuyers could obtain on their own. With respect to title services, the Company’s title subsidiaries work closely with our homebuilding divisions so that we are able to provide an organized and efficient home delivery process.
We also build inventory homes in most of our communities to offer homebuyers the opportunity to close on certain new homes in 60 days or less. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who require a home delivery 
 5

within a short time frame and allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market. We determine our inventory homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality and our past experience in the market. We maintain a level of inventory homes in each community based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust inventory homes on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant.
We seek to keep our homebuyers actively involved in the construction of their new home, providing them with continued communication throughout the design and construction process. Our goal is to put the buyer first and enhance the total homebuying experience. We believe prompt and courteous responses to homebuyers’ needs throughout the homebuying process reduce post-delivery repair costs, enhance our reputation for quality and service, and encourage repeat and referral business from homebuyers and the real estate community.
Finally, we believe our ultimate differentiator comes from the principles our company was founded upon -- integrity and delivering superior customer service and a quality product. Our customer satisfaction scores are measured by an independent third-party company at both 30 days and 6 months after delivery to hold us accountable for building a home of the highest quality. 
We market our homes using traditional media such as newspapers, direct mail, billboards, radio and television. The particular media used differs from market to market based on area demographics and other competitive factors. In 2018, we significantly increased the reach of our website through enhanced search engine optimization, search engine marketing, and display advertising. We have reinforced our presence on referral sites, such as Zillow.com and NewHomeSource.com, to drive sales leads to our internet sales associates. We also use email marketing to maintain communication with existing prospects and customers. We use our social media presence to communicate to potential homebuyers the experiences of customers who have purchased our homes and to provide content about our homes and design features.
Product Lines, Design and Construction
Our residential communities are generally located in suburban areas that are easily accessible through public and personal transportation. Our communities are designed as neighborhoods that fit existing land characteristics. We strive to achieve diversity among architectural styles within a community by offering a variety of house models and several exterior design options for each model. We also preserve existing trees and foliage whenever practicable. Normally, homes of the same type or color may not be built next to each other. We believe our communities have attractive entrances with distinctive signage and landscaping and that our attention to community detail avoids a “development” appearance and gives each community a diversified neighborhood appearance.
We offer homes ranging from a base sales price of approximately $180,000 to $1,110,000 and from approximately 1,200 to 5,500 square feet. In addition to single-family detached homes, we also offer attached townhomes in some of our markets. By offering a wide range of homes, we are able to attract first-time, millennial, move-up, empty-nester and luxury homebuyers. It is our goal to sell more than one home to our buyers, and we believe we have had success in this strategy.
We devote significant resources to the research, design and development of our homes to meet the demands of our buyers and evolving market requirements. Across all of our divisions, we currently offer over 750 different floor plans designed to reflect current lifestyles and design trends. Our Showcase Collection is designed for our move-up and luxury homebuyers and offers more design options, larger floor plans, and a higher-end product line of homes in upscale communities. In addition, we are developing new floor plans and communities specifically for the growing empty-nester market. These plans (primarily ranch and main floor master bedroom type plans) focus on move-down buyers, are smaller in size, and feature outdoor living potential, fewer bedrooms, and better community amenities. Our homebuilding divisions share successful plans with other divisions, when appropriate.
We are continuing to implement our “Smart Series” floor plans of smaller square footage to target a more affordable sales price in several of our markets. Our “Smart Series” is intended to offer buyers excellent value, great locations, and pre-selected packages of upgraded finishes and appliances. Our “Smart Series” targets entry-level and move-down buyers and focuses significant attention on current trends, livability and offering design flexibility to our customers. We are actively selling “Smart Series” floor plans in the majority of our markets and they have become an important and successful part of our overall product lineup.
Our new “City Collection” floor plans offer a unique and upscale urban lifestyle by utilizing narrow lots, detached rear garages and thoughtfully designed interiors. Our “City Collection” enables us to participate in new infill development opportunities that extend beyond our traditional suburban markets.
We design all of our product lines to reduce production costs and construction cycle times while adhering to our quality standards and using materials and construction techniques that reflect our commitment to more environmentally conscious homebuilding methods. All of our homes are constructed according to proprietary designs that meet the applicable FHA and VA requirements 
 6

and all local building codes. We attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials. Our raw materials consist primarily of lumber, concrete and similar construction materials, and while these materials are generally available from a variety of sources, we have reduced construction and administrative costs by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors. Our homes are constructed according to standardized prototypes which are designed and engineered to provide innovative product design while attempting to minimize costs of construction and control product consistency and availability. We generally employ subcontractors for the installation of site improvements and the construction of homes. The construction of each home is supervised by a Personal Construction Supervisor who reports to a Production Manager, both of whom are employees of the Company. Our Personal Construction Supervisors manage the scheduling and construction process. Subcontractor work is performed pursuant to written agreements that require our subcontractors to comply with all applicable laws and labor practices, follow local building codes and permits, and meet performance, warranty, and insurance requirements. The agreements generally specify a fixed price for labor and materials, and are structured to provide price protection for a majority of the higher-cost phases of construction for homes in our backlog. 
We begin construction on a majority of our homes after we have obtained a sales contract and preliminary oral confirmation from the buyer’s lender that financing should be approved. In certain markets, contracts may be accepted contingent upon the sale of an existing home, and construction may be authorized through a certain phase prior to satisfaction of that contingency. The construction of our homes typically takes approximately four to six months from the start of construction to completion of the home, depending on the size and complexity of the particular home being built, weather conditions, and the availability of labor, materials, and supplies. We also construct inventory homes (i.e., homes started in the absence of an executed contract) to facilitate delivery of homes on an immediate-need basis under our Ready Now Homes program and to provide presentation of new products. For some prospective buyers, selling their existing home has become a less predictable process and, as a result, when they sell their home, they often need to find, buy and move into a new home in 60 days or less. Other buyers simply prefer the certainty provided by being able to fully visualize a home before purchasing it. Of the total number of homes closed in 2018 and 2017, 45% and 47%, respectively, were inventory homes which include both homes started as inventory homes and homes that started under a contract that were later cancelled and became inventory homes as a result. 
Backlog
We sell our homes under standard purchase contracts, which generally require a homebuyer deposit at the time of signing the contract. The amount of the deposit varies among markets and communities. We also generally require homebuyers to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrades for their homes. Most of our home purchase contracts stipulate that if a homebuyer cancels a contract with us, we have the right to retain the homebuyer’s deposits. However, we generally permit our homebuyers to cancel their obligations and obtain refunds of all or a portion of their deposits (unless home construction has started) in the event mortgage financing cannot be obtained within the period specified in their contract to maintain goodwill with the potential buyer.
Backlog consists of homes that are under contract but have not yet been delivered. Ending backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net new contracts (new contracts for homes less cancellations) generated during the current period minus the number of homes delivered during the current period. The backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations. Due to the seasonality of the homebuilding industry, the number of homes delivered has historically increased from the first to the fourth quarter in any year.
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 2,194 homes, with $896.7 million aggregate sales value, in backlog in various stages of completion, including homes that are under contract but for which construction had not yet begun. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 2,014 homes, with $791.3 million aggregate sales value, in backlog. Homes included in year-end backlog are typically included in homes delivered in the subsequent year.
Warranty
We provide certain warranties in connection with our homes and also perform inspections with the buyer of each home immediately prior to delivery and as needed after a home is delivered. The Company offers both a limited warranty program (“Home Builder’s Limited Warranty”) and a transferable structural limited warranty. The Home Builder’s Limited Warranty covers construction defects for a statutory period based on geographic market and state law (currently ranging from five to ten years for the states in which the Company operates) and includes a mandatory arbitration clause. The structural warranty is for 10 or 15 years for homes sold after December 1, 2015 and 10 or 30 years for homes sold after April 25, 1998 and on or before December 1, 2015. We also pass along to our homebuyers all warranties provided by the manufacturers or suppliers of components installed in each home. Although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects during their respective warranty periods, we are ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs during our applicable warranty period. Accordingly, we have estimated and established reserves for both our Home Builder’s Limited Warranty and potential future 
 7

structural warranty costs based on the number of home deliveries and historical data trends for our communities. In the case of the structural warranty, we also employ an actuary to assist in the determination of our future costs on an annual basis. Our warranty expense (excluding stucco-related repair costs in certain of our Florida communities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 (as more fully discussed in Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements)) was approximately 0.8% of total housing revenue in each of 2018 and 2017 and 0.9% of total housing revenue in 2016.
Land Acquisition and Development
We continuously evaluate land acquisition opportunities in the normal course of our homebuilding business, and we focus on both replenishing our lot positions and adding to our lot positions in key submarkets to expand our market share. Our goal is to maintain an approximate three to five-year supply of lots, including lots controlled under option contracts and purchase agreements, which we believe provides an appropriate horizon for addressing regulatory matters and land development and the subsequent build-out of the homes in each community, and allows us to manage our business plan for future home deliveries. 
We seek to meet our need for lots by obtaining advantageous land positions in desirable locations in a cost effective manner that is responsive to market conditions and maintains our financial strength and liquidity. Before acquiring land, we complete extensive comparative studies and analyses, which assist us in evaluating the economic feasibility of the land acquisition. We consider a number of factors, including projected rates of return, estimated gross margins, and projected pace of absorption and sales prices of the homes to be built, all of which are impacted by our evaluation of population and employment growth patterns, demographic trends and competing new home subdivisions and resales in the relevant sub-market.
We attempt to acquire land with a minimum cash investment and negotiate takedown options when available from sellers. We also restrict the use of guarantees or commitments in our land contracts to limit our financial exposure to the amounts invested in the property and pre-development costs during the life of the community we are developing. We believe this approach significantly reduces our risk. In addition, we generally obtain necessary development approvals before we acquire land. We acquire land primarily through contingent purchase agreements, which typically condition our obligation to purchase land upon approval of zoning, utilities, soil and subsurface conditions, environmental and wetland conditions, market analysis, development costs, title matters and other property-related criteria. All land and lot purchase agreements and the funding of land purchases require the approval of our corporate land acquisition committee, which is comprised of our senior management team and key operating and financial executives. Further details relating to our land option agreements are included in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In 2018, we continued to increase our investments in land acquisition, land development and housing inventory to meet demand and expand our operations in certain markets. In 2018 and 2017, we developed over 74% and 72%, respectively, of our lots internally, primarily due to a lack of availability of developed lots in desirable locations in the market. Raw land that requires development generally remains more available. In order to minimize our investment and risk of large exposure in a single location, we have periodically partnered with other land developers or homebuilders to share in the cost of land investment and development through joint ownership and development agreements, joint ventures, and other similar arrangements. For joint venture arrangements where a special purpose entity is established to own the property, we enter into limited liability company or similar arrangements (“LLCs”) with the other partners. Further details relating to our joint venture arrangements are included in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
During the development of lots, we are required by some municipalities and other governmental authorities to provide completion bonds or letters of credit for sewer, streets and other improvements. The development agreements under which we are required to provide completion bonds or letters of credit are generally not subject to a required completion date and only require that the improvements are in place in phases as homes are built and sold. In locations where development has progressed, the amount of development work remaining to be completed is typically less than the remaining amount of bonds or letters of credit due to timing delays in obtaining release of the bonds or letters of credit. 
Our ability to continue development activities over the long-term will depend upon, among other things, a suitable economic environment and our continued ability to locate suitable parcels of land, enter into options or agreements to purchase such land, obtain governmental approvals for such land, and consummate the acquisition and development of such land.

In the normal course of our homebuilding business, we balance the economic risk of owning lots and land with the necessity of having lots available for construction of our homes. The following table sets forth our land position in lots (including lots held in joint venture arrangements) at December 31, 2018:
 | Lots Owned | | 
Region | Developed Lots | Lots Under Development | Undeveloped Lots (a) | Total Lots Owned | Lots Under Contract | Total
Midwest | 3,119 | | 420 | | 2,105 | | 5,644 | 6,460 | 12,104
Southern | 2,171 | | 1,441 | | 2,895 | | 6,507 | 5,636 | 12,143
Mid-Atlantic | 721 | | 552 | | 639 | | 1,912 | 2,564 | 4,476 
Total | 6,011 | | 2,413 | | 5,639 | | 14,063 | 14,660 | 28,723


(a) | Includes our interest in raw land held by joint venture arrangements expected to be developed into 1,159 lots.

Financial Services
We sell our homes to customers who generally finance their purchases through mortgages. M/I Financial provides our customers with competitive financing and coordinates and expedites the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application, loan approval, and closing and title services. M/I Financial provides financing services in all of our housing markets. We believe that our ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales.
M/I Financial has been approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA and USDA to originate mortgages that are insured and/or guaranteed by these entities. In addition, M/I Financial has been approved by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) as a seller and servicer of mortgages and as a Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) issuer. Our agency approvals, along with a sub-servicing relationship, allow us to sell loans on either a servicing released or servicing retained basis. This option provides flexibility and additional financing options to our customers.
We also provide title and closing services to purchasers of our homes through our 100%-owned subsidiaries, TransOhio Residential Title Agency Ltd., M/I Title Agency Ltd., and M/I Title LLC, and our majority-owned subsidiary, Washington/Metro Residential Title Agency, LLC. Through these entities, we serve as a title insurance agent by providing title insurance policies and examination and closing services to purchasers of our homes in the Columbus, Cincinnati, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Tampa, Orlando, Sarasota, San Antonio, Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Austin, and Washington, D.C. markets.  In addition, TransOhio Residential Title Agency Ltd. provides examination and title insurance services to our housing markets in the Raleigh, Charlotte, Chicago and Indianapolis markets. We assume no underwriting risk associated with the title policies.
Corporate Operations
Our corporate operations and home office are located in Columbus, Ohio, where we perform the following functions at a centralized level:

• | establish strategy, goals and operating policies;


• | ensure brand integrity and consistency across all local and regional communications;


• | monitor and manage the performance of our operations;


• | allocate capital resources;


• | provide financing and perform all cash management functions for the Company, and maintain our relationship with lenders;


• | maintain centralized information and communication systems; and


• | maintain centralized financial reporting, internal audit functions, and risk management.

Competition
The homebuilding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. We operate as a top ten builder in the majority of our markets. We compete with numerous national, regional, and local homebuilders in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. Our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly-owned builders and developers, some of which have greater financial, marketing, land acquisition, and sales resources than us. Previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. Our financial services operations compete with other mortgage lenders to arrange financings for homebuyers. Principal competitive factors include interest rates and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer.

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our homebuilding and financial services operations are subject to compliance with numerous laws and regulations. Our homebuilding operations are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment, including storm water and surface water management, soil, groundwater and wetlands protection, subsurface conditions and air quality protection and enhancement. Environmental laws and existing conditions may result in delays, cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.
Our homebuilding operations are also subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building, design, construction, sales, and similar matters. These regulations increase the cost to produce and market our products, and in some instances, delay our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us. Counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards. In addition, our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. We may also experience extended timelines for receiving required approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that can delay our anticipated development and construction activities in our communities.
Our mortgage company and title insurance agencies are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations (including requirements for participation in programs offered by FHA, VA, USDA, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). These regulations restrict certain activities of our financial services operations as further described in our description of “Risk Factors” below in Item 1A. In addition, our financial services operations are subject to regulation at the state and federal level, including regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), with respect to specific origination, selling and servicing practices.
Seasonality
Our homebuilding operations experience significant seasonality and quarter-to-quarter variability in homebuilding activity levels. In general, homes delivered increase substantially in the second half of the year. We believe that this seasonality reflects the tendency of homebuyers to shop for a new home in the spring with the goal of closing in the fall or winter, as well as the scheduling of construction to accommodate seasonal weather conditions. Our financial services operations also experience seasonality because their loan originations correspond with the delivery of homes in our homebuilding operations.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we employed 1,359 people (including part-time employees), of which 1,085 were employed in homebuilding operations, 178 were employed in financial services and 97 were employed in management and administrative services. No employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference in, or otherwise made a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
