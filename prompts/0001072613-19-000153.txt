ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our principal business is the development, licensing and protection of our intellectual property assets.  We presently own sixty-five (65) patents including (i) our remote power patent ("Remote Power Patent") covering the delivery of power over Ethernet (PoE) cables for the purpose of remotely powering network devices, such as wireless access ports, IP phones and network based cameras; (ii) our Mirror Worlds patent portfolio (the "Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio") relating to foundational technologies that enable unified search and indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system; (iii) our Cox patent portfolio (the "Cox Patent Portfolio") relating to enabling technology for identifying media content on the Internet and taking further actions to be performed based on such identification; (iv) our M2M/IoT patent portfolio (the "M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio") relating to, among other things, enabling technology for authenticating, provisioning and using embedded sim cards in next generation IoT, Machine-to-Machine, and other mobile devices, including smartphones
 
 

tablets and computers; and (v) the QoS patents (the "QoS Patents") covering systems and methods for the transmission of audio, video and data in order to achieve high quality of service (QoS) over computer and telephony networks. In addition, we continually review opportunities to acquire or license additional intellectual property.
 
We have been actively engaged in the licensing of our Remote Power Patent (U.S. Patent No. 6,218,930).  We currently have twenty-seven (27) license  agreements with respect to our Remote Power Patent  which, among others, include license agreements with Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Dell Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Netgear, Inc., Microsemi Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., ShoreTel, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., Polycom, Inc. and Avaya, Inc. (see Notes J to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).  We have also entered into license agreements with Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corporation with respect to our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio (see "Business-Licensing - Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio" at page 11 hereof).  Our current strategy includes continuing our licensing efforts with respect to our intellectual property assets.  In addition, we continue to seek to acquire additional intellectual property assets to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize.  Our strategy includes working with inventors and patent owners to assist in the development and monetization of their patented technologies. We may also enter into strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property.  The form of such relationships may differ depending upon the opportunity and may include, among other things, a strategic investment in such third party, the provision of financing to such third party or the formation of a joint venture with such third party or others for the purpose of monetizing their intellectual property assets.
 
Our patent acquisition and development strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patents which management believes have the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities as we have achieved with respect to our Remote Power Patent and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio.  Our Remote Power Patent has generated licensing revenue of approximately $144,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2018.  Since our acquisition of Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio in May 2013, we have received licensing and other revenue from the portfolio of $47,150,000 through December 31, 2018.
 
At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $54,991,000 and working capital of $53,486,000.  Based on our current cash position, we believe that we will have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.  Based on our cash position, we continually review opportunities to acquire additional intellectual property as well as evaluate other strategic alternatives.
 
In December 2018, we agreed to make an investment of up to $5.0 million in a development stage biotechnology company with an exclusive license to thirty-six (36) patents (an additional thirty-one (31) patents are pending around the world) (see "Investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies" at pages 14-15 of this Annual Report).

On November 13, 2017, a jury empaneled in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas found that certain claims of our Remote Power Patent were invalid and not infringed by Hewlett-Packard (the "HP Jury Verdict").  On August 29, 2018, the District Court (i) granted our motion for judgment as a matter of law that our Remote Power Patent is valid, thereby overturning the HP Jury Verdict of invalidity and (ii) denied our motion for a new trial on infringement.  We have appealed the District Court's denial of our motion for a new trial on infringement to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see Note J[1] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).  The HP Jury Verdict had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash-flow for the year ended December 31, 2018 and will continue to do so for the life of our Remote Power Patent (March 2020) unless the District Court judgment of non-infringement is reversed on appeal.  We have been dependent upon our Remote Power Patent for a significant portion of our revenue.  As a result of the HP Jury Verdict several of our largest licensees, including Cisco, our largest licensee, notified us in late November 2017 and January 2018 that they will no longer make ongoing royalty payments to us pursuant to their license agreements.  If we successfully overturn the District Court order of non-infringement in our appeal to the Federal Circuit, certain licensees of the Remote Power Patent, including Cisco, will be obligated to pay us ongoing royalties and all royalties that accrued but were not paid following (and prior to) the HP Jury Verdict in November 2017.  If we are unable to reverse the District Court order of non-infringement on appeal, or there is an arbitration ruling that certain of our licensees, including Cisco, are relieved of their obligations to pay royalties and the District Court order of non-infringement is not subsequently reversed on appeal, our business, results of operations and cash-flow will continue to be materially adversely effected (see Note [J1] and Note J[2] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
 
Consistent with our prior view, the District Court decision overturning the HP Jury Verdict on invalidity as referenced above confirmed the obligations of certain licensees to pay us all prior unpaid royalties, including those that accrued after the date of the HP Jury Verdict (November 13, 2017), as well as future royalties through the expiration of the Remote Power Patent in March 2020 (see Note A and Note J[1] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).  Notwithstanding the District Court decision overturning the HP Jury Verdict on validity, Dell Inc. refused to pay us all unpaid royalties that accrued prior to and after the HP Verdict and in November 2018 we instituted litigation against Dell to collect such unpaid royalties (see Note J[5] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
 
Consistent with our revenue recognition policy (see Note B[5] to  our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), we did not record revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 from certain licensees, including Cisco, who notified us they would not pay us ongoing royalties as a result of the HP Jury Verdict.  We disagree with the position taken by such licensees and may pursue arbitration if we do not achieve a satisfactory resolution (see Note J[1] and Note J[2] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
 
In addition to litigation involving our Remote Power Patent, we also have pending litigation involving our assertion of infringement claims concerning certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio (see "Legal Proceedings" at pages 27-30 of this Annual Report).

Our future success is largely dependent upon our ability to protect our intellectual property assets, including (i) our ability to overturn the District Court order of non-infringement in our trial with Hewlett-Packard which would obligate certain of our licensees including Cisco, our largest licensee, to pay us ongoing royalties and all royalties that accrued but were not paid following (and prior to) the HP Jury Verdict in November 2017 (see "Risk Factors" at page 16 hereof and "Legal Proceedings" at page 27 hereof), and (ii) monetization of our other patent portfolios including our Cox, Mirror Worlds and M2M/IoT patent portfolios as well as our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property.  The complexity of patent law and the inherent risk and uncertainty of litigation creates risks that our efforts to protect our intellectual property assets, or those of our strategic partners, may not be successful.  We may not be able to uphold our intellectual property assets, including that we may not be successful in overturning the District Court order of non-infringement in our trial with Hewlett-Packard involving our Remote Power Patent, or that third parties will not invalidate our other intellectual property assets. In addition, we may not be able to (i) acquire additional intellectual property assets or successfully license such assets or (ii) successfully enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property (see "Risk Factors" pages 16-26 of this Annual Report).
 
Remote Power Patent- Market Overview
 
Our Remote Power Patent (U.S. Patent No. 6,218,930) relates to several technologies which describe a methodology for controlling the delivery of power to certain devices over an Ethernet network.
 
The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is a non-profit, technical professional association of more than 420,000 members.  The Standards Association of the IEEE is responsible for the creation of global industry standards for a broad range of technology industries.  In 2000, at the urging of several industry vendors, the IEEE formed a task force to facilitate the adoption of a standardized methodology for the delivery of remote power over Ethernet networks which would ensure interoperability among vendors of switches and terminal devices. On June 13, 2003, the IEEE Standards Association approved the 802.3af Power over Ethernet standard (the "Standard"), which covers technologies deployed in delivering power over Ethernet networks. The Standard provides for the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) to be deployed in switches or as standalone midspan hubs to provide power to remote devices such as wireless access points, IP phones and network-based cameras. The technology is commonly referred to as Power over Ethernet ("PoE").   In 2009, the IEEE Standards Association approved 802.3at, a new PoE standard which, among other things, increased the available power for delivery over Ethernet networks.   We believe that our Remote Power Patent covers several of the key technologies covered by both the 802.3af and 802.3at standards.
 
Ethernet is the leading local area networking technology in use today.  PoE technology allows for the delivery of PoE cables rather than by separate power cords. As a result, a variety of network devices, including IP telephones, wireless LAN Access Points, web-based network security cameras, data collection terminals and other network devices, are able to receive power over existing data cables without the need to modify the existing infrastructure to facilitate the provision of power for such devices through traditional AC outlets.  Advantages such as lower installation costs, remote management capabilities, lower maintenance costs, centralized power backup, and flexibility of device location as well as the advent of worldwide power compatibility, led to PoE becoming widely adopted in networks throughout the world.

PoE provides numerous benefits including quantifiable returns on investment. The cost of hiring electricians to pull power cables to remote locations used for access points or security cameras can rival or exceed the cost of the devices.  Another key benefit is the need for Voice over IP power reliability in the face of power failures. Using PoE enables data center power supply systems to ensure ongoing power - a function that would be difficult and expensive to implement if each phone required AC outlets.
 
These and other advantages such as remote management capabilities, lower maintenance costs, and flexibility of device location have resulted in PoE technology being widely adopted in networks throughout the world.
 
Cox Patent Portfolio - Patents Related to Identification of Media Content on the Internet
 
On February 28, 2013, we acquired four patents (as well as a pending patent application) from Dr. Ingemar Cox pertaining to enabling technology for identifying media content on the Internet (the "Cox Patent Portfolio") for a purchase price of $1,000,000 in cash and 403,226 shares of our common stock. In addition, we are obligated to pay Dr. Cox 12.5% of the net proceeds generated by us from licensing, sale or enforcement of the Cox Patent Portfolio.   Dr. Cox provides consulting services to us with respect to the Cox Patent Portfolio and assists our efforts to develop the patent portfolio.
 
The Cox Patent Portfolio currently consisting of twenty-nine (29) patents, relates to enabling technology for identifying media content on the Internet, such as audio and video, and taking further actions to be performed based on such identification.  The patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio are based on a patent application filed in 2000 and have patent terms extending into 2023.  Since the acquisition of the Cox Patent Portfolio in February 2013, we have filed thirty-two (32) additional patent applications, twenty-four (24) of which have been issued and eight of which are pending relating to this portfolio. The claims in these twenty-four (24) additional issued patents are generally directed towards systems of content identification and performing actions following therefrom.
 
Dr. Cox is currently a Professor at the University of Copenhagen and University College London where he is head of its Media Futures Group.  Dr. Cox was formerly a member of the Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Labs and a Fellow at NEC Research Institute. He is a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE, the IET (formerly lEE), and the British Computer Society and is a member of the UK Computing Research Committee. He was founding co-editor in chief of the lEE Proc. on Information Security and was an associate editor of the IEEE Trans. on Information Forensics and Security. He is co-author of a book entitled "Digital Watermarking" and its second edition "Digital Watermarking and Steganography". He is an inventor of over fifty (50) U.S. Patents.

Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio - Patents Covering Document Stream Operating Systems
 
On May 21, 2013, Mirror Worlds Technologies, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired all of the patents previously owned by Mirror Worlds, LLC (which subsequently changed its name to Looking Glass LLC), consisting of nine issued United States patents and five pending applications (one of which was issued in November 2013) covering foundational technologies that enable unified search and indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system. As consideration for the acquisition of the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio, we paid Mirror Worlds, LLC $3,000,000 in cash and issued 5-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,750,000 shares of our common stock (875,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.40 per share and 875,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.10 per share).
 
In June 2014, we repurchased from Looking Glass LLC for $505,000 all of the aforementioned warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,750,000 shares of our common stock. In November 2013, we received a new patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,572,139) from the USPTO entitled "Desktop Streamed-Based, Information Management System". This new patent issuance related to one of the pending applications acquired as part of the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio in May 2013.
 
The inventions relating to document stream operating systems covered by the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio resulted from the work done by Yale University computer scientist, Professor David Gelernter, and his then graduate student, Dr. Eric Freeman, in the mid-1990s. Certain aspects of the technologies developed by David Gelernter were commercialized in their company's product offering called "Scopeware." Technologies embodied in Scopeware are now common in various computer and web-based operating systems. Professor Gelernter and Dr. Freeman each entered into consulting agreements with us as part of our acquisition of the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio.
 
As part of the acquisition of the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio, we also entered into an agreement with Recognition Interface, LLC ("Recognition"), an entity that financed the commercialization of the Mirror Worlds patent portfolio prior to its sale to Mirror Worlds, LLC and also retained an interest in the licensing proceeds of the Mirror Worlds patent portfolio. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with us, Recognition received from us an interest in the net proceeds realized from our monetization of the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio as follows: (i) 10% of the first $125 million of net proceeds; (ii) 15% of the next $125 million of net proceeds; and (iii) 20% of any portion of the net proceeds in excess of $250 million.  Since entering into the agreement with Recognition in May 2013, we have paid Recognition an aggregate of $3,127,000 with respect to such net proceeds interest in the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio (no such payments were paid for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017).  In addition to the net proceeds interest, we also issued to Recognition (and its affiliate) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from $1.40 to $2.10 per share.

M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio – Patents Related to Internet of Things and Machine-to-Machine Industries
 
On December 29, 2017, we acquired from M2M and IoT Technologies, LLC ("M2M") twelve (12) issued U.S. patents, seven pending U.S. patent applications and nine pending international patents, all relating to, among other things, the enabling technology for authenticating, provisioning and using embedded SIM cards in next generation IoT, Machine-to-Machine, and other mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets and computers as well as automobiles and drones (the "M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio").  We paid $1,000,000 to acquire the M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio and have an obligation to pay M2M 14% of the first $100 million of net proceeds (after deduction of expenses) and 5% of net proceeds greater than $100 million from Monetization Activities (as defined) related to our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio.  In addition, M2M will be entitled to receive from us $250,000 of additional consideration upon the occurrence of certain future events related to the patent portfolio.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we were issued six new U.S. patents for the M2M/IoT Portfolio.  The M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio currently consists of twenty (20) issued U.S. patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications and seven additional pending non-U.S. patent applications.  We anticipate further issuances of additional claims for this portfolio.
 
John Nix, the Managing Member of M2M, provides consulting services to us with respect to our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio. Mr. Nix is an entrepreneur and inventor, and founder and Chief Executive Officer of Vobal Technologies, LLC.  In 2016, Mr. Nix was recognized as "Creator of the Year" by the Intellectual Property Law Association of Chicago for his intellectual property related to embedded SIM technology.
 
Patent Acquisitions or Strategic Relationships
 
We continually seek to acquire additional intellectual property assets in order to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize such intellectual property.  We continually review opportunities to acquire or license additional intellectual property assets from individual inventors, technology companies and others for the purpose of pursuing licensing opportunities related to our existing intellectual property portfolio or otherwise.   In addition, we may enter into strategic relationships with such parties to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property. The form of such relationships may vary depending upon the opportunity and may include, among other things, a strategic investment in such third party, the provision of financing to such third party or the formation of a joint venture for the purpose of monetizing such third party's intellectual property assets.
Network-1 Strategy
 
Our strategy is to capitalize on our intellectual property assets by entering into licensing arrangements with third parties including manufacturers and users that utilize our intellectual property's proprietary technologies as well as any additional proprietary technologies covered by patents which may be acquired by us in the future. Our current patent acquisition and development strategy is to focus on 
 

 - 8 -
 

acquiring high quality patents which management believes have the potential to generate significant licensing opportunities as has been the case with our Remote Power Patent and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio.  Our Remote Power Patent has generated licensing revenue of approximately $144,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2018.  As a result of acquisition of our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio in May 2013, we have received licensing and other revenue of $47,150,000 through December 31, 2018.  In addition, we may enter into third party strategic relationships with inventors and patent owners to assist in the development and monetization of their patent technologies.  Based on our cash position, we continually review opportunities to acquire additional intellectual property as well as evaluate other strategic alternatives.
 
In connection with our activities relating to the protection of our intellectual property assets, or the intellectual property assets of third parties with whom we have strategic relationships in the future, it may be necessary to assert patent infringement claims against third parties whom we believe are infringing our patents or those of our strategic partners. We are currently involved in several litigations to protect our patents including our Remote Power Patent, certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio and our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio (see "Legal Proceedings" at pages 27-30 hereof). We have in the past successfully asserted litigation with respect to our Remote Power Patent and our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and have also been successful in defending proceedings at the USPTO challenging the validity of our Remote Power Patent and certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio (see "Legal Proceedings" at pages 27-30 of this Annual Report).
 
Licensing - Remote Power Patent
 
To date we have entered into twenty-seven (27) license agreements with respect to our Remote Power Patent.  Seventeen (17) of our twenty-seven (27) license agreements are royalty bearing (payable either on a quarterly or monthly basis) for the life of the Remote Power Patent (March 2020).

Cisco License Agreement
 
In July 2010, we settled our patent litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, against Adtran, Inc, Cisco Systems, Inc. and Cisco-Linksys, LLC, (collectively, "Cisco"), Enterasys Networks, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Foundry Networks, Inc., and 3Com Corporation, Inc.  As part of the settlement, Adtran, Cisco, Enterasys, Extreme Networks and Foundry Networks each entered into a settlement agreement with us and entered into non-exclusive licenses for our Remote Power Patent (the "Licensed Defendants").  Under the terms of the licenses, the Licensed Defendants paid us aggregate payments of approximately $32,000,000 upon settlement and also agreed to license our Remote Power Patent for its full term, which expires in March 2020. In accordance with our Settlement and License Agreement, dated May 25, 2011 (the "Agreement"), Cisco is obligated to pay us royalties (which began in the first quarter of 2011) based on its sales of PoE products up to maximum royalty payments per year of $9 million for the remaining term of the patent (March 2020). The actual royalty amounts received may be less than the cap stated above.  The royalty payments are subject to certain conditions including that there is no "Adverse Ruling" (as defined in the Agreement) involving our Remote Power Patent (see below — "The Impact of the Jury Verdict in our Hewlett-Packard Trial").  Under the terms of the Agreement, if we grant other licenses with lower royalty rates to third parties (as defined in the Agreement), Cisco shall be entitled to the benefit of the lower royalty rates provided it agrees to the material terms of such other license.  Under the terms of the Agreement, we have certain obligations to Cisco and if we materially breach such terms, Cisco will be entitled to stop paying royalties to us.
 
The Impact of the Jury Verdict in our Hewlett-Packard Trial
 
On November 13, 2017, the HP Jury Verdict was rendered which found that certain claims of our Remote Power Patent were invalid and not infringed by Hewlett-Packard.  On August 29, 2018, the District Court (i) granted our motion for judgment as a matter of law that our Remote Power Patent is valid, thereby overturning the HP Jury Verdict of invalidity and (ii) denied our motion for a new trial on infringement.  We have appealed the District Court's denial of our motion for a new trial on infringement to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see Note J[1] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).  Our seventeen (17) licensees with royalty bearing licenses are obligated to pay us ongoing royalties on a quarterly or monthly basis for the life of our Remote Power Patent (through March 2020), subject to certain conditions.  These conditions include the continued validity of certain claims of our Remote Power Patent or a finding that a third party's PoE products are found not to infringe our Remote Power Patent and such finding applies to our licensee's licensed products.  As a result of the HP Jury Verdict several of our largest licensees, including Cisco, our largest licensee, notified us in late November 2017 and January 2018 that they will no longer make ongoing royalty payments to 
 


 - 10 -
 

us pursuant to their license agreements.  If we successfully overturn the District Court judgment of non-infringement in our appeal to the Federal Circuit, certain licensees of the Remote Power Patent, including Cisco, will be obligated to pay us ongoing royalties and all royalties that accrued but were not paid following (and prior to) the HP Jury Verdict in November 2017.  If we are unable to reverse the District Court order of non-infringement on appeal, or there is an arbitration ruling that certain of our licensees, including Cisco, are relieved of their obligations to pay royalties and the District Court order of non-infringement is not subsequently reversed on appeal, our business, results of operations and cash-flow will continue to be materially adversely effected (see Note J[1] and Note J[2] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).
 
Consistent with our prior view, the District Court order overturning the HP Jury Verdict on invalidity as referenced above confirmed the obligations of certain licensees to pay us all prior unpaid royalties, including those that accrued after the date of the HP Jury Verdict (November 13, 2017), as well as future royalties through the expiration of the Remote Power Patent in March 2020 (see Note J[1] and Note J[2] hereof).  Notwithstanding the District Court decision overturning the HP Jury Verdict on validity, Dell refused to pay us all unpaid royalties and in November 2018 we instituted litigation against Dell to collect such unpaid royalties (see "Legal Proceedings" at page 28 hereof).
 
Licensing – Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio
 
We have entered into fully paid non-exclusive license agreements with respect to our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio with Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corporation pursuant to which we have received aggregate licensing revenue of $29,650,000 since the acquisition of the Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio in May 2013.
 
On July 8, 2016, Mirror Worlds Technologies, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a settlement agreement with Apple Inc. in connection with litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for infringement of one of our patents (U.S. Patent No. 6,006,227 (the "'227 Patent")) included within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Apple received a fully-paid non-exclusive license to our '227 Patent for its full term (which expired in June 2016), along with certain rights to other patents in our patent portfolio.  We received $25,000,000 from Apple for the settlement and the non-exclusive license.
 
On November 6, 2015, we entered into a settlement with Microsoft with respect to litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for infringement of our '227 Patent.  Under the terms of the settlement, Microsoft (including its customers) received a fully-paid non-exclusive license to our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio for the remaining life of its patents in consideration for a lump sum payment of $4,650,000 to us.
 
Significant Licensees
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, two licensees constituted an aggregate of 66% of our revenue including Juniper Networks, Inc. (57%) and Polycom, Inc. (9%).  Revenue from the sale of our unsecured claim against Avaya, Inc. constituted approximately 29% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, Cisco constituted 58% of our recurring revenue from royalty bearing license agreements and Dell, Inc. constituted 12% of such recurring revenue.  It is anticipated that one or a few of our licensees will continue to constitute a significant  portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.

Dovel & Luner, LLP provides legal services to us with respect to our pending patent litigation originally filed in September 2011 against sixteen (16) data networking equipment manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, relating to our Remote Power Patent (see Note H[1] to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).  We achieved settlements with fifteen (15) or the original sixteen (16) defendants.  The terms of our agreement with Dovel & Luner LLP essentially provide for legal fees on a full contingency basis ranging from 12.5% to 35% of the net recovery (after deduction for expenses) depending on the stage of the proceeding in which a result (settlement or judgment) is achieved.  We are responsible for a certain portion of the expenses incurred with respect to the litigation.

Competition
 
With respect to our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to monetize their intellectual property assets, we face considerable competition from other companies, many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have. The patent licensing and enforcement industry has grown over the past several years and there has been a material increase in the number of companies seeking to acquire intellectual property assets from third parties or to provide financing to third parties seeking to monetize their intellectual property. Entities including, among others, Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG), Intellectual Ventures, WI-LAN Inc., a subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc. (NASDAQ:QTRH), VirnetX Holdings Corp. (NYSE MKT:VHC), and RPX Corporation, seek to acquire intellectual property or partner with third parties to license or enforce intellectual property rights. In addition, we also compete with strategic corporate buyers with respect to the acquisition of intellectual property assets.  It is expected that others will enter this market as well. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than us.
 
We may also compete with litigation funding firms such as Burford Capital Limited, Validity Finance, LLC, Fortress Investment Group, LLC, Parabellum Capital LLC and Bentham Capital LLC, venture capital firms and hedge funds for intellectual property acquisitions and licensing opportunities.   Many of these competitors also have greater financial resources and human resources than us.
 
The industries and markets covered by our intellectual property are characterized by intense competition and rapidly changing business conditions, customer requirements and technologies. Other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to PoE (covered by our Remote Power Patent) or the technologies covered by our other intellectual property assets.  Such competing technologies may adversely impact our licensing revenue.   Moreover, technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors or adopted by various standards groups could render our Remote Power Patent and our other intellectual property assets obsolete, less marketable or unenforceable.
 
Regulatory Environment
 
If new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain legislation, regulations, and rulings by the courts and actions by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have materially increased the risk and cost of enforcement of patents.  U.S. patent laws were amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, referred to as the "America Invents Act", which became effective on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to

U.S. patent law. In general, it attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation and new administrative post-grant review procedures to challenge the patentability of issued patents outside of litigation, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Covered Business Method Review (CBM) proceedings which provide third parties a timely, cost effective alternative to district court litigation to challenge the validity of an issued patent. The America Invents Act and its implementation has increased the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In addition, future changes in patent law could adversely impact our business.  Such changes may not be advantageous to us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents.  Increased focus on the growing number of patent lawsuits, particularly by non-practicing entities (NPEs), may result in legislative changes which increase the risk and costs of asserting patent litigation.
 
Investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies
 
On December 18, 2018, we agreed to make an investment of up to $5,000,000 in ILiAD Biotechnologies, LLC ("ILiAD"), a privately held development stage biotechnology company dedicated to the prevention and treatment of human disease caused by Bordetella pertussis.  ILiAD is developing key technologies and working with leading scientists to investigate the impact of Bordetella pertussis in a range of human disease and is currently focused on validating its proprietary intranasal vaccine, BPZE1, in human clinical trials for the prevention of Pertussis (whooping cough).  Pertussis is a life-threatening disease caused by the highly contagious respiratory bacterium Bordetella pertussis. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year pertussis affects approximately 16 million people globally, accounting for nearly 200,000 deaths.
 
ILiAD's BPZE1 is an advanced next generation pertussis vaccine, designed to overcome deficiencies of current vaccines, including inadequate efficacy and duration of immunity, and failure to prevent nasal-passage based Bordetella pertussis infections that lead to transmission to vulnerable infants. Current vaccines have been found to be inadequate in curbing recent epidemics, highlighting the need for an improved vaccine against Bordetella pertussis.
 
In 2018, the FDA cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2a BPZE1 study, currently underway at the Vanderbilt Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which is being sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) at the National Institute of Health (NIH). BPZE1 has previously successfully demonstrated safety and immunological responses in Phase 1 trials at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. BPZE1 was developed in the lab of Camille Locht, PhD, at the Institut Pasteur de Lille (IPL) and French National Institute of Health and Medical research (Inserm) with whom ILiAD is working with and pursuant to which ILiAD holds exclusive global rights to BPZE1 and related B-Tech™ technologies that are covered by thirty-six (36) issued patents. An additional thirty-one (31) patents are pending around the world.

The investment by us is part of a financing of up to approximately $15,200,000 of Class C units of ILiAD, consisting of two tranches.  We made an initial investment of $2,500,000 to purchase 1,111,111 Class C units at $2.25 per unit and we also received five-year warrants to purchase 366,666 Class C units at an exercise price of $2.75 per unit.  In addition, we are obligated to invest an additional $2,500,000 to purchase 943,396 Class C units at $2.65 per unit (and will also receive additional five-year warrants to purchase 311,320 Class C units at an exercise price of $3.50 per unit) upon ILiAD receiving, on or before December 31, 2019, an "allowed-to-proceed" notification from the FDA for a Phase 2b clinical study.
 
In connection with our ILiAD investment, Corey Horowitz, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, became a member of the Board of Managers of ILiAD.  Following completion of the Class C financing (assuming completion of the second tranche), we will own approximately 10.7% of the outstanding membership units of ILiAD (on a non-fully diluted basis).
