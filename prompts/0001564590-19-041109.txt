 We have manufacturing facilities in Atibaia, Brazil, Newark, California and Penang, Malaysia. These manufacturing facilities have been ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 4500:2018 certified. We also have manufacturing and integration facilities in Fremont, California where assembly and test of our Penguin Computing products is done. Additionally, we are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance, or RBA, and our manufacturing facilities are compliant with the RBA Code of Conduct which is increasingly a business requirement of our customers.
 We believe that our manufacturing operations for specialty memory products for OEM customers have benefited from our many years of design experience and our existing library of proven designs which stress high manufacturability and quality. Over 30 years of manufacturing experience enables us to quickly move from manufacturing initiation to full production volumes of new products, which is paramount in helping our customers achieve rapid time-to-market for their new product introductions. As a result of our design efficiencies, high level of automation and expertise in utilizing advanced manufacturing processes, we achieve high manufacturing yields and reduced direct labor costs and offer our customers quick turnaround of both small and large production orders, which is a key factor in enabling our build-to-order model.
 While we do not own or operate wafer fabs, we have capabilities for subsequent stages of the product manufacturing cycle. Our manufacturing capabilities in Brazil consist of receiving unmounted integrated circuits, or ICs, in wafer form from third-party wafer fabs, preparing and packaging the ICs into semiconductor components, testing the components, and in some cases placing these components on substrates or printed circuit boards to make modules or multi-chip packages. Our advanced manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to become the largest local manufacturer, as measured by market share, of DRAM components and DRAM modules for the desktop, notebook and server markets in Brazil, as well as various Flash-based products, including eMCP and eMMC products for the mobile phone market. Through our investments and experience in Brazil, we have developed expertise in semiconductor technology and advanced manufacturing and test that allows us to manufacture products with shrinking geometries and increasing complexity. We have made significant capital investments to expand our manufacturing and test capabilities and operate at a high level of efficiency.
 In our SCSS products, we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order in each case using components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. At Penguin Computing, we have developed capabilities for design and development of large scale systems and dense HPC clusters that have significant power requirements with manufacturing and test for our HPC products being done in Fremont, California. 
 Product testing is an important aspect of our manufacturing operations and we believe that we have established substantial technical expertise in the testing of products for high-end applications. Our extensive testing capabilities not only help to ensure a low defect rate, but they also enable us, in certain situations, to sell specialized testing as an additional service. We design customer specific testing processes that differ from the core focus of standard providers. We have achieved stringent quality targets across a broad spectrum of system applications and customer-specific designs. Our staff includes experienced test engineers who have developed proprietary testing routines and parameters which, combined with our advanced test equipment, enable us to diagnose problems in components as well as in system design, and enable us to characterize the performance of new products and to provide high quality products in volume.

We employ extensive software-based electrical and thermal simulations and test our designs on high-end functional testers utilizing a broad set of test suites. These tests are designed to meet the quality requirements of enterprise class systems pursuant to stringent specifications required by various high speed and high compute applications. We also conduct design verification testing of hardware and firmware as well as system integration and reliability testing. We work to continually improve our test routines and associated software and for our specialty memory products, we have developed a high-volume, fully automated reliability testing and screening capability substantially beyond standard industry practices that enables us to reduce the occurrence of early life failures and weak module fallout which can save our customers from the often significant expenses associated with replacing products that fail after their field deployment.
 Customers
 We believe our customers rely on us as a strategic supplier due to our application-specific products, quality and technical support, our global footprint and, in Brazil, our ability to provide locally manufactured products. We also provide customized, integrated supply chain services to certain OEM customers to assist them in the management and execution of their procurement processes. We believe our close collaboration with customers, customer-specific designs, long-lifecycle solutions and proprietary supply chain services create significant customer attachment.
 We sell our products and solutions directly to a diversified base of local and global OEM, enterprise and government customers. Our specialty memory products are sold primarily to OEM customers in industrial, defense, networking and communications, enterprise storage and computing, as well as other vertical markets. In SCSS, we sell Penguin Computing products to enterprise and government customers in financial services, energy, defense, social media and education end markets and we sell SMART EC products to OEM customers in defense, telecommunications infrastructure, industrial, network edge computing and transportation markets., In SMART Wireless, we sell products to OEMs in IoT endpoint applications such as smart city, digital health, and smart office markets. In Brazil, we sell to OEM customers in computing and mobile products. 
 Overall, we served more than 750 end customers in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, sales to our ten largest end customers (including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of such end customers) accounted for 73%, 84% and 84% of net sales, respectively. Of our end customers, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, (for whom all sales are direct sales) accounted for 18%, 34% and 19% of net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively; Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, accounted for 11%, 12% and 15% of net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively; Lenovo Group Limited, or Lenovo, accounted for 13%, 11% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively; and Dell Technologies Inc., or Dell, accounted for 10% of net sales in fiscal 2018. Direct sales to Flex accounted for 17%, 13% and 14% of net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively; and direct sales to Hon Hai accounted for 13% of net sales in fiscal 2017. During these periods, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales.
 Our products are manufactured on a build-to-order basis. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to customer purchase orders and are not based on long-term supply agreements. Accordingly, we have limited backlog and we do not believe our backlog is material or indicative of anticipated net sales.

Our flexible and responsive global manufacturing capabilities, inventory management systems and global IT system allow us to cost-effectively move materials from one site to another and often deploy what might otherwise be excess inventory among other products and customers. We purchase almost all of our materials, including wafers used in our memory products in Brazil, from our suppliers on a purchase order basis and generally do not have long-term commitments from suppliers.
 Sales, Support and Marketing
 We primarily sell our products directly to global OEMs, enterprise, government and other end customers located across North America, Latin America, Asia and Europe. Our sales and marketing efforts are conducted through an integrated process incorporating our direct sales force, customer service representatives and our on-site field application engineers, or FAEs, with a network of independent sales representatives, distributors, integrators and resellers. Our sales and marketing efforts also include a high level of involvement from our senior executives. Larger customers are also often supported by dedicated sales and support teams. As of August 30, 2019, we had 134 sales and marketing personnel worldwide. 
 Our on-site FAEs work closely with our sales team to provide product design support to our customers. Our FAEs collaborate closely with our customers, providing us with insight into their business models and product roadmaps and allowing us to identify opportunities at an early stage to help grow our business. The combination of our integrated sales network with our FAEs enables us to be more responsive and successful in navigating through each customer’s unique and oftentimes complex design qualification or bid proposal processes. 
 Our marketing activities include advertising in technical journals, publishing articles in leading industry periodicals, social media, periodic webinars, publishing white papers and utilizing direct email solicitation.

Our advanced engineering and design capabilities allow us to address our customers’ increasingly complex needs. We design our products to be compatible with existing industry standards and, where appropriate, develop and promote new standards or provide custom solutions to meet customers’ requirements. An important aspect of our research and development effort is understanding the challenges presented by our customers’ requirements and addressing them by utilizing our industry knowledge, proprietary technologies and technical expertise. By working closely with our customers and suppliers, we are able to deliver technically advanced products designed to meet customer-specific needs with competitive solutions to satisfy our customers’ memory, storage and compute requirements, shorten their time-to-market and enhance the performance of our customers’ end products and applications.
 We spent $47.9 million, $39.8 million and $38.2 million on research and development in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of August 30, 2019, we had 282 research and development personnel worldwide.
 Competition
 In our specialty memory products and our Brazil products, we primarily compete against global and local memory module providers, and to a lesser extent, large semiconductor memory IC manufacturers that utilize a portion of their capacity to manufacture memory modules. In our Penguin Computing products we primarily compete with global manufacturers of HPC products and services. In SMART EC products, we primarily compete with makers of ruggedized computer boards and systems as well as makers of edge computing devices. In SMART Wireless products, we primarily compete with providers of SOMs and SBCs. The principal competitive factors in our markets include the ability to meet customer-specific requirements and provide high product quality, strong technical support, technologically advanced products and services, advanced testing capabilities, flexible and global delivery options, reliable supply and reasonable pricing. Our principal competitors include:

• | Providers of specialty memory products, including Viking Technology (a division of Sanmina Corporation), or Viking Technology, ATP Electronics, Inc., or ATP, Unigen Corporation, or Unigen, Apacer Technology, Inc., or Apacer, Swissbit AG, or Swissbit, Innodisk Corporation, or Innodisk, Virtium LLC, or Virtium, and Transcend Information, Inc., or Transcend;

In addition, some of our competitors are also our suppliers or customers. See “Item A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Sales to a limited number of customers represents a significant portion of our net sales, and the loss of any key customer or key program, or the demands of our key customers, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition” and “—Our dependence on a small number of sole or limited source suppliers subjects us to certain risks, including the risk that we may be unable to obtain adequate supplies at a reasonable price and in a timely manner.”
 In Brazil, other than the large, global semiconductor manufacturers, our competitors are generally much smaller in scale than we are in terms of revenue and capabilities for manufacturing and for research and development. To a lesser degree, we compete with companies that import DRAM and Flash components and products as well as battery products. 
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright and, to a lesser extent, patents to protect our intellectual property rights. As of October 18, 2019, we have 155 issued patents, including 115 patents issued in the United States, 36 patents issued in China, one patent issued in Brazil and 3 patents issued in South Korea, expiring between 2019 and 2037, excluding any additional patent term for patent term adjustments. In addition, we have 40 patent applications pending, including 19 patent applications in the United States, 7 patent applications in China, 7 patent applications in Brazil, 6 patent applications in Malaysia,  and 1 patent application in Argentina.  
 We also own a number of trademark registrations, including registrations in the United States for the word marks MHUB, SMART MODULAR TECHNOLOGIES and PENGUIN COMPUTING, and trademarks for our stylized “S” logo in combination with the word SMART and in combination with the words SMART MODULAR TECHNOLOGIES;  a trademark in the US and Canada for the graphic logo containing the words PENGUIN COMPUTING; in Brazil, registrations for our stylized “S” logo in combination with the words SMART Modular Technologies; and in Canada, a registration for the word mark PENGUIN COMPUTING. With the acquisition of AEC, we acquired the following registered trademarks: CENTELLIS in the U.S., China, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, Germany, Norway, Russia, EU, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Australia;  MAXCORE in Mexico, Germany, EU, India, Japan, Taiwan, Australia (and pending in U.S., Canada, Brazil, Norway, Russia, China, Hong Kong, Korea);  CONTROLSAFE (and logo) in Japan, Norway, Korea, U.S. (and pending in Canada and China);  FORCE in Norway, UK, WIPO, Austria, Benelux, Switzerland, Germany, EU, Spain, France, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Yugoslavia;  SRSSTACKWARE in U.S., China; RAPIDEX in Germany;  COMSTRUCT in UK;  SPIDERWARE in China. 
 While many of our products contain proprietary aspects, the majority of our products are built to meet industry standards, such as those set by JEDEC, the standards-setting organization for the semiconductor industry. The absence of patent protection for most of our products means that we cannot prevent our competitors from reverse-engineering and duplicating those products. Much of our intellectual property is know-how and trade secrets, and often we rely on the technological skills and innovation of our personnel rather than on patent protection. We believe that our continued success depends largely on our customer relationships, manufacturing and support capabilities and the technical expertise we have developed in manufacturing and designing products, and we rely on trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements to protect this aspect of our business.
 Employees
 As of August 30, 2019, we had 1,712 full-time employees.
 Our employee relations in Brazil are subject to Brazilian labor laws and regulations as well as collective bargaining arrangements that are negotiated every year. Five of these collective bargaining agreements are specific to our company while there are other collective bargaining agreements that are generally applicable to certain segments of the electronics industry. The applicable labor laws and regulations, as well as the collective bargaining agreements, principally relate to matters such as general working conditions, working time compensation, paid vacation and sick days and other mandatory benefits, length of the workday and payments for overtime, profit sharing and severance. Although a very small number of our employees in Brazil are members of a labor union, all employees in Brazil are represented by the unions for labor and employment matters.

We have never experienced a work stoppage in any of our locations worldwide, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
 Brazil Local Manufacturing Requirements
 The Brazilian government has a long history of utilizing local manufacturing requirements to promote job creation, sustain economic growth and increase the competitiveness of various domestic industries. These regulations have also helped enable the expansion of the Brazilian middle class. These requirements have been important in the development of numerous industries in Brazil, including automotive, oil and gas, aerospace and healthcare. Beginning in 1991, local manufacturing regulation was introduced to vitalize Brazil’s IT industry as government programs began to be implemented to incentivize manufacturers to establish and expand their operations in Brazil and to incentivize OEMs to apply and utilize locally manufactured components for their products.
 We have participated in three government investment incentive programs.
  
• | Lei da Informática—Processo Produtivo Básico, 1991, extended through 2029, or PPB/IT Program: Provides for significant relief from various tax provisions for companies that develop or produce computing and automation goods and invest in IT-related research and development in Brazil. The PPB/IT Program requirements for local manufacturing are published publicly on a periodic basis. OEMs that are PPB/IT Program-compliant and who fulfill the regulatory requirements receive substantial benefits including a reduction in excise taxes on their purchases from qualified suppliers as well as a reduction in the taxes that they are required to charge on sales to their end customers. These tax benefits are a strong incentive for OEMs to purchase products from local manufacturers such as our Brazilian subsidiaries. The PPB/IT Program requirements for locally sourced memory components from calendar years 2008 through June 30, 2019 were enacted through several ordinances portions of which are set forth below.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lei do Bem, 2005: Fosters technology innovation in Brazil by providing a reduction in corporate income tax through the allowance of deductions for expenses related to research and development activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PADIS, 2007: Awards incentives and significant tax relief, including reductions in the Brazilian aggregate statutory income tax rates, to semiconductor and display companies that invest in research and development and that promote the development, design, test and packaging processes in Brazil. Furthermore, combining PADIS with PPB/IT Program-compliance can provide additional financial incentives to OEMs that apply or utilize memory components that are locally processed from wafers.

As the leading local manufacturer, as measured by market share, of desktop, notebook and server DRAM modules and DRAM components as well as DRAM and Flash mobile memory products in Brazil, we have benefited from these requirements and incentives. 
 In 2013, the European Union, or EU, later joined by Japan, requested the establishment of a panel within the World Trade Organization, or WTO, to determine whether the structure of certain programs enacted by the Brazilian government concerning incentives and local content requirements for the automotive and several other industries (including the IT industry and including portions of Lei do Bem that do not relate to our business, as well as PADIS and the PPB/IT Program), were inconsistent with WTO rules. On August 30, 2017 the WTO panel released a report and on December 13, 2018, after hearing appeals, the appellate body of the WTO released its decision in which it upheld some of the panel’s findings that certain of the incentives available to us in Brazil are contrary to certain of the principles of the WTO agreements while also rejecting some of the complaints by the EU and Japan. The WTO’s decision does not impact the benefits that we receive under Lei do Bem. The appellate body also noted that it would not contravene the principles of the WTO agreements for Brazil to establish local manufacturing processes as a condition to benefit from incentives granted by the government provided that certain conditions are met.
 In response to the WTO report, government authorities in Brazil revoked several ordinances that established local content requirements under the PPB/IT Program, many of which were related to our local business. The revocation became effective June 30, 2019. Government officials in Brazil have continued to express their intent to restructure the incentives to be consistent with the WTO principles while still continuing to support local industry. 
 In June 2019, the authorities in Brazil published the first of a series of new ordinances, effective as of July 1, 2019, that provide a structure for revised support for local manufacturing utilizing a score-based point system for eligibility for incentives. In this system, each manufacturing process within an electronic device is assigned a different number of points. Our manufacturing processes related to memory products are a valuable part of the electronics manufacturing chain and, as such, are expected to provide our customers the opportunity to accomplish a significant number of the overall points required if they purchase products manufactured by us in Brazil.
 While we believe that this score-based system will continue to incentivize our Brazilian customers to purchase products from us in Brazil, there can be no assurance that the replacement programs will ultimately be structured and implemented in a way that will provide the same or a similar level of support and benefit for our customers and our business as was previously in place. There can also be no assurance that the WTO, the EU and Japan will agree that this new program structure is compliant with the WTO agreements. Any adverse change in legislation or in the impact and effectiveness of the local incentives programs, or our failure to meet the requirements of any of the regulations, could significantly reduce the demand for, the profit margins on, and the competitiveness of our products in Brazil, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Item A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Risks Related to our International Operations— Our success in Brazil depends in part on Brazilian laws establishing incentives for local manufacturing of electronics products. The elimination of or a reduction in the incentives for local manufacturing, or our inability to secure the benefits of these regulations, could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil.”
 Environmental Regulations
 Our operations and properties are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, reverse logistics (take-back policy) and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. The presence of lead in quantities not believed to be significant have been found in the ground under one of the multi-tenant buildings we lease in Brazil. While we did not cause the contamination, we may be held responsible if remediation is required, although we may be entitled to seek indemnification from responsible parties under Brazilian law and from our lessor under our lease. We cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory agencies, enactment of more stringent laws and regulations or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and cause additional material liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
