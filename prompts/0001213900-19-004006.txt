Item 1. Business.
GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
 
Bioxytran, Inc. (“we”, “us”, or the “Company”) is an early stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of therapeutic drugs designed to address hypoxia in humans, which is a lack of oxygen to tissues. If it is not addressed, lack of oxygen to tissues, or hypoxia, results in necrosis, which is the death of cells comprising body tissue. Necrosis cannot be reversed. Our lead drug candidate, code named BXT-25, is an oxygen-carrying small molecule consisting of bovine hemoglobin stabilized with a co-polymer with intended applications to include treatment of hypoxic conditions in the brain resulting from stroke Our initial focus is the treatment of hypoxic conditions in the brain resulting from stroke. Our drug development efforts are guided by specialists on co-polymer chemistry and other disciplines, and we intend to supplement our efforts with input from a scientific and medical advisory board whose members are leading physicians.
Company Overview
 
We are an early stage pharmaceutical company founded on October 5, 2017 to focus on the development, manufacture and commercialization of therapeutic drugs designed to address hypoxia in humans, which is a lack of oxygen to tissues. Our initial focus is the treatment of hypoxic conditions in the brain resulting from stroke.
 
Currently, our lead pharmaceutical drug candidate is code named BXT-25 and is planned to be an oxygen-carrying small molecule consisting of bovine hemoglobin stabilized with a co-polymer. This modified hemoglobin will be designed to be an injectable intravenous drug and we plan to begin pre-clinical studies and apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval to use BXT-25 to prevent necrosis, or cell death, by carrying oxygen to human tissue when blood flow to the brain. If we successfully complete Phase I testing with the FDA we plan to explore the use of additional drug candidates using chemical structures that are a sub-class of BXT-25 that share the same physical properties to treat wound healing due to hypoxia, cardiovascular ischemia, anemia, cancer conditions and trauma, subject to FDA approval. However, we will need to raise additional funds in excess of the $10,000,000 in our currently effective public offering in order to expand the use of BXT-25 to new indications,
 
Both BXT-25 is a novel unproven technology. Although we have not conducted research applying our co-polymer technology and related chemistry to the treatment of hypoxic conditions, we know from Dr. Platt’s prior research that our technology enables the creation of molecules that are 5,000 times smaller than human red blood cells and we believe that our proprietary technology will enable these molecules to carry oxygen for delivery to tissue through the bloodstream. We also believe that the small size of these molecules will more effectively enable their delivery to hypoxic tissues which red blood cells cannot reach under the clinical conditions we intend to address. We may be unsuccessful in developing these technologies into drugs which the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ultimately will approve.
 
Stroke 
 
Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or brain attack, occurs when poor flow to the brain results in necrosis and cell death. Strokes can be classified into two major categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes are caused by interruption of the blood supply to the brain; hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. According to the Center for Disease Control, approximately 87% of all strokes are ischemic strokes. An ischemic stroke may be thrombotic, which occurs when diseased or damaged cerebral arteries become blocked by the formation of a blood clot within the brain, or embolic, which occurs when a clot formed originally somewhere in the body outside the brain - typically in the heart - travels in a cerebral artery. Whether thrombotic or embolic, an ischemic stroke restricts the flow of blood to the brain and results in near-immediate physical and neurological deficits.
 
According to the Center for Disease Control, there are about 795,000 new or recurrent cases of stroke in the United States each year, of which 610,000 are new cases and 185,000 recurrent cases. One hundred thirty thousand (130,000) Americans are killed by stroke each year, or one very four minutes. Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability and costs the United States an estimated $34 Billion each year, according to the Center for Disease Control, a figure which includes the cost of health care services, medications to treat the stroke, and missed days of work.

Hemoglobin and Complex Co-Polymer Science
 
Oxygen therapeutics describe generally a class of agents that will be administered intravenously to enhance the oxygen delivery capability of blood. These oxygen transporting agents may be perfluorcarbon (PFC) emulsions or modified hemoglobin solutions. Our technology involves the development of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. To produce BXT-25, we will take red blood cells (RBCs) from bovine sources, isolate hemoglobin from the RBCs and, by applying our proprietary co-polymer chemistry, stabilize and modify the hemoglobin. Our novel, complex co-polymer molecules can be produced at specific molecular weights and with other pharmaceutical properties; and in the production of BXT-25.
 
The BXT-25 co-polymer hemoglobin molecule will be designed to be 5,000 times smaller than an RBC, which we believe will enable that small molecule to reach hypoxic tissue more effectively than RBCs. BXT-25 will be designed to be administered as an injectable IV drug that will circulate in the blood collecting oxygen from the lungs and releasing the oxygen molecules where tissue has developed ischemia, or lack of oxygen. BXT-25 will be designed to have oxygen affinity that mimics RBCs, minimize adverse effects, and be compatible with all blood types. BXT will be designed to have a shelf life of two years at room temperature.
 
With regard to compatibility with all blood types, we believe that the differences between a BXT-25 molecule and a red blood cell will not limited to differences in size. Surfaces of red blood cells include different antigens which determine the blood type as A, B, AB or O. We believe that BXT-25 will be found to be compatible with all blood types because it is a single, modified hemoglobin molecule stabilized with a co-polymer which, unlike a red blood cell, has neither antigens nor a Rh factor.
 
Certain regulatory issues relating to our use of bovine hemoglobin as a raw material
 
Our products include as a raw material commercially available bovine hemoglobin that has been purified, chemically modified and cross-linked for stability. It is sourced from controlled herds of U.S. cattle raised for beef production. Those herds are subject to and meet the requirements of a herd management program that assures the origin, health, feed and quality of the cattle used as a raw material source. Our suppliers will contract to maintain traceable records on animal origin, health, feed and care as part of our effort to assure the use of known, healthy animals in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 
Bovine whole blood will be collected in individual pre-sanitized containers. The containers will be shipped to separation facility. Prior to collection of the blood, the animals undergo live inspection. Then, following blood collection, the animal carcass undergoes U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspection for use as beef for human consumption. If an animal carcass is retained for further inspection for final disposition by the USDA veterinarian, we reject the corresponding container of whole blood. We have validated and tested the processes described below for removal of potential pathogens in our raw material. Potential pathogens include bacteria, viruses such as those leading to hepatitis and AIDS, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies that cause rare neurological disorders such as “mad cow disease” and its human equivalent. The validation of a process means that it has been tested and documented and that it performs adequately. Health and regulatory authorities have given guidance directed at three factors to control these diseases: source of animals, the nature of tissue used and manufacturing process. We will comply with, and believe we will exceed, all current guidelines regarding such risks for human pharmaceutical products.
 
There will be four major steps in the manufacture of BXT-25: (1) hemoglobin separation; (2) hemoglobin purification; (3) polymerization/size selection and (4) synthesizing with our co-polymer. More specifically, bovine blood that has been collected in an aseptic fashion is processed to first remove plasma and then to remove at high concentration the hemoglobin protein from red blood cells. The hemoglobin is then purified of other red cell proteins by anion exchange chromatography. The purified hemoglobin is then stabilized by the addition of a cross-linking agent to form hemoglobin polymers. There is an additional sizing step to remove the higher hemoglobin molecules. The final step, co-polymer synthesis, takes place on the stabilized hemoglobin. The combination polymers will be filled with a solution suitable for infusion. The product is then run through sterilizing filters into sterile product bags.

Business Developments
 
We will develop and, through third party contracts, manufacture oxygen therapeutics. Our oxygen therapeutics are a new class of pharmaceuticals that are administered intravenously to transport oxygen to the body’s tissues. Currently there are four drugs candidates to treat a stroke. Abciximab from Eli Lilly is a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Clinical trials show little advantage over placebos and could lead to dangerous side effects, including more bleeding in patients. Cerovive from AstraZeneca is a Nitrone-based neuro protectant currently in phase III clinical trials which shows no significant benefit over placebos with respect to changes in neurological impairment as measured by the national institute of health stroke scale. Candesartan, from AstraZeneca, is an angiotensin receptor blocker which was used to control blood pressure. Its efficacy in stroke patients still must be proven. Ancod from Knoll Pharmaceuticals is an anti-coagulant that acts by breaking down the fibrinogen. It increases the risk of hemorrhage similar to those associated with tPA.
 
Using our issued patents and proprietary technology, we will develop and manufacture BXT-25 and similar drugs for applications including treatment of stroke conditions. Our patent position consists of 3 parts: a patent relating to our co-polymer technology issued in 2009 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office expiring in February 2029 (method patent for producing modified pectins consisting of neutral sugar sequences ) and assigned to us outright by David Platt; various methods to stabilize a single hemoglobin molecule that are in the public domain; and proprietary technology that is the subject were issued in 2001 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office expiring in June 2021 (Enhancement of Delivery of Radio imaging and Radioprotective Agents). Dr. Platt did not receive any compensation from the Company in consideration of his assignment of the two patents.


The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these laws and regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time-consuming. Our goal, to advance our leading drug candidate, BXT-25, through regulatory submissions for Investigational New Drug (IND) status in the United States, is subject to expensive and time-consuming approval processes.
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products, including biologics like BXT-25, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA/EMA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA/EMA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA/EMA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years (typically between 5-7 years post an IND submission) and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practices, or GCP, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support New Drug Applications (NDAs) are typically conducted in three sequential Phases, but the Phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the investigational drug candidate into healthy human subjects or patients, the investigational drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers.
 
If an investigational drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide adequate information for its labeling.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA, is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the marketing application is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The marketing application must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of marketing applications. Most such applications for non-priority drug products are reviewed within ten months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 
Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the marketing application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the product is safe and effective in the indication studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with FDA’s general biological product standards.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed in a resubmission of the marketing application, the FDA will re-initiate review. If the FDA is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the agency will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. It is not unusual for the FDA to issue a complete response letter because it believes that the drug product is not safe enough or effective enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of approval of the marketing application, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug product’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Once a NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of therapeutic products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.

BXT-25
 
Currently, our lead pharmaceutical drug candidate is code named BXT-25 and is planned to be an oxygen-carrying small molecule consisting of bovine hemoglobin stabilized with a co-polymer. This modified hemoglobin will be designed to be an injectable intravenous drug and we plan to begin pre-clinical studies and apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval to use BXT-25 to prevent necrosis, or cell death, by carrying oxygen to human tissue when blood flow to the brain.
 
The only FDA approved treatment for ischemic strokes is tissue plasminogen activator tPA, also known as IV rtPA, given through an IV in the arm. tPA works by dissolving the clot and improving blood flow to the part of the brain being deprived of blood flow. If administered within 3 hours and up to 4.5 hours in certain eligible patients, tPA may improve the chances of recovering from a stroke. Another treatment option is an endovascular procedure called mechanical thrombectomy in which a blood clot is removed by threading a wired-caged device called a stent retriever through an artery in the groin up to the blocked artery in the brain. The stent opens and grabs the clot, enabling the removal of the stent with the trapped clot.
 
Hypoxia is a condition in which cells lack sufficient oxygen supply to support metabolic function. The BXT-25 co-polymer hemoglobin molecule will be designed to contain an oxygen rechargeable iron which picks up oxygen in the lungs, is expected to be 5,000 times smaller than an RBC, and we believe can reach hypoxic tissue more effectively than RBCs. Products similar to BXT-25 are stable at room temperature and have no blood type matching requirement. We plan to introduce BXT-25 in clinical trials for hypoxic medical conditions as stroke.
 
For the production of BXT-25, we intend to utilize third party manufacturing facilities that we believe are fully compliant with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) only, as required by the regulatory authorities in Europe or the United States, in order to produce a sufficient quantity of BXT-25 for animal toxicity and pre-clinical trials for animals. We have not conducted any clinical trials on animals or humans to confirm the efficacy of or filed any applications with the FDA with respect to BXT-25. We are in the process of developing BXT-25 for pre-clinical studies for human use, in order to conduct clinical trials and to file applications with the FDA as applicable. We expect to file an IND application with the FDA in 2020, provided we obtain adequate funding.
 
This product is being developed and as an early intervention in an out-of-hospital setting for the treatment of patients with ischemia of the brain resulting from a stroke or the blockage of the blood vessels to the brain. We plan to initially conduct pre-clinical trials and to seek approval of BXT-25 for the treatment of adults at early stages of stroke.
 
We will design BXT-25 to transport oxygen through blocked arteries to oxygen-deprived tissues. We expect that the BXT-25 molecule at room temperature solution will be 5,000 times smaller than a red blood cell and its size will enable its delivery to oxygenate brain tissue where red blood cells will not go due to strokes If we are successful with our Phase I testing for BXT-25 with the FDA, we plan to apply to the FDA for other indications including wound healing due to hypoxia, cardiovascular ischemia anemia, cancer conditions and trauma. However, we will need to raise additional funds in excess of the $10,000,000 in our currently effective public offering in order to expand the use of BXT-25 to new indications,
 
European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines Certification (EDQM)
 
Certification from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) is required for all new and approved human and veterinary medicinal products that are manufactured from materials taken from cattle and marketed in the European Union. As part of the certification process, we will be required to provide technical information on the manufacturing process, the origin of the raw material and type of tissue used, the cattle traceability, beginning at their country of birth, and auditing, and a risk analysis from an independent expert.
 
We intend to establish and implement clinical development programs that add value to our business in the shortest period of time possible and to seek strategic partners when a program becomes advanced and requires additional resources. We intend to continue focusing our expertise and resources to develop novel formulations, and to leverage development partnerships to apply our complex co-polymer chemistry designs in other medical indications. We may seek to enter into licensing, co-marketing, or co-development agreements across different geographic regions, in order to avail ourselves of the marketing expertise of one or more seasoned marketing and/or pharmaceutical companies. We plan to further develop new and proprietary drug candidates by using novel development pathways specific to each drug candidate.

A core part of our strategy relies upon creating safe and efficacious drug formulations that can be administered as standalone therapies or in combination with existing medications. We believe we utilize a novel approach that is expected to create drug formulations that can be combined with existing therapies and potentially deliver valuable products in areas of high unmet medical needs. We will assemble a scientific advisory board consisting of scientists with both academic and corporate research and development experience that will provide leadership and counsel in the scientific, technological and regulatory aspects of our current and future projects. In addition, we will assemble a medical advisory board consisting of leading physicians and key opinion leaders who have participated in relevant clinical studies and who will guide us through ongoing clinical trial programs. Our scientific and medical advisory boards consist of some of leading scientists, medical doctors and professionals in the co-polymer and ischemic brain injury field.
 
We believe that our drug development leadership team provides us with a significant competitive advantage in designing highly efficient clinical programs to deliver valuable products in areas of high unmet medical needs.
 
If the Company is successful in raising $10,000,000 in our currently effective public offering, approximately $3.15 million of proceeds will be used for preparation for scale up and manufacturing (Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), approximately $1.5 million will be used for toxicity testing in animals for Investigational New Drug application (IND), approximately $3.5 million for Phase I (safety) and Phase II (proof of concept) clinical trials. We expect that obtaining a CE from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines will require an additional $500,000 in funds.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Stroke
 
Our injectable drug candidate, BXT-25, will potentially compete with existing therapies for the treatment for stroke, hypoxia and anti-necrosis that according to Global Industry Analysts, Inc. has a global market opportunity of $50 billion. Hypoxia is a condition in which cells lack sufficient oxygen supply to support metabolic function. The standard therapy for acute anemia resulting from blood loss is infusion of red blood cells mainly from supplies of donated blood. For prophylactic or long-term treatment of anticipated or chronic anemia, medications that stimulate the creation of new red blood cells are frequently used.
 
According to the Center for Disease Control, there are about 795,000 new or recurrent cases of stroke in the United States each year, of which 610,000 are new cases and 185,000 recurrent cases. One hundred thirty thousand (130,000) Americans are killed by stroke each year, or one very four minutes. Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability and costs the United States an estimated $34 Billion each year, according to the Center for Disease Control, a figure which includes the cost of health care services, medications to treat the stroke, and missed days of work.
 
Presently, the standard therapy for reversing hypoxia is blood infusion, RBCs or hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric medicine or hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a medical term for using oxygen at a level higher than atmospheric pressure. The HBOT treatment can only be done at a medical facility and each session can cost from $1,000 to more than $3,000. For decades, oxygen carriers have been developed for perfusion and oxygenation of ischemic tissue; none have yet succeeded in becoming a proven oxygen therapeutics for stroke and would healing. These products were either blood-derived elements, synthetic perfluorocarbons, or red blood cell modifiers. According to the Fact Sheet No. 279 published June 7, 2014 by the World Health Organization, there is a global shortage of transfusion suitable blood of 110 million units, and the need for blood is rising 6-7% annually. We will design BXT-25 and any new drug candidates to enhance HBOT treatment and reduce the demand on blood transfusions, subject to testing as required by the FDA.
 
Key Strengths
 
We believe that our key differentiating elements include:
 
Focus on novel therapeutic opportunities provided by co-polymer: We are focused on development of co-polymer compounds to stabilize the modified hemoglobin molecule. The Co-polymer method of chemical stabilization has not received as much scientific attention as nucleic acids and proteins, but the Company believes that it is a viable alternative to these other materials.
