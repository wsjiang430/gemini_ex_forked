ITEM 1.     BUSINESS.
Overview
Piper Jaffray Companies ("Piper Jaffray") is an investment bank and asset management firm, serving the needs of corporations, private equity groups, public entities, non-profit entities and institutional investors in the U.S. and internationally. Founded in 1895, Piper Jaffray provides a broad set of products and services, including financial advisory services; equity and debt capital markets products; public finance services; equity research and institutional brokerage; fixed income institutional brokerage; and asset management services. Our headquarters are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and we have offices across the United States and international locations in London, Aberdeen and Hong Kong. We market our investment banking and institutional securities business under Piper Jaffray and Simmons Energy – A Division of Piper Jaffray. Our traditional asset management business is marketed under Advisory Research, Inc.
Our Businesses
We operate through two reportable business segments, Capital Markets and Asset Management. We believe that the mix of activities across our business segments helps to provide diversification in our business model.
Capital Markets
The Capital Markets segment provides investment banking and institutional sales, trading and research services for various equity and fixed income products. This segment also includes the results from our alternative asset management funds and our principal investments. 

• | Investment Banking – For our corporate clients, we provide advisory services, primarily relating to mergers and acquisitions, equity private placements, and debt and restructuring advisory. We also help raise capital through equity and debt financings. We operate in the following focus sectors: healthcare; energy; consumer; diversified industrials and services; business services; technology; financial services; and agriculture, clean technologies and renewables, primarily focusing on middle-market clients. For our government and non-profit clients, we underwrite debt issuances, provide municipal financial advisory and loan placement services, and offer various over-the-counter derivative products. Our public finance investment banking capabilities focus on state and local governments, cultural and social service non-profit entities, and the education, healthcare, hospitality, senior living and transportation sectors.

• | Equity and Fixed Income Institutional Brokerage – We offer both equity and fixed income advisory and trade execution services for institutional investors and government and non-profit entities. Integral to our capital markets efforts, we have equity sales and trading relationships with institutional investors in North America and Europe that invest in our core sectors. Our research analysts provide investment ideas and support to our trading clients on approximately 650 companies. Our fixed income sales and trading professionals have expertise in municipal, corporate, mortgage, agency, treasury and structured product securities and cover a range of institutional investors. We principally engage in trading activities to facilitate customer needs. Our strategic trading activities (i.e., proprietary trading) are dedicated solely to investing firm capital, and focus principally on proprietary investments in municipal bonds and U.S. government agency securities.


• | Principal Investments – We engage in merchant banking activities, which involve equity investments in late stage private companies. Additionally, we have investments in private equity funds and other firm investments.


• | Alternative Asset Management Funds – We have created alternative asset management funds in merchant banking, energy, and senior living in order to invest firm capital and to manage capital from outside investors.

Asset Management
The Asset Management segment includes our traditional asset management business and our investments in registered funds and private funds or partnerships that we manage. Our traditional asset management business offers specialized investment management solutions for institutions, private clients and investment advisors. We manage MLP and energy infrastructure strategies, as well as domestic and global equity strategies. We offer customized solutions to our clients in both diversified and more concentrated versions of our products, generally through separately managed accounts, and open-end and closed-end funds. 

• | Master Limited Partnerships ("MLPs") and Energy Infrastructure – We manage MLPs, energy infrastructure, and related operating entity assets focused on the energy sector. These strategies focus on growth, yet seek to limit exposure to riskier securities by placing greater importance on characteristics which support stable distributions and are representative of higher quality MLPs, including less volatile businesses, strategic assets, cleaner balance sheets and proven management teams. In addition to our MLP-focused funds, we manage other private funds focused on energy sector securities.


• | Equity – Our equity product offerings include both value and growth-driven strategies in the domestic and global equity markets. These strategies have investment philosophies built on a foundation of core principles, which have been tested in various market conditions and remained consistent over time. Our investment strategies seek to create portfolios that deliver long-term, positive returns while minimizing risk.

As of December 31, 2018, total assets under management ("AUM") were $5.8 billion, of which approximately 53 percent was invested in MLPs and energy infrastructure securities and 47 percent in equities. As of the same date, approximately 79 percent of our AUM was invested in domestic investment strategies and 21 percent was invested in global investment strategies. Approximately 50 percent of our AUM as of December 31, 2018 was managed on behalf of institutional clients, including pension funds, corporations, foundations and endowments, and through mutual fund sponsors and registered advisors. Approximately 31 percent of our AUM was managed through sub-advisory relationships on closed-end funds, and approximately 19 percent of our AUM was managed on behalf of individual client relationships, which are principally high net worth individuals.
Financial Information about Geographic Areas
As of December 31, 2018, the substantial majority of our net revenues and long-lived assets were located in the U.S.

Competition
Our business is subject to intense competition driven by large Wall Street and international firms operating independently or as part of a large commercial banking institution. We also compete with regional broker dealers, boutique and niche-specialty firms, asset management firms and alternative trading systems that effect securities transactions through various electronic venues. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, quality of advice and service, reputation, product selection, transaction execution, financial resources and investment performance. Many of our large competitors have greater financial resources than we have and may have more flexibility to offer a broader set of products and services than we can.
In addition, there is significant competition within the securities industry for obtaining and retaining the services of qualified employees. Our business is a human capital business and the performance of our business is dependent upon the skills, expertise and performance of our employees. Therefore, our ability to compete effectively is dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified individuals who are motivated to serve the best interests of our clients, thereby serving the best interests of our company. Attracting and retaining employees depends, among other things, on our company's culture, management, work environment, geographic locations and compensation.
Employees
As of February 20, 2019, we had approximately 1,262 employees, of whom approximately 762 were registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA").
Regulation
As a participant in the financial services industry, our business is regulated by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations ("SROs") and securities exchanges, and by foreign governmental agencies, financial regulatory bodies and securities exchanges. We are subject to complex and extensive regulation of most aspects of our business, including the manner in which securities transactions are effected, net capital requirements, recordkeeping and reporting procedures, relationships and conflicts with customers, the handling of cash and margin accounts, conduct, experience and training requirements for certain employees, and the manner in which we prevent and detect money-laundering and bribery activities. The regulatory framework of the financial services industry is designed primarily to safeguard the integrity of the capital markets and to protect customers, not creditors or shareholders. 
The laws, rules and regulations comprising this regulatory framework can (and do) change frequently, as can the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations. Conditions in the global financial markets and economy, including the 2008 financial crisis, caused legislators and regulators to increase the examination, enforcement and rule-making activity directed toward the financial services industry. The intensity of the regulatory environment may correlate with the level and nature of our legal proceedings for a given period, and increased intensity could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our U.S. broker dealer subsidiary (Piper Jaffray & Co.) is registered as a securities broker dealer with the SEC and is a member of various SROs and securities exchanges. In July 2007, the National Association of Securities Dealers and the member regulation, enforcement and arbitration functions of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") consolidated to form FINRA, which now serves as the primary SRO of Piper Jaffray & Co., although the NYSE continues to have oversight over NYSE-related market activities. FINRA regulates many aspects of our U.S. broker dealer business, including registration, education and conduct of our broker dealer employees, examinations, rulemaking, enforcement of these rules and the federal securities laws, trade reporting and the administration of dispute resolution between investors and registered firms. We have agreed to abide by the rules of FINRA (as well as those of the NYSE and other SROs), and FINRA has the power to expel, fine and otherwise discipline Piper Jaffray & Co. and its officers, directors and employees. Among the rules that apply to Piper Jaffray & Co. are the uniform net capital rule of the SEC (Rule 15c3-1) and the net capital rule of FINRA. Both rules set a minimum level of net capital a broker dealer must maintain and also require that a portion of the broker dealer's assets be relatively liquid. Under the applicable FINRA rule, FINRA may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below FINRA requirements. In addition, Piper Jaffray & Co. is subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital. As a result of these rules, our ability to make withdrawals of capital from Piper Jaffray & Co. may be limited. In addition, Piper Jaffray & Co. is licensed as a broker dealer in each of the 50 states, requiring us to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations of each state. Any state may revoke a license to conduct a securities business and fine or otherwise discipline broker dealers and their officers, directors and employees.

We also operate one entity that is authorized, licensed and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and registered under the laws of England and Wales, as well as an entity that is authorized, licensed and regulated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and registered under the laws of Hong Kong. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission regulate these entities (in their respective jurisdictions) in areas of capital adequacy, customer protection and business conduct, among others. We also have a subsidiary organized in Guernsey and regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission ("GFSC").
Entities in the jurisdictions identified above are also subject to anti-money laundering regulations. Piper Jaffray & Co. is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations requiring us to implement standards for verifying client identification at the time the client relationship is initiated, monitoring client transactions and reporting suspicious activity. Our entities in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and Guernsey are subject to similar anti-money laundering laws and regulations. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as other anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. 
We maintain subsidiaries that are registered as investment advisors with the SEC and subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. Advisory Research, Inc. ("ARI"), Piper Jaffray Investment Management LLC ("PJIM"), and PJC Capital Partners LLC are asset management subsidiaries and registered investment advisors. As registered investment advisors, these entities are subject to requirements that relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between advisor and advisory clients, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. Piper Jaffray & Co. is also a registered investment advisor and subject to these requirements. Also, certain investment funds that we manage are registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). Those funds and entities that serve as the funds' investment advisors are subject to the Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC, which regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment advisor and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions or joint transactions, among other requirements. ARI is also authorized by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority as an investment advisor in Ireland and cleared by the Luxembourg Commission de Surviellance du Secteur Financier as a manager to Luxembourg funds. ARI was the investment advisor for Advisory Research Global Funds PLC, an open-ended investment company with variable capital authorized and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland pursuant to the European Communities Regulations (Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities or "UCITS"). Advisory Research Global Funds PLC closed in 2017 and liquidated in 2018. PJIM is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and the National Futures Association ("NFA") as a commodities pool operator. The registrations with the CFTC and NFA allow PJIM to enter into derivative instruments (e.g., interest rate swaps and credit default swap index contracts) to hedge risks associated with certain security positions of funds managed by PJIM. Parallel General Partners Limited is the general partner of several private equity limited partnerships; it and the limited partnerships are registered and regulated by the GFSC.
Certain of our businesses also are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various SROs or exchanges governing the privacy of client information. Any failure with respect to our practices, procedures and controls in any of these areas could subject us to regulatory consequences, including fines, and potentially other significant liabilities.
