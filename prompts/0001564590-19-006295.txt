General
 Company Background
 Barrett Business Services, Inc. (“BBSI,” the “Company,” “our” or “we”), is a leading provider of business management solutions for small and mid-sized companies. The Company has developed a management platform that integrates a knowledge-based approach from the management consulting industry with tools from the human resource outsourcing industry. This platform, through the effective leveraging of human capital, helps our business owner clients run their businesses more effectively. We believe this platform, delivered through a decentralized organizational structure, differentiates BBSI from our competitors. BBSI was incorporated in Maryland in 1965.
 Certain statements below contain forward-looking information that is subject to risks and uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking Information” in Item 7 of Part II of this report and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report.
 Business Strategy
 Our strategy is to align local operations teams with the mission of small and mid-sized business owners, driving value to their business. To do so, BBSI:

• | partners with business owners to leverage their investment in human capital through a high-touch, results-oriented approach;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | brings predictability to each client organization through a three-tiered management platform; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enables business owners to focus on their core business by reducing organizational complexity and maximizing productivity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Organization
 We operate a decentralized delivery model using operationally-focused business teams, typically located within 50 miles of our client companies. These teams are led by senior level business generalists and comprise senior level professionals with expertise in human resources, organizational development, risk mitigation and workplace safety, and various types of administration, including payroll. These teams are responsible for growth of their operations, and for providing strategic leadership, guidance and expert consultation to our client companies. The decentralized structure fosters autonomous decision-making in which business teams deliver plans that closely align with the objectives of each business owner client. This structure also provides a means of incubating talent to support increased growth and capacity. We support clients with employees located in 25 states and the District of Columbia through a network of 62 branch locations in California, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Colorado, Idaho, Arizona, Maryland, North Carolina, Nevada, Delaware, Pennsylvania and Virginia. We also have several smaller recruiting locations in our general market areas, which are under the direction of a branch office.
 BBSI believes that making significant investments in the best talent available allows us to leverage the value of this investment many times over. We motivate our management employees through a compensation package that includes a competitive base salary and the opportunity for profit sharing. At the branch level, profit sharing is in direct correlation to client performance, reinforcing a culture focused on achievement of client goals.

Services Overview
 BBSI’s core purpose is to advocate for business owners, particularly in the small and mid-sized business segment. Our evolution from an entrepreneurially run company to a professionally managed organization has helped to form our view that all businesses experience inflection points at key stages of growth. The insights gained through our own growth, along with the trends we see in working with more than 6,400 companies each day, define our approach to guiding business owners through the challenges associated with being an employer. BBSI’s business teams align with each business owner client through a structured three-tiered progression. In doing so, business teams focus on the objectives of each business owner and deliver planning, guidance and resources in support of those objectives.
Tier 1: Tactical Alignment
 The first stage focuses on the mutual setting of expectations and is essential to a successful client relationship. It begins with a process of assessment and discovery in which the business owner’s business objectives, attitudes, and culture are aligned with BBSI’s processes, controls and culture. This stage includes an implementation process, which addresses the administrative components of employment.
Tier 2: Dynamic Relationship
 The second stage of the relationship emphasizes organizational development as a means of achieving each client’s business objectives. There is a focus on process improvement, development of best practices, supervisor training and leadership development.
Tier 3: Strategic Counsel
 With an emphasis on advocacy on behalf of the business owner, the third stage of the relationship is more strategic and forward-looking with a goal of cultivating an environment in which all efforts are directed by the mission and long-term objectives of the business owner.
 In addition to serving as a resource and guide, BBSI has the ability to provide workers’ compensation coverage as a means of meeting statutory requirements and protecting our clients from employment-related injury claims. Through our third-party administrators, we provide claims management services for our clients. We work aggressively to manage and reduce job injury claims, identify fraudulent claims and structure optimal work programs, including modified duty.
 Categories of Services
 We report financial results in two categories of services: Professional Employer Services (“PEO”) and Staffing. See Item 7 of this Report for information regarding the percentages of total net revenues provided by our PEO and staffing services for each of the last three fiscal years, and our consolidated financial statements incorporated into Item 8 of Part II of this Report for information regarding revenues, net income and total assets in our single reportable segment. 
PEO
 We enter into a client services agreement to establish a co-employment relationship with each client company, assuming responsibility for payroll, payroll taxes, workers’ compensation coverage (if elected) and certain other administrative functions for the client’s existing workforce. The client maintains physical care, custody and control of their workforce, including the authority to hire and terminate employees. During 2018, we supported in excess of 6,400 PEO clients with approximately 195,000 employees. This compares to more than 5,600 PEO clients and approximately 188,000 employees during 2017.

Staffing and Recruiting
 Our staffing services include on-demand or short-term staffing assignments, contract staffing, direct placement, and long-term or indefinite-term on-site management. On-site management employees are BBSI management employees who are based on the client-site and whose jobs are to assist BBSI staffing employees. Our recruiting experts maintain a deep network of professionals from which we source candidates. Through an assessment process, we gain an understanding of the short and long-term needs of our clients, allowing us to identify and source the right talent for each position. We then conduct a rigorous screening process to help ensure a successful hire.
Clients and Client Contracts
 Our business is typically characterized by long-term relationships that result in recurring revenue. The terms and conditions applicable to our client relationships are set forth in a client services agreement, which typically provides for an initial term of one year with renewal for additional one-year periods, but generally permits cancellation by either party upon 30 days’ written notice. In addition, we may terminate the agreement at any time for specified breach of contract, including nonpayment or failure to follow our workplace safety recommendations. 
 The client services agreement also provides for indemnification by the client against losses arising out of any default by the client under the agreement, including failure to comply with any employment-related, health and safety, or immigration laws or regulations. Our client service agreement requires that clients enter into a co-employment arrangement and maintain comprehensive liability coverage in the amount of $1.0 million for acts of their employees. It is nevertheless possible that claims not satisfied through indemnification or insurance may be asserted against us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
 We have client services agreements with a diverse array of customers, including electronics manufacturers, various light-manufacturing industries, agriculture-based companies, transportation and shipping enterprises, food processors, telecommunications companies, public utilities, general contractors in various construction-related fields, and professional services firms. None of our clients individually represented more than 1% of our total revenues in 2018.
 Market Opportunity
 As a company that aligns with the mission of business owners by providing resources and guidance to small and mid-size businesses, BBSI believes its growth is driven by the desire of business owners to focus on mission-critical functions, reduce complexity associated with the employment function, mitigate costs and maximize their investment in human capital. Our integrated management platform has enabled us to capitalize on these needs within the small to mid-size business sector.
 The small and mid‑sized business segment is particularly attractive because:
  
• | it is large, continues to offer significant growth opportunity and remains underserved by professional services companies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it typically has fewer in-house resources than larger businesses and, as a result, is generally more dependent on external resources;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we generally experience a relatively high client retention rate and lower client acquisition costs within this market segment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we have found that small to mid-sized businesses are responsive to quality of service when selecting a PEO or staffing services provider.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 The business environment in which we operate is characterized by intense competition and fragmentation. BBSI is not aware of reliable statistics regarding the number of its competitors, but certain large, well-known companies typically compete with us in the same markets and also have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including Automatic Data Processing, Inc., ManpowerGroup, Inc., Kelly Services, Inc., Insperity, Inc., TriNet Group, Inc., Robert Half International Inc. and Paychex, Inc. We face additional competition from regional providers and we may in the future also face competition from new entrants to the field, including other staffing services companies, payroll processing companies and insurance companies. The principal competitive factors in the business environment in which we operate are price and level of service.
 We believe that our growth is attributable to our ability to provide small and mid-sized companies with the resources and knowledge base of a large employer delivered through a local operations team. Our level of integration with each client business provides us an additional competitive advantage.
 Growth Strategy
 We believe our clients are our best advocates and powerful drivers of referral-based growth. In each market, operations teams provide expertise, consultation and support to our clients, driving growth and supporting retention. We anticipate that by adding business teams to existing branches, we can achieve incremental growth in those markets, driven by our reputation and by client referrals. While in most markets business development efforts are led by area managers, in some markets our sales efforts are further supported by business development managers.
 Our business growth has three primary sources: referrals from existing clients, direct business-to-business sales efforts by our area managers and an extensive referral network. Partners in our referral network include insurance brokers, financial advisors, attorneys, CPA’s, and other business professionals who can facilitate an introduction to prospective clients. These referral partners facilitate introductions to business owners on our behalf, typically in exchange for a fee equal to a small percentage of payroll.
 We see two key drivers to our growth:
  
• | Increase market share in existing markets. We seek to support, strengthen and expand branch office operations through the ongoing development of business teams. We believe that strengthening and expanding the operations of each location is an efficient and effective means of increasing market share in the geographic areas in which we do business, and that our business teams serve a dual purpose: 1) Delivering high-quality service to our clients, thereby supporting client business growth and retention, and driving client referrals, and 2) Incubating talent at the branch level to support expansion into new markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Penetrate new markets. We intend to open additional branch offices in new geographic markets as opportunities arise. We have developed a strategic approach to geographic expansion, which will serve as a guide for determining if and when to enter new markets. We believe our decentralized organizational model built on teams of senior-level professionals allows us to incubate talent to support our expansion efforts.

Workers’ Compensation
 Through our client services agreement, BBSI has the ability to provide workers’ compensation coverage to its clients. We provide this coverage through a variety of methods, all of which are subject to rigorous underwriting to assess financial stability, risk factors and cultural alignment related to safety and the client’s desire to improve their operations. In providing this coverage, we are responsible for complying with applicable statutory requirements for workers' compensation coverage.
 Risk mitigation is also an important contributor to our principal goal of helping business owners operate their business more efficiently. It is in the mutual interests of the client and BBSI to commit to workplace safety and risk mitigation. We maintain clear guidelines for our area managers and risk management consultants, directly tying their continued employment to their diligence in understanding and addressing the risks of accident or injury associated with the industries in which client companies operate and in monitoring clients’ compliance with workplace safety requirements.
 Elements of Workers' Compensation System
 State law (and for certain types of employees, federal law) generally mandates that an employer reimburse its employees for the costs of medical care and other specified benefits for injuries or illnesses, including catastrophic injuries and fatalities, incurred in the course and scope of employment. Most states require employers to maintain workers' compensation insurance or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility to meet workers' compensation obligations to employees. The benefits payable for various categories of claims are determined by state regulation and vary with the severity and nature of the injury or illness and other specified factors. In return for this guaranteed protection, workers' compensation is an exclusive remedy and employees are generally precluded from seeking other damages from their employer for workplace injuries. In many states, employers who meet certain financial and other requirements are permitted to self-insure.
Insurance Coverage for Workers' Compensation
 The Company is a self-insured employer with respect to workers' compensation coverage for all of its employees (including employees co-employed through our client service agreements) working in Colorado, Maryland and Oregon. In the state of Washington, state law allows only the Company's staffing services and internal management employees to be covered under the Company's self-insured workers' compensation program. 
 The Company obtains policies from Chubb for all clients in California, Delaware, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, West Virginia, Idaho, Nevada and the District of Columbia. The arrangement with Chubb, known as a fronted program, provides BBSI a licensed, admitted insurance carrier to issue policies on behalf of BBSI. The risk of loss up to the first $5.0 million per occurrence is retained by BBSI through various agreements. Chubb assumes credit risk should BBSI be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations.
 The Company’s wholly owned, fully licensed captive insurance company incorporated in Arizona, Associated Insurance Company for Excess (“AICE”), provides reinsurance coverage up to $5.0 million per occurrence, except in Maryland and Colorado, where our retention per occurrence is $1.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The Company maintains excess workers’ compensation insurance coverage with Chubb between $5.0 million and statutory limits per occurrence, except in Maryland, where coverage with Chubb is between $1.0 million and statutory limits per occurrence, and in Colorado, where the coverage with Chubb is between $2.0 million and statutory limits per occurrence.
 The Company also operates a wholly owned, fully licensed insurance company, Ecole, which provides workers’ compensation coverage to the Company’s employees working in Arizona and Utah. The Company maintains additional reinsurance coverage for Ecole with Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), for losses above $5.0 million per occurrence.
 The Company restructured its fronted program with Chubb effective July 1, 2018. The new agreement maintains retention levels of $5.0 million per occurrence but now requires that collateral be advanced at the inception of the policy term. To partially satisfy these additional collateral requirements, the Company provided a surety bond of $30.0 million and a letter of credit of $63.7 million from its principal bank, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Bank”).

Overall, this approach results in a per occurrence retention on a consolidated basis of $5.0 million for most claims. In light of the per occurrence retention, we may experience significant workers' compensation costs from catastrophic claims, should they occur.
 Claims Management
 As a result of our status as a self-insured employer in four states and our retention arrangements, our workers' compensation expense is tied directly to the incidence and severity of covered workplace injuries. We seek to contain our workers' compensation costs through an aggressive approach to claims management. We use managed-care systems to reduce medical costs and keep time-loss costs to a minimum by assigning injured workers, whenever possible, to short-term assignments which accommodate the workers' physical limitations. We believe that these assignments minimize both time actually lost from work and covered time-loss costs. We engage third-party claims administrators ("TPAs") to provide the primary claims management expertise. Typical claims management procedures include performing thorough and prompt on-site investigations of claims filed by employees, working with physicians to encourage efficient medical management of cases, denying questionable claims and attempting to negotiate early settlements to eliminate future adverse development of claims costs. We also maintain a corporate-wide pre-employment drug screening program and a post-injury drug test program. We believe our claims management program has resulted in a reduction in the frequency of fraudulent claims and in accidents in which the use of illicit drugs appears to have been a contributing factor.
Employees and Employee Benefits
 At December 31, 2018, we had 122,958 total employees, including 115,188 employees under our client service agreements, 7,019 staffing services employees, 746 managerial, sales and administrative employees (together, “management employees”), and 5 executive officers. The number of employees at any given time may vary significantly due to business conditions at customer or client companies. We believe our employee relations are good.
 We offer various qualified employee benefit plans to our employees, including those employees for whom we are the administrative employer in a co-employment arrangement who so elect. Employees covered under a PEO arrangement may participate in our 401(k) plan at the sole discretion of the PEO client. Our qualified staffing and management employee benefit plans include our 401(k) plan, in which employees may enroll upon reaching 21 years of age and completing 1,000 hours of service in a 12 consecutive month period. We make matching contributions to the 401(k) plan under a safe harbor provision, which are immediately 100% vested. We match 100% of contributions by management and staffing employees up to 3% of each participating employee's annual compensation and 50% of the employee's contributions up to an additional 2% of annual compensation. We may also make discretionary contributions to the 401(k) plan, which vest over six years and are subject to certain legal limits, at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 We also offer a cafeteria plan under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code and group health, life insurance and disability insurance plans to qualified staffing and management employees. Generally, qualified employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code, qualified plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees.
 Certain highly compensated employees of the Company are allowed to participate in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Under the plan, participants are permitted to defer receipt for income tax purposes of up to 90% of salary and up to 100% of any incentive bonus. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on investment earnings of participant-selected investments. As an incentive to participate in the plan, the Company awards restricted stock units with a value equal to 35% of the amount deferred under the plan, up to a maximum of $75,000 per year. The restricted stock units vest in full on the fifth anniversary of the grant date, contingent on the continued employment of the participant.

The Company established a Rabbi trust under which compensation deferred by participants is deposited and held separately from the Company's other assets, subject to the claims of the Company's creditors in the event of its bankruptcy or insolvency.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Acts”) subject us to potential penalties unless we offer to our employees minimum essential healthcare coverage that is affordable. Because each PEO client is considered to be the sole employer in the application of any rule or law included within the scope of the Acts, we do not offer health care coverage to the employees of our PEO clients. However, in order to comply with the employer mandate provision of the Acts, we offer health care coverage to all eligible staffing employees and management employees eligible for coverage under the Acts. 
 Regulatory and Legislative Issues
 We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions within which we operate, including those governing self-insured employers under the workers' compensation systems in Oregon, Maryland, and Colorado, as well as in Washington for staffing and management employees. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing our two wholly owned insurance companies in Arizona. While the specific laws and regulations vary among these jurisdictions, they typically require some form of licensing and often have statutory requirements for workplace safety and notice of change in obligation of workers’ compensation coverage in the event of contract termination. Although compliance with these requirements imposes some additional financial risk, particularly with respect to those clients who breach their payment obligation to us, such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business to date.
 Our operations are affected by numerous federal and state laws relating to labor, tax and employment matters. Through our client services agreement, we assume certain obligations and responsibilities as the administrative employer under federal and state laws. Since many of these federal and state laws were enacted prior to the development of nontraditional employment relationships, such as professional employer, temporary employment, and outsourcing arrangements, many of these laws do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of nontraditional employers. In addition, the definition of "employer" under these laws is not uniform.
 As an employer, we are subject to all federal statutes and regulations governing our employer-employee relationships. Subject to the discussion of risk factors below, we believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal statutes and regulations.
