 Major Businesses
 On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off of its Transportation Systems business, formerly part of Aerospace, and on October 29, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off of its Homes and Global Distribution business, formerly part of Home and Building Technologies. Therefore, as of the end of 2018, those businesses were no longer part of the Company. Following the spin-off of the Homes and Global Distribution business, the Home and Building Technologies segment was renamed Honeywell Building Technologies. The major products/services, customers/uses and key competitors of each of our segments are:

Competition
 We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are:
 
 | Aerospace: Garmin, Thales, Safran and United Technologies 
 | Honeywell Building Technologies: Emerson Electric, Itron, Johnson Controls, Schneider Electric and Siemens 
 | Performance Materials and Technologies: Albemarle, BASF, DowDupont, Emerson Electric and Sinopec 
 | Safety and Productivity Solutions: 3M, Mine Safety Appliances (MSA), Kion Group, TE Connectivity and Zebra Technologies

 Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs.
 Aerospace Sales
 Our Aerospace segment sales were 37%, 36% and 38% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 7%, 6% and 6% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 13%, 13% and 12% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

 U.S. Government Sales
 Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,403 million, $3,203 million and $3,330 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,832 million, $2,546 million and $2,647 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2019 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified commercial businesses.
Backlog
 Our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Starting in 2018 following the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog was $24,850 million and $17,690 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We expect to recognize approximately 56% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2019, and the remaining balance thereafter.
International Operations
 We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development (R&D) globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 13% of our total sales in 2018, 12% in 2017 and 13% in 2016. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 43% of our total sales in 2018, 44% in 2017 and 43% in 2016.

Manufactured Products and Systems andPerformance of Services | | Year Ended December 31, 2018
 | Aerospace | | HoneywellBuildingTechnologies | | PerformanceMaterials andTechnologies | Safety andProductivitySolutions
 | | (% of Segment Sales) 
U.S. Exports | | | | 21 | % | | 1 | % | 16 | % | 3 | %

 Information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.
 Raw Materials
 The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2018. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials.
 The costs of certain key raw materials, including R240, copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, and perchloroethylene in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2019.

 Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights
 Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business.
Environment
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
 We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacturing, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.
 Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.
 We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or financial standing. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
 Employees
 We have approximately 114,000 employees at December 31, 2018, of whom approximately 44,000 are located in the United States.
