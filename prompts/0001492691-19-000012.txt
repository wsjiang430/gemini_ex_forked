Company Overview

Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. is North America's largest truckload carrier and a provider of transportation solutions, from its Phoenix, Arizona headquarters. The Company provides multiple truckload transportation, intermodal, and logistics services using a nationwide network of business units and terminals in the US and Mexico to serve customers throughout North America. In addition to its truckload services, Knight-Swift also contracts with third-party capacity providers to provide a broad range of truckload services to its customers while creating quality driving jobs for our driving associates and successful business opportunities for independent contractors. 
During 2018, we covered 1.9 billion loaded miles for shippers throughout North America, contributing to consolidated total revenue of $5.3 billion and consolidated operating income of $569.0 million. During 2018, we operated an average of 15,743 company tractors, 3,413 independent contractor tractors, and 69,544 trailers within our Knight Trucking, Swift Truckload, Swift Dedicated, and Swift Refrigerated segments. Additionally, we operated an average 640 tractors and 9,330 intermodal containers within our Swift Intermodal segment. The Company's six reportable segments are Knight Trucking, Swift Truckload, Swift Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated, Knight Logistics, and Swift Intermodal.
We have historically grown through a combination of organic growth, as well as through mergers and acquisitions (discussed below). Mergers and acquisitions have enhanced Knight's and Swift's businesses and service offerings with additional terminals, driving associates, revenue equipment, and capacity. Our multiple service offerings, capabilities, and transportation modes enable us to transport, or arrange transportation for, general commodities for our diversified customer base throughout the contiguous US and Mexico using our equipment, information technology, and qualified driving associates and non-driver employees. We are committed to providing our customers with a wide range of truckload, intermodal, and logistics services and continuing to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers across multiple service offerings and transportation modes. Our overall objective is to provide truckload, intermodal, and logistics services that, when combined, lead the industry for margin and growth, while providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for our customers.

Business Combinations and Investments

2017 Merger
On September 8, 2017, we became Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. upon the effectiveness of the 2017 Merger. We accounted for the 2017 Merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that either Knight or Swift is designated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes ("Accounting Acquirer"). Based on the evidence available, Knight was designated as the Accounting Acquirer while Swift was the acquirer for legal purposes. Therefore, Knight’s historical results of operations replaced Swift’s historical results of operations for all periods prior to the 2017 Merger. See Note 5 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more details regarding the 2017 Merger.
Historical Acquisitions
Knight — Since 1999, Knight has acquired all of the outstanding stock of six short-to-medium haul truckload carriers, or has acquired substantially all of the trucking assets of such carriers, including Iowa-based Barr-Nunn (acquired in 2014), and Virginia-based Abilene (acquired in 2018).
Swift — Since 1966, Swift has completed thirteen acquisitions, including the 2013 acquisition of Central Refrigerated Transportation, LLC (formerly Central Refrigerated Transportation, Inc.).

Industry and Competition

Truckload carriers represent the largest part of the transportation supply chain for most retail and manufactured goods in North America and typically transport a full trailer (or container) of freight for a single customer from origin to destination without intermediate sorting and handling. Generally, the truckload industry is compensated based on miles, whereas the less-than-truckload industry is compensated based on package size and/or weight. Overall, the US trucking industry is large, fragmented, and highly competitive. We compete with thousands of truckload carriers, most of whom operate significantly smaller fleets than we do. Our trucking segments compete with other motor carriers for the services of driving associates, independent contractors, and management employees. To a lesser extent, our intermodal services, as well as our freight brokerage and logistics businesses, compete with railroads, less-than-truckload carriers, logistics providers, and other transportation companies. Our logistics businesses compete with other logistics companies for the services of third-party capacity providers and management employees.
Our industry has encountered the following major economic cycles since 2000: 

Period | Economic Cycle 
2000 — 2001 | industry over-capacity and depressed freight volumes 
2002 — 2006 | economic expansion 
2007 — 2009 | freight slowdown, fuel price spike, economic recession, and credit crisis 
2010 — 2013 | moderate recovery. The industry freight data began to show positive trends for both volume and pricing. The slow, steady growth is a result of moderate increases in gross domestic product, coupled with a tighter supply of available tractors. Trends in supply of available tractors were lower due to several years of below average truck builds, an increase in truckload fleet bankruptcies in 2009 and 2010, increasing equipment prices due to stringent EPA requirements, less available credit, and less driver availability. 
2014 — 2016 | return to pre-recession levels and relative stabilization. In 2014, total spending on transportation, which fell during the 2007 – 2009 recession, returned to pre-recession levels. Truck tonnage grew throughout 2014, followed by decelerating growth in 2015, and relative stabilization in 2016. Capacity became looser in 2015 and 2016, as inventory levels were high and large volumes of tractor purchases created a supply/demand imbalance, putting pressure on pricing. Fuel prices declined. 
2017 — 2018 | strong cycle, driven by a record pricing climate. The industry experienced increased demand for transportation services, including contract and non-contract market demand, partially due to a strong retail season. Capacity became tighter in the second half of 2017 and throughout 2018, due to increasing government regulation, the driver shortage, and severe storms interrupting business, among other factors. 

The principal means of competition in our industry are customer service, capacity, and price. In times of strong freight demand, customer service and capacity become increasingly important, and in times of weak freight demand, pricing becomes increasingly important. Most truckload contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee truck availability or shipment volumes. Pricing is influenced by supply and demand.
The trucking industry faces the following primary challenges, which we believe we are well-positioned to address, as discussed under "Our Competitive Strengths" and "Our Mission and Company Strategy," below:

• | tightening industry capacity;


• | cumulative impacts of regulatory initiatives, such as ELDs, hours-of service limitations for drivers, and others;


• | uncertainty in the economic environment, including changing supply chain and consumer spending patterns;


• | driver shortages;


• | significant and rapid fluctuations in fuel prices; and


• | increased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, and volatility in the used equipment sales market.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that our principal competitive strengths are our regional presence, customer service (including our ability to provide multiple transportation solutions, and configuration of equipment that satisfies customers' needs), operating efficiency, cost control, and technological enhancements in our revenue equipment and supporting back-office functions.

Regional Presence 
We believe that regional operations, which expanded with the merger between Knight and Swift, offer several advantages, including:• obtaining greater freight volumes,• achieving higher revenue per mile by focusing on high-density freight lanes to minimize non-revenue miles,• enhancing our ability to recruit and train qualified driving associates,• enhancing safety and driver development and retention,• enhancing our ability to provide a high level of service and consistent capacity to our customers,• enhancing accountability for performance and growth,• furthering our trucking capabilities to provide various shipping solutions to our customers, and• furthering our logistics capabilities to contract with more third-party capacity providers. 
Operating Efficiency and Cost Control 
We expect to generate cost and revenue synergies as a result of the 2017 Merger through, among other things, increased operational efficiencies through the adoption of best practices and capabilities from each of Knight and Swift, as well as the overall size of our combined company. We operate modern tractors and trailers in order to obtain operating efficiencies and attract and retain driving associates. We believe a generally compatible fleet of tractors and trailers simplifies our maintenance procedures and reduces parts, supplies, and maintenance costs. We regulate vehicle speed, which we believe will maximize fuel efficiency, reduce wear and tear, and enhance safety. We continue to update our fleet with more fuel-efficient post-2014 US EPA emission compliant engines, install aerodynamic devices on our tractors, and equip our trailers with trailer blades, which have led to meaningful improvements in fuel efficiency. Our logistics and intermodal businesses focus on effectively optimizing and meeting the transportation and logistics requirements of our customers and providing customers with various sources and modes of transportation capacity across our nationwide service network. We invest in technology that enhances our ability to optimize our freight opportunities while maintaining a low cost per transaction.
Customer Service 
We strive to provide superior, on-time service at a meaningful value to our customers and seek to establish ourselves as a preferred truckload and logistics provider for our customers. We provide truckload capacity for customers in high-density lanes, where we can provide them with a high level of service, as well as flexible and customized logistics services on a nationwide basis. Our trucking services include dry van, refrigerated, and drayage, which also include dedicated and cross-border truckload services, customized according to customer needs. Our logistics and intermodal services include brokerage, intermodal, and certain logistics, freight management, and non-trucking services, which provide various shipping alternatives and transportation modes for customers by utilizing our expansive network of third-party capacity providers and rail partners. We price our trucking, logistics, and intermodal services commensurately with the level of service our customers require and market conditions. By providing customers a high level of service, we believe we avoid competing solely based on price. 
Using Technology that Enhances Our Business 
We purchase and deploy technology that we believe will allow us to operate more safely, securely, and efficiently. Substantially all of our company-owned tractors are equipped with in-cab communication devices that enable us to communicate with our driving associates, obtain load position updates, manage our fleets, and provide our customers with freight visibility, as well as with ELDs that automatically record our driving associates' hours-of-service. The majority of our trailers are equipped with trailer-tracking technology that allows us to better manage our trailers. We have purchased and developed software for our logistics businesses that provides greater visibility of the capacity of our third-party providers and enhances our ability to provide our customers with solutions that offer a superior level of service. We have automated many of our back-office functions, and we continue to invest in technology that we expect will allow us to better serve our customers and improve overall efficiency.

Our Mission and Company Strategy

Our mission is to operate truckload businesses that are industry leading in both margin and growth, while providing cost-effective solutions for our customers. Our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in providing transportation and logistics solutions to our customers, as well as our ability to leverage efficiencies and best practices between Knight and Swift. We evaluate growth opportunities based on customer demand and supply chain trends, availability of drivers and third-party capacity providers, expected returns on invested capital, expected net cash flows, and our company-specific capabilities.

Segment Operating Strategies
Trucking Segments | Our operating strategy for our trucking segments, which includes Knight Trucking, Swift Truckload, Swift Dedicated, and Swift Refrigerated, is to achieve a high level of asset utilization within a highly disciplined operating system, while maintaining strict controls over our cost structure. We hope to achieve these goals by primarily operating in high-density, predictable freight lanes and attempting to develop and expand our customer base around each of our terminals by providing multiple truckload services for each customer. We believe this operating strategy allows us to take advantage of the large amount of freight transported in the markets we serve. Our terminals enable us to better serve our customers and work more closely with our driving associates. We operate a premium modern fleet that we believe appeals to driving associates and customers, reduces maintenance expenses and driving associate and equipment downtime, and enhances our fuel and other operating efficiencies. We employ technology in a cost-effective manner to assist us in controlling operating costs and enhancing revenue. 
Logistics businesses | Our logistics operating strategy is to match the shipping needs of our customers with the capacity provided by our network of third-party carriers and our rail providers. Our goal is to increase our market presence, both in existing operating regions and in other areas where we believe the freight environment meets our operating strategy, while seeking to achieve industry-leading operating margins and returns on investment. 
Swift Intermodal | Our Swift Intermodal operating strategy is to complement our regional operating model, allowing us to better serve customers in longer haul lanes, and reduce our investment in fixed assets. We have intermodal agreements with most major North American rail carriers, which have helped increase our volumes through more competitive pricing. 


Growth Strategies 
We believe we have the terminal network, systems capability, and management capacity to support substantial growth. We have established a geographically diverse network that we believe can support a substantial increase in freight volumes, organic or acquired. Our network and business lines afford us the ability to provide multiple transportation solutions for our customers, and we maintain the flexibility within our network to adapt to freight market conditions. We believe our unique mix of regional management, together with our consistent efforts to centralize certain business functions to achieve collective economies of scale, allow us to develop future company leaders with relevant operating and industry experience, minimize the potential diseconomies of scale that can come with growth in size, take advantage of regional knowledge concerning capacity and customer shipping needs, and manage our overall business with a high level of performance accountability.
Strengthening our customer relationships | We market our services to both existing and new customers who value our broad geographic coverage, suite of transportation and logistics services, and industry-leading truckload capacity and freight lanes that complement our existing operations. We seek customers who will diversify our freight base. We market our dry van, refrigerated, drayage, brokerage, and intermodal services, including dedicated and cross-border services within those offerings, to logistics customers seeking a single-source provider of multiple services but do not currently take advantage of our array of truckload solutions.
Improving asset productivity | We focus on improving the revenue generated from our tractors and trailers without compromising safety. We anticipate that we can accomplish this objective through increased miles driven and rate per mile. 
Acquiring and growing opportunistically | We regularly evaluate potential opportunities for mergers, acquisitions, and other development and growth opportunities. In addition to the merger between Knight and Swift in 2017, since 1999, Knight has acquired six short-to-medium haul truckload carriers, including the acquisitions of Barr-Nunn during 2014 and Abilene during 2018, and Swift has acquired thirteen companies since 1966. 
Expanding existing terminals | Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue growth has been generated by our expansion into new geographic regions through the opening of additional terminals. Although we continue to seek opportunities to further increase our business in this manner, our primary focus is on developing and expanding our existing terminals by strengthening our customer relationships, recruiting qualified driving associates and non-driver employees, adding new customers, and expanding the range of transportation and logistics solutions offered from these terminals. 
Diversifying our service offerings | We are committed to providing our customers a broad and growing range of truckload and logistics services and continue to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for our customers. We believe that these offerings contribute meaningfully to our results and reflect our strategy to bring complementary services to our customers to assist them with their supply chain needs. We plan to continue to leverage our nationwide footprint and expertise to add value to our customers through our diversified service offerings.

Customers and Marketing

Marketing
Our marketing mission is to be a strategic, efficient transportation capacity partner for our customers by providing truckload and logistics solutions customizable to the unique needs of our customers. We deliver these capacity solutions through our network of owned assets, independent contractors, third-party capacity providers, and our rail providers. The diverse and premium services we offer provide a comprehensive approach to providing ample supply chain solutions to our customers. At December 31, 2018, we had a sales staff of approximately 100 individuals across the US and Mexico, who work closely with management to establish and expand accounts. Our sales and marketing leaders are members of our senior management team, who are assisted by other sales professionals in each segment. Our sales team emphasizes our industry-leading service, environmental leadership, and our ability to accommodate a variety of customer needs, provide consistent capacity, and financial strength and stability.
Customers
Our customers are typically large corporations in the retail (including discount and online retail), food and beverage, consumer products, paper products, transportation and logistics, housing and building, automotive, and manufacturing industries. Many of our customers have extensive operations, geographically distributed locations, and diverse shipping needs. 
Consistent with industry practice, our typical customer contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee shipment volumes by our customers or truck availability by us. This affords us and our customers some flexibility to negotiate rates in response to changes in freight demand and industry-wide truck capacity. Our dedicated services within the Swift Dedicated and Knight Trucking segments assign particular driving associates and revenue equipment to prescribed routes, pursuant to multi-year agreements. This provides individual customers with a guaranteed source of capacity, and allows our driving associates to have more predictable schedules and routes. Under our dedicated transportation services, we provide driving associates, equipment, maintenance, and, in some instances, transportation management services that supplement the customer's in-house transportation department. 
Our terminals are linked to our corporate information technology system in our Phoenix headquarters. The capabilities of this system and its software enhance our operating efficiency by providing cost-effective access to detailed information concerning equipment location and availability, shipment tracking, on-time delivery status, and other specific customer requirements. The system also enables us to respond promptly and accurately to customer requests and assists us in geographically matching available equipment with customer loads. Additionally, our customers can track shipments and obtain copies of shipping documents via our website. We also provide electronic data interchange services to customers desiring these services. 
We believe our fleet capacity, terminal network, customer service and breadth of services offer a competitive advantage to major shippers, particularly in times of rising freight volumes when shippers must quickly access capacity across multiple facilities and regions.
We strive to maintain a diversified customer base. Services provided to the Company's largest customer, Walmart, generated 14.6%, 15.8%, and 13.7% of total revenue in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Revenue generated by Walmart is reported in each of our reportable operating segments. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2018, 2017, or 2016.
Our top 25 customers drive a substantial portion of our total revenue, as follows (amounts reflect only Swift's results prior to the 2017 Merger date, and Knight-Swift's results after the 2017 Merger date):

• | In 2018, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 50.1%, 34.6%, and 27.2% of our total revenue, respectively.


• | In 2017, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 56.6%, 39.7%, and 31.7% of our total revenue, respectively.


• | In 2016, our top 25, top 10, and top 5 customers accounted for 53.7%, 37.3%, and 27.7% of our total revenue, respectively.

Revenue Equipment

We operate a modern company tractor fleet to help attract and retain driving associates, promote safe operations, and reduce maintenance and repair costs.
In 2018, we obtained all of our revenue equipment only through cash purchases, and in the future, we will continue to monitor leasing opportunities. We typically obtain tractors and trailers manufactured to our specifications in order to meet a wide variety of customer needs. Growth of our tractor and trailer fleet is determined by market conditions and our experience and expectations regarding equipment utilization. In acquiring revenue equipment, we consider a number of factors, including economy, price, rate, economic environment, technology, warranty terms, manufacturer support, driving associate comfort, and resale value. We maintain strong relationships with our equipment vendors and have the financial flexibility to react as market conditions dictate. 
Our current policy is to replace our tractors between 42 months and 60 months after purchase and to replace our trailers over a five- to ten-year period. Changes in the current market for used tractors and trailers, regulatory changes, and difficult market conditions faced by tractor and trailer manufacturers, may result in price increases that may affect the period of time for which we operate our equipment.
Our newer equipment has enhanced features, which we believe tends to lower the overall life cycle costs by reducing safety-related expenses, lowering repair and maintenance expenses, improving fuel economy, and improving driving associate satisfaction. In 2019 and beyond, we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of this relatively short tractor trade-in cycle against the lower capital expenditure and financing costs of a longer tractor trade-in cycle, based on current and future business needs.

Employees

The strength of our company is our people, working together with common goals. There were approximately 22,600 full-time employees in our total headcount of approximately 22,800 employees as of December 31, 2018, which was comprised of: 

Company driving associates (including driver trainees) | 17,200
Technicians and other equipment maintenance personnel | 1,200 
Support personnel (such as corporate managers, sales, and administrative personnel) | 4,400 
Total | 22,800

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 800 Trans-Mex driving associates in Mexico that were represented by a union.
Company Driving Associates
We recognize that the recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driving associate workforce, which is one of our most valuable assets, are essential to our continued growth and meeting the service requirements of our customers. In order to attract and retain safe driving associates who are committed to the highest levels of customer service and safety, we focus our operations for driving associates around a collaborative and supportive team environment. We provide late model and comfortable equipment, direct communication with senior management, competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives designed to encourage driving associate safety, retention, and long-term employment. We have established various driving academies across the US. Our academies are strategically located in areas where external driver-training organizations were lacking. In other areas of the US, we have contracted with driver training schools, which are managed by third parties. There are certain minimum qualifications for candidates to be accepted into the academy, including passing the DOT physical examination and drug/alcohol screening.
Terminal Staff
Most of our large terminals are staffed with terminal leaders, fleet leaders, driver leaders, planners, safety coordinators, shop leaders, technicians, and customer service representatives. Our terminal leaders work with driver leaders, customer service representatives, and other operations personnel to coordinate the needs of both our customers and our driving associates. Terminal leaders are also responsible for serving existing customers in their areas. Fleet leaders supervise driver leaders, who are responsible for the general operation of our trucks and their driving associates, focusing on driving associate retention, productivity per truck, fuel consumption, fuel efficiency (with respect to driver-controllable idle time), safety, and scheduled maintenance. Customer service representatives are assigned specific customers to ensure specialized, high-quality service, and frequent customer contact.

KNIGHT-SWIFT TRANSPORTATION HOLDINGS INC.


Independent Contractors

In addition to Knight-Swift-employed driving associates, we enter into contractor agreements with third parties who own and operate tractors (or hire their own driving associates to operate the tractors) that service our customers. We pay these independent contractors for their services, based on a contracted rate per mile. By operating safely and productively, independent contractors can improve their own profitability and ours. Independent contractors are responsible for most costs incurred for owning and operating their tractors. As of December 31, 2018, independent contractors comprised 13.2% of our total fleet, as measured by ending tractor count. 

Safety and Insurance

Safety
We are committed to safe and secure operations. We conduct a mandatory intensive driver qualification process, including defensive driving training for all drivers, which includes our company driving associates. We require prospective drivers to meet higher qualification standards than those required by the DOT, including extensive background checks and hair follicle drug testing. We regularly communicate with drivers to promote safety and instill safe work habits through effective use of various media and safety review sessions. We dedicate personnel and resources designed to ensure safe operation and regulatory compliance. We employ technology to assist us in managing risks associated with our business. In addition, we have an innovative recognition program for driver safety performance and emphasize safety through our equipment specifications and maintenance programs. Our Corporate Directors of Safety review all accidents and report weekly to the Vice President of Safety and Risk Management. 
Insurance
The primary claims arising in our business consist of auto liability, including personal injury, property damage, physical damage, and cargo loss. We self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses. We also maintain insurance that covers our directors and officers for losses and expenses arising out of claims, based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers. While under dispatch and our operating authority, the independent contractors we contract with are covered by our liability coverage and self-insurance retention limits. However, each is responsible for physical damage to his or her own equipment, occupational accident coverage, and liability exposure while the truck is used for non-company purposes. Additionally, fleet operators are responsible for any applicable workers' compensation requirements for their employees.
Swift — The following table includes Swift's self-insured retention amounts, maximum benefits per claim, and other limitations:

Insurance | Limits 
Automobile Liability, General Liability, and Excess Liability | $250.0 million of coverage per occurrence, subject to a $10.0 million self-insured retention per-occurrence. 
Cargo Damage and Loss | $2.0 million limit per truck or trailer with a $10.0 million limit per occurrence; provided that there is a $1.0 million limit for tobacco loads and a $250 thousand deductible 
Workers' Compensation/Employers' Liability | Statutory coverage limits; employers' liability of $1.0 million bodily injury by accident and disease, subject to a $5.0 million self-insured retention for each accident or disease
Health Care | Swift is fully insured for medical benefits, subject to contributed premiums. 

Swift insures certain casualty risks through its wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, Mohave and Red Rock. Mohave and Red Rock provide reinsurance associated with a share of our automobile liability risk. In addition to insuring a proportionate share of our corporate casualty risk, Mohave provides reinsurance coverage to third-party insurance companies associated with Swift affiliated companies' independent contractors.
Knight — The following table includes information regarding Knight's main insurance programs:

Insurance | Limits 
Automobile Liability | $250.0 million of coverage per occurrence ($130.0 million through October 31, 2018, subject to a $1.0 million per occurrence self-insured retention, and a $2.5 million aggregate deductible for any loss within the excess coverage layer)
Workers' Compensation | $1.0 million self-insured retention per occurrence. 
Employee Medical and Hospitalization | Primary and excess coverage for employee medical expenses and hospitalization, with $0.3 million self-insured retention per claimant.

Fuel

We actively manage our fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce our fuel costs. Additionally, we utilize a fuel surcharge program to pass a majority of increases in fuel costs to our customers. In 2018, we purchased 26.9% of our fuel in bulk at our Swift, Knight, and dedicated customer locations across the US and Mexico. We purchased substantially all of the remainder through a network of retail truck stops with which we have negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The volumes we purchase at terminals and through the fuel network vary based on procurement costs and other factors. We seek to reduce our fuel costs by routing our driving associates to truck stops when fuel prices at such stops are cheaper than the bulk rate paid for fuel at our terminals. We primarily store fuel in above-ground storage tanks at most of our other bulk fueling terminals. We believe that we are sufficiently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and dispensing of fuel.

Seasonality

In the transportation industry, results of operations generally follow a seasonal pattern. Freight volumes in the first quarter are typically lower due to less consumer demand, customers reducing shipments following the holiday season, and inclement weather. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, and tractor productivity of the Company's fleet, independent contractors, and third-party carriers decreases during the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold-weather-related equipment maintenance and repairs, and increased insurance claims and costs attributed to higher accident frequency from harsh weather. These factors typically lead to lower operating profitability, as compared to other parts of the year. Additionally, beginning in the latter half of the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter, the Company typically experiences surges pertaining to holiday shopping trends toward delivery of gifts purchased over the Internet as well as the length of the holiday season (consumer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas).

Environmental Regulation

General
We have bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at many of our terminals, as well as vehicle maintenance, repair, and washing operations at some of our facilities, which exposes us to certain environmental risks. Soil and groundwater contamination have occurred at some of our facilities in prior years, for which we have been responsible for remediating the environmental contamination. Also, a small percentage of our total shipments contain hazardous materials, which are generally rated as low to medium-risk, and subject us to a wide array of regulation. In the past, we have been responsible for the costs of clean-up of cargo and diesel fuel spills caused by traffic accidents or other events. 
We have instituted programs to monitor and mitigate environmental risks and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws governing the hauling, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials, fuel spillage or seepage, emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine-idling, discharge and retention of storm water, and other environmental matters. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform internal environmental reviews. We are a Charter Partner in the EPA's SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with current laws and regulations and do not know of any existing environmental condition that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
If we are held responsible for the cleanup of any environmental incidents or conditions caused by our operations or business, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to clean-up costs and other liabilities, including substantial fines, penalties and/or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have paid penalties for spills and violations in the past; however, they have not been material to our financial results or position.
Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards
California ARB — In 2008, the State of California's Air Resources Board ("ARB") approved the Heavy-Duty Vehicle GHG Emission Reduction Regulation in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from certain long-haul tractor-trailers that operate in California by requiring them to utilize technologies that improve fuel efficiency (regardless of where the vehicle is registered). The regulation, which became effective in 2010, required owners of long-haul tractors and 53-foot trailers to be EPA SmartWay certified or replace or retrofit their vehicles with aerodynamic technologies and low-rolling resistance tires. The regulation also contained certain emissions and registration standards for refrigerated trailers.
In December 2013, California's ARB approved regulations to align its GHG emission standards and test procedures, as well as its tractor-trailer GHG regulation, with the federal Phase 1 GHG regulation (see below). 
Additionally, in February 2018, California's ARB approved California Phase 2 standards that generally align with the federal Phase 2 standards, with some minor additional requirements, and which would stay in place even if the federal Phase 2 standards are affected by action from President Trump's administration.  In February 2019, the California Phase 2 standards became final.

EPA and NHTSA — The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") began taking coordinated steps in support of a new generation of clean vehicles and engines through reduced GHG emissions and improved fuel efficiency at a national level. 

• | Phase 1 — In September 2011, the EPA finalized federal regulations for controlling GHG emissions, beginning with model-year 2014 medium- and heavy-duty engines and vehicles and increasing in stringency through model-year 2018. The federal regulations relate to efficient engines, use of auxiliary power units, mass reduction, low-rolling resistance tires, improved aerodynamics, improved transmissions, and reduced accessory loads.


• | Phase 2 — In June 2015, the EPA and NHTSA, working in concert with California's ARB, formally announced a proposed national program establishing Phase 2 of the GHG emissions and fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for model-year 2018 and beyond. In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA announced the final rule regarding Phase 2, which builds upon Phase 1, and would apply to certain trailer types beginning with model-year 2018 for EPA standards (voluntary for NHTSA standards through model-year 2020). Tractors and certain trailer types would be subject to the Phase 2 standards beginning with model-year 2021, increasing in stringency through model-year 2024, and phasing in completely by model-year 2027. This rule marks the first time federal mandates will be applied to trailers, with respect to aerodynamics and low-rolling resistance tires. The final rule was effective December 27, 2016. 

In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). The outcome of such proposal is still undetermined as the EPA continues to consider Congressionally requested investigations into the legality of the proposal and the merits of an anti-glider study that was published shortly after the proposal became official. Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 standards as they relate to trailers has been delayed due to a provisional stay granted in October 2017 by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is overseeing a case against the EPA by the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, Inc. regarding the Phase 2 standards. If the glider provisions are removed from the Phase 2 standards, there would be no direct effect on our results of operations. If the trailer provisions of the Phase 2 standards are permanently removed, we would still need to ensure the majority of our fleet is compliant with the California Phase 2 standards.
Complying with these and any future GHG regulations enacted by California’s ARB, the EPA, the NHTSA and/or any other state or federal governing body has increased and will likely continue to increase the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of new trailers, may require us to retrofit certain of our trailers, may increase our maintenance costs, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating costs, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings.  These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of our equipment, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted. We will continue monitoring our compliance with federal and state GHG regulations.
Climate-change Proposals
Federal and state lawmakers are considering a variety of other climate-change proposals related to carbon emissions and GHG emissions. The proposals could potentially limit carbon emissions within certain states and municipalities, which continue to restrict the location and amount of time that diesel-powered tractors (like ours) may idle. 
These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our driving associates' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity, or increase in driving associate turnover.

Industry Regulation

Our operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local government agencies in North America, including the DOT, the FMCSA, and the US Department of Homeland Security, among others. Our company, as well as our driving associates and independent contractors, must comply with enacted governmental regulations regarding safety, equipment, and operating methods. Examples include regulation of equipment weight, equipment dimensions, driver hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, and ergonomics. The following discussion presents recently enacted federal, state, and local regulations that could have an impact on our operations.
Hours-of-service
From time to time, the FMCSA proposes and implements changes to regulations impacting hours-of-service. Such changes can negatively impact our productivity and affect our operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week our driving associates and independent contractors may operate and/or disrupting our network. No such changes are currently proposed. However, the FMCSA recently indicated it may soon be soliciting feedback from industry stakeholders regarding future hours-of-service changes. Any future changes to hours-of-service regulations could materially and adversely affect our operations and profitability.

Safety and Fitness Ratings
There are currently two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers: CSA, which evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards by analyzing data from recent safety events and investigation results, and the DOT safety rating, which is based on an on-site investigation and affects a carrier's ability to operate in interstate commerce. Additionally, the FMCSA has proposed rules in the past that would change the methodologies used to determine carrier safety and fitness. 
DOT Safety Rating — The DOT safety rating is currently the only safety measurement system that has a direct impact on a carrier's ability to operate in interstate commerce. Both Knight and Swift currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating, which is the best available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating.
CSA — In December 2010, the FMCSA introduced CSA, an enforcement and compliance model that ranks on seven categories of safety-related data. The seven categories of safety-related data, currently include Unsafe Driving, Hours-of-Service Compliance, Driver Fitness, Controlled Substances/Alcohol, Vehicle Maintenance, Hazardous Materials Compliance, and Crash Indicator, (such categories known as "BASICs").  Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (i.e. crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile or score to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold.  
Certain CSA scores were initially published and made available to the general public. However, in December 2015, as part of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation ("FAST") Act, Congress mandated that the FMCSA remove all CSA scores from public view until a more comprehensive study regarding the effectiveness of CSA improving truck safety could be completed. During this period of review by the FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. The study was conducted and delivered to the FMCSA in June 2017 with several recommendations to make the CSA program more fair, accurate, and reliable. In late June 2018, the FMCSA provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program in response to the study. Such changes include the testing and possible adoption of a revised risk modeling theory, potential collection and dissemination of additional carrier data and revised measures for intervention thresholds. The adoption of such changes is contingent on the results of the new modeling theory and additional public feedback.
It is unclear if, when, and to what extent any such changes will occur. However, any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
CSA scores do not currently have a direct impact on a carrier's safety rating.  However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may affect driving associate recruiting and retention by causing qualified driving associates to seek employment with other carriers, cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with more favorable scores, subjecting us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
Safety Fitness Determination — In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("NPRM") in the Federal Register, regarding carrier safety fitness determination. The NPRM proposed new methodologies that would have determined when a motor carrier was not fit to operate a commercial motor vehicle. Key proposed changes that were included in the NPRM are as follows:

• | There would be only one safety rating of "unfit," as compared to the current rules, which have three safety ratings (satisfactory, conditional, and unsatisfactory).


• | Carriers could be determined "unfit" by failing two or more BASICs, investigation results, or a combination of the two.


• | Stricter standards would be used for BASICs with a higher correlation to crash risk (Unsafe Driving and Hours-of-Service Compliance).


• | All investigation results would be used, not just results from comprehensive on-site reviews.


• | Violations of a revised list of "critical" and "acute" safety regulations would result in failing a BASIC.


• | Carriers would be assessed monthly.

Public comments on the proposed rule were due in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the FAST Act and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the CSA scoring system. Based on this feedback and other concerns raised by industry stakeholders, in March 2017, the FMCSA withdrew the NPRM related to the new safety rating system. In its notice of withdrawal, the FMCSA noted that a new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form any such rule could be implemented.

Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Bill
In July 2012, Congress passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century bill into law. Included in the highway bill was a provision that mandates electronic logging devices in commercial motor vehicles to record hours-of-service. Additionally, in response to the bill, a final rule related to entry-level driver training was passed in 2016, as well as amendments to the Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse rules.
ELD — During 2012, the FMCSA published a Supplemental NPRM, announcing its plan to proceed with the ELDs and hours-of-service supporting documents rulemaking. The ELD rule became final in December 2015, as published in the Federal Register, with an effective date of February 16, 2016. The ELD rule phases in over a four-year period: 

• | Phase 1 (February 16, 2016 through December 18, 2017): Carriers and drivers subject to the rule may voluntarily use ELDs or use other forms of logging devices.


• | Phase 2 (December 18, 2017 through December 16, 2019): Carriers and drivers subject to the rule can use Automatic On-board Recording Devices that were installed prior to December 18, 2017 or ELDs certified and registered after December 16, 2015.


• | Phase 3 (after December 16, 2019): All drivers and carriers subject to the rule must use certified and registered ELDs that comply with the requirements of the ELD regulations.

Although the final ELD rule may have caused many carriers to experience at least a short-term drop in production and has had a significant impact on the industry as a whole, we have not experienced any adverse effects, as we had installed ELDs in our operational trucks well before the December 2017 compliance date in conjunction with our efforts to improve efficiency and communications with driving associates and independent contractors. However, we believe that more effective hours-of-service enforcement under the ELD rule may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to hours-of-service requirements.
Entry-Level Driver Training — In December 2016, the FMCSA established new minimum training standards for certain individuals applying for (or upgrading) a Class A or Class B commercial driver's license, or obtaining a hazardous materials, passenger, or school bus endorsement on their commercial driver's license for the first time. Such individuals are subject to the entry-level driver training requirements and must complete a prescribed program of theory and behind-the-wheel instruction. The final rule requires that behind-the-wheel proficiency of an entry-level truck driver be determined solely by the instructor's evaluation of how well the driver-trainee performs the fundamental vehicle controls skills and driving procedures set forth in the curricula, but does not have a minimum training hours requirement, as proposed by the FMCSA earlier in 2016. The final rule went into effect on February 6, 2017, with a compliance date of February 7, 2020. Upon the compliance date, training schools will be required to register with the FMCSA's Training Provider Registry and certify that their program meets the classroom and driving standards. We will also be required to comply with this rule in the course of operating our driving schools. The effect of this rule could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations.
Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse — In December 2016, the FMCSA amended the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to establish requirements of the Commercial Driver's License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse, a database under its administration that will contain information about violations of the FMCSA's drug and alcohol testing program for holders of commercial driver's licenses. In addition to requiring employers to check the database for driver applicant drug and alcohol test failures, the final rule requires employers to check the database to determine whether current employees have incurred a drug or alcohol violation that would prohibit them from performing safety-sensitive functions. The final rule became effective on January 4, 2017, with a compliance date of January 6, 2020. Upon implementation, the rule may reduce the number of available drivers in an already constrained driver market.
Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers
In November 2015, the Prohibiting Coercion of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers rule became final. The rule explicitly prohibits motor carriers from coercing drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations, including driver hours-of-service limits, Commercial Drivers' License regulations, drug and alcohol testing rules, and hazardous materials regulations, among others. Under the rule, drivers can report incidents of coercion to the FMCSA, who is authorized to issue penalties against the motor carrier. We have not experienced any significant impacts from this rule.

Speed Limiting Devices
In September 2016, the NHTSA and FMCSA proposed regulations that would require speed limiting devices on vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 26,000 pounds for the service life of the vehicle. The speed was expected to be limited to 62, 65, or 68, but ultimately would have been set by the final rule. Based on the agencies' review of the available data, limiting the speed of these heavy vehicles would reduce the severity of crashes involving these vehicles and reduce the resulting injuries and fatalities. Public comments on the proposed rule were due in November 2016, and in July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. The effect of this rule, to the extent it became effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations.
For safety, we electronically govern the speed of substantially all of our company tractors. Additionally, our independent contractor agreements include statements that independent contractors must comply with the Company's speed policy.
Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 ("FSMA")
In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the FSMA.  This rule sets forth requirements related to:

• | the design and maintenance of equipment used to transport food,


• | the measures taken during food transportation to ensure food safety,


• | the training of carrier personnel in sanitary food transportation practices, and


• | maintenance and retention of records of written procedures, agreements, and training related to the foregoing items.

These requirements took effect for larger carriers such as us in April 2017 and are also applicable when we perform as a carrier or as a broker. We believe we have been in compliance with these requirement since that time. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA, we could be subject to substantial fines, penalties and/or criminal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Legislation Regarding Independent Contractors
Tax and other regulatory authorities have sought in the past to assert that independent contractors in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors.  Federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are found to have violated employees' overtime or wage requirements.  Additionally, federal legislators have sought to:

• | abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice,


• | extend the FLSA to independent contractors, and


• | impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply.

Some states have adopted initiatives to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and we believe a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative.  Federal and state taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. 
Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against us and other members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. Our defense of such class actions and other lawsuits has not always been successful, and we have been subject to adverse judgments with respect to such matters. In addition, carriers such as us that operate or have operated lease-purchase programs have been more susceptible to lawsuits seeking to reclassify independent contractors that have engaged in such programs.  If our independent contractors were determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.  We currently observe and monitor our compliance with current related and applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict whether future laws and regulations, judicial decisions, or settlements regarding the classification of independent contractors will adversely affect our business or operations.

State Wage and Hour Legislation
In March 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that California state wage and hour laws are not preempted by federal law. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which denied certiorari in May 2015, and accordingly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision stood. However, in December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the American Trucking Associations and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California’s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA’s decision has been appealed by labor groups and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision, and thus it’s uncertain whether it will stand. Other current and future state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. As a result, we are subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the US. In the past, certain legislators have proposed federal legislation to preempt state and local wage and hour laws; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire fleet, or revise our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, increased driver turnover, and decreased efficiency.

Other Regulation

Executive Order
The regulatory environment has changed under the administration of President Trump.  In January 2017, the President signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one they propose and imposing a regulatory budget, which would limit the amount of new regulatory costs federal agencies can impose on individuals and businesses each year.  We do not believe the order has had a significant impact on our industry. However, the order, and other anti-regulatory action by the President and/or Congress, may inhibit future new regulations and/or lead to the repeal or delayed effectiveness of existing regulations. Therefore, it is uncertain how we may be impacted in the future by existing, proposed, or repealed regulations. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, the US enacted significant changes to its tax law following the passage and signing of H.R.1, "An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018" (previously known as "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"). The new tax law is complex and includes various changes which may impact the Company. See Note 15 in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details, including the financial impact on the Company.
