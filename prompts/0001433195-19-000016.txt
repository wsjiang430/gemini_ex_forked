ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless otherwise stated in this Annual Report, references to "AppFolio," "we," "us," and "our" refer to AppFolio, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
Our mission is to revolutionize vertical industry businesses by providing great software and services. To that end, today we offer industry-specific, cloud-based business software solutions, services and data analytics to the real estate market, which comprises a significant majority of our revenue, and, to a lesser extent, to the legal market. Our real estate software solutions provide our property manager customers with a system of record to automate essential business processes, a system of engagement to enhance business interactions between our customers and their clients and other stakeholders, and a system of intelligence designed to leverage data to predict and optimize business workflows in order to enable superior customer experiences and increase efficiency across our customers' businesses. Our mobile-optimized software solutions are designed for use across multiple devices and operating systems. Our software solutions are all operated as a service for our customers and hosted using a modern cloud-based architecture. This architecture leads to rich data sets that have a consistent schema across our customer base and enables us to deploy data-powered products and services for our customers. We also provide software solutions to the legal market that enable law firms to administer their practice and manage their caseloads more efficiently by centralizing case details in a single system of record and system of engagement. 
Many companies face a common set of challenges that divert limited time and resources away from serving their clients and growing their businesses. In certain industries, day-to-day operations may be managed through inefficient manual processes and disparate software point solutions. This lack of automation and integrated technology results in a significant administrative burden on these businesses, particularly in industries that involve unique workflows, relationships among multiple industry participants, significant data inputs and management, and compliance or regulatory requirements. While larger enterprises and consumers have been experiencing a transformational shift into the digital age, the legacy systems and manual business processes currently used by many other businesses are lagging behind in terms of technological sophistication and ease of use. 
We were formed in 2006 with a vision to revolutionize the way that small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, grow and compete by enabling their digital transformation. In 2008, we entered the real estate market with our first product, AppFolio Property Manager, or APM, a property management solution designed to address the unique operational and business requirements of property management companies. Recognizing that our customers and their stakeholders would benefit from additional business critical services, we launched a series of Value+ services beginning in 2009. Our first Value+ service assisted our customers in the marketing of their rental properties by offering property level website design and hosting services. In 2010, we commenced the roll out of our electronic payment services, thereby facilitating the payment of rent via ACH by tenants. In 2011, we launched tenant screening services, further assisting our customers with the leasing process. In 2012, we introduced our legal liability to landlord insurance program, which protects property owners and managers from certain defined losses. In 2013, we expanded our electronic payment services by allowing residents to pay rent by Electronic Cash Payment and credit or debit card. In 2014, we launched a tenant-facing contact center solution to assist our property managers with resolving incoming maintenance requests. In 2015, with the acquisition of RentLinx, we expanded the marketing services offered to our property manager customers with a premium leads service and expanded our electronic payment services to facilitate payments made between our customers and property owners and vendors. In 2016, we introduced a tenant debt collection Value+ service to assist our property managers with running a more efficient business. In 2017, we expanded our insurance services to enable tenants to purchase renters insurance from within APM, protecting both our property manager customers and their tenants. In 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of WegoWise, Inc., or WegoWise, and expect that this acquisition will serve as a building block for a future utility analytics and management Value+ service. In 2018, we also released AppFolio Property Manager PLUS, or APM PLUS, a new tier of APM designed for larger businesses with more complex needs. APM PLUS builds upon the functionality of APM and additionally offers data analytics, configurable workflows, and revenue management and optimization functionality for our customers. In early 2019, we acquired Dynasty Marketplace, Inc., or Dynasty, and expect the team and technology related to this acquisition, combined with our internal resources, technology and data, to serve as a foundation for future artificial-intelligence, or AI, software and services for the real estate market.
We entered the legal market with the acquisition of MyCase in 2012. In 2013, we introduced website design and hosting services, our first Value+ service for our legal market customers, designed to assist smaller law firms and solo practitioners with the marketing of their practices, electronic storage of case information and communications. In 2016, we launched electronic payments services for the legal market, which streamlined the billing and receivables process through MyCase.

We sell our software solutions and services through our direct sales organization and from within our software applications. We offer our core solutions to customers on a subscription basis, with subscription fees that scale to the size and type of their businesses. Customers who adopt our Value+ services pay either subscription fees or usage-based fees, depending on the Value+ service. We do not separately charge customers for ongoing training and support, which we believe is critical to retaining customers and increasing adoption and utilization of our Value+ services. We also charge one-time fees in connection with certain services. 
We evaluate the success of our business during the periods presented based on factors such as the development and launch of new and innovative core functionality and Value+ services, enhancements to user experience, customer satisfaction, growth in our revenue and customer base, fluctuations in costs and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, operating loss or income and cash flows from operating activities. We have managed, and plan to continue to manage, our business towards the achievement of long-term growth that we believe will positively impact long-term stockholder value, and not towards the realization of short-term financial or business metrics, or short-term stockholder value. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, heavily in our business to capitalize on our market opportunity.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our revenue was $190.1 million, $143.8 million and $105.6 million, respectively. During each of these years we have derived more than 90% of our revenue from our solutions serving the real estate market. Our revenue has limited seasonality as discussed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report, within the section entitled "Quarterly Revenue and Cost Trends." 
Our Solutions 
Although specific functionality varies by product, our core solutions address common business operations and interactions of businesses in our targeted verticals by providing key functionality, including accounting, document management, real-time interactive search, data analytics and communication options. In addition to our core solutions, we offer a range of optional, but often business-critical, Value+ services. Our Value+ services are available on an as-needed basis and enable our customers to adapt our platform to their specific operational requirements.

We offer two insurance options, Liability to Landlord Insurance and Renters Insurance, that can be tailored to help property managers protect their properties and meet renters’ needs. Property managers can instantly enroll residents in Liability to Landlord Insurance, which offers owners and investors increased protection against tenant-caused damage. Renters have the option of purchasing renters insurance through an online portal to protect their personal belongings, as well as the property itself, from certain unexpected damages.
Our Maintenance Contact Center is built into our customers APM maintenance workflow and is staffed 24/7/365 by trained agents, each acting as an extension of our property manager customers’ teams to resolve or route incoming maintenance requests. Contact center agents are able to enter non-emergency work orders directly into APM’s property maintenance software for a property manager’s approval, and to dispatch vendors immediately in case of an emergency.
Premium Leads allow customers to upgrade property listings to premium status and syndicate them to dozens of pay-to-list websites, including featured placement on many sites. Customers also receive advance call tracking and pay only for the verified leads they receive through the Value+ service.

With Tenant Debt Collections, our customers can electronically send past due tenant debt from their APM database to a national fully-licensed third party debt collection agency to recover uncollected revenue. This Value+ service also includes reporting unpaid balances to three major credit bureaus.

With the acquisitions of WeGoWise in September 2018 and Dynasty in January 2019, we expect to extend our Value+ offerings to the real estate market in the future to include a Utility Management Platform and an Artificial Intelligence Leasing Service for hire.
MyCase - Core Solution 
Our legal software solution, MyCase, enables small law firms to more efficiently administer their practice and manage their caseload. MyCase is continuously evolving to help our customers more effectively market, manage and grow their businesses, and contains core functionality that addresses key operational issues, including managing calendars, contacts and documents, time tracking, billing and collections, communicating with clients and sharing sensitive and privileged materials.
MyCase - Value+ Services
In addition to our core solution for MyCase, we offer the following optional Value+ services to our legal customers.
We deliver and maintain professionally designed and architected Websites that practitioners and their clients can utilize to access case and matter information, communicate internally and externally, and manage bills. Our websites are fully-integrated with the MyCase platform and designed to improve the effectiveness of law firm marketing, streamline daily business tasks, and increase mobile presence.

Our real estate customers include third-party property managers, owner-operators and real estate investors who manage single- and multi-family residences, community associations, commercial properties, and student housing, as well as mixed real estate portfolios. As of December 31, 2018, we also had 10,279 small law firms as legal customers that directly and indirectly account for less than 10% of our annual revenue. 
We define our customer base as the number of customers subscribing to our core solutions, exclusive of free trial periods with respect to MyCase. No individual customer represented 10% or more of our total revenue for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

Our Culture and Employees 
We believe our people are at the heart of our success and our customers’ success, and have worked hard not only to attract and hire quality individuals but also to nurture and develop our valuable human resources. We believe in the strong team we have cultivated, particularly in our deep bench of leaders who continue to execute our strategic plans and encourage innovation across the organization. We further believe that our company culture, driven by a dedication to the following six core values, provides us with a significant competitive advantage: 

▪ | Simpler Is Better


▪ | Great, Innovative Products Are Key To A Great Business


▪ | Great People Make A Great Company


▪ | Listening To Customers Is In Our DNA


▪ | Small, Focused Teams Keep Us Agile


▪ | We Do The Right Thing Because It’s Good For Business

At December 31, 2018, we had 916 employees, and we consider our relationship with them to be very good. We also hire temporary employees and consultants, and feel similarly about our relationships with them. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Our Growth Strategy
We have managed, and plan to continue to manage, our business towards the achievement of long-term growth that we believe will positively impact long-term stockholder value, rather than the realization of short-term financial or business metrics, or short-term stockholder value. Our growth strategy is to provide increasingly valuable cloud-based and artificial-intelligence business management software solutions, services and analytics to our customers and their key stakeholders. Key components of our growth strategy include:
Maintain Product and Technology Leadership. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and new product development to expand our software solutions, services and data analytics capabilities as we deem appropriate in our target markets. We intend to continue using our market validation techniques and close relationships with our customers as a key source of feedback to inform and direct our product roadmap. We may also choose to acquire rather than build certain technology solutions to serve our existing or prospective customers. 
Keep Our Existing Customers Happy. Customer success is essential to our long-term success. We place significant emphasis on customer service to differentiate our software solutions from competing products and this will continue to be a critical component of our business strategy in the future. We believe that maintaining our focus on customer satisfaction will drive greater adoption and utilization of our software solutions over time. 
Expand Adoption and Use By Existing Customers. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments that expand our core functionality and add new Value+ services to meet the evolving needs and requirements of our customers and their key stakeholders. We expect our customers will continue to use our technology to manage their businesses and increasingly adopt and use additional Value+ services. 
Acquire New Customers. We plan to grow our customer base with our sales and marketing programs, including evolving industry thought leadership and education, and the referral power of satisfied customers. 
Enter New Adjacent Markets. We continue to evaluate and expand into adjacent markets based on our market validation strategy and customer feedback. We firmly believe that, while we are continuously developing our software solutions within one market, we can apply certain relevant product enhancements and learnings from that market as we extend our platform into each successive adjacent market. 
Expand into New Verticals. We continue to review potential opportunities to expand into additional vertical markets. Any new vertical also must fit within our overall business strategy, including our management team's assessment of available alternatives, such as the number and size of potential adjacent market opportunities, and the relative risk and return of these opportunities. 
Sales and Marketing
5

We leverage a modern marketing approach along with marketing automation technology to build brand recognition and our reputation as an industry leader in our targeted markets.
We participate in and drive industry thought leadership and education with both online and offline activities, and use a variety of marketing techniques to promote our software solutions. Our sales development team acts in partnership with our marketing organization to reach potential customers, generate additional sales opportunities and speed the time from evaluation to close. Our real estate sales representatives assist prospective customers as they evaluate our software solutions. Prospective law firm customers either sign up for a free trial on a self-service basis or speak to our sales development representatives as they evaluate our software solutions.
Our interactive sales methodology allows our sales team to quickly build relationships, assess our customers’ business challenges, and demonstrate the benefits of our core functionality and Value+ services. Throughout the customer relationship, we continue to promote adoption and usage of our Value+ services through a variety of channels, including email, webinars, training, sales outreach and from within our software solution via in-app messaging.
Customer Service
Our success is based on long-term customer retention, not a one-time sale, and we partner with our customers throughout the life of our relationship. We design our software solutions to be simple and easy to implement, use and manage, and offer unlimited training and support at no extra charge. We pride ourselves on being customer-centric and strive to educate our customers on the additional core functionality and Value+ services they can use to improve business efficiency and productivity.
Our onboarding team strives to ensure that customers are prepared to run their businesses on our platform and provide a seamless onboarding experience. As a result of our assistance with data migration matters, we are able to provide valuable insights into data integrity and work diligently with our customers to help resolve any issues in their underlying business processes. We also assist our customers with the configuration of our platform for particular property types or cases, as appropriate. We provide a dedicated team throughout the onboarding process and beyond, and share insights on best practices in both of our targeted verticals. In addition, certain members of our Value+ teams are focused on guiding our customers through the adoption and utilization of our Value+ services.
Technology and Operations
Data Security and Availability
We use Ruby-on-Rails as our web application framework for both APM and MyCase. We take great care to keep these application frameworks current in order to mitigate known web application security vulnerabilities. Our software solutions run on a combination of both public and private cloud infrastructure across four distinct geographic U.S. regions, consisting of both our own servers and Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud platform. Our servers are located in state-of-the-art data centers operated by third-party service providers. Physical security at these facilities includes a variety of access controls, including electronic keycards, pin codes, biometric hand scans and mantraps, and policing by high resolution, motion sensitive video surveillance. These facilities provide redundant power and a system of heating, ventilating and air conditioning, as well as fire-threat detection and suppression. Upon arriving in one of our data centers, customer data is immediately replicated to a datacenter in at least one other geographic region, in order to ensure that no data is ever lost and that customer requests can always be satisfied. In addition to hot standby databases, we regularly back up all customer data to Amazon Simple Storage Service. 
Our operators monitor our systems to ensure high performance and availability and our architecture allows our operators significant flexibility in achieving these goals. In particular, our operators have fine-grained control over which data center each customer’s data resides, and can easily move customer data between four geographic regions in order to avoid service disruption or to increase service performance.
All sensitive customer data is encrypted during transmission and before being written to disk, including passwords, Social Security and tax identification numbers. We regularly evaluate our Internet security, including through third-party penetration testing. In addition, our software solutions allow our customers to define roles that provide different levels of access to users, allowing them to view and modify specific items depending on their role. Supervisors can distribute work to on-site staff in a secure and controlled environment, while leadership retains visibility across the entire system.    
Research and Product Development
6

We entrust product design, development and testing to our team of engineers, who coordinate closely with our product management team to launch new core functionality, products and Value+ services. Our engineers are organized in smaller groups to foster agility and continued innovation in responding to the evolving needs of our customers. We leverage a collaborative, team-based and test-driven approach to engineering in order to release new code frequently. We believe that it is easier for our customers to adjust to continuous updates to our software solutions, which incrementally change and improve their user experience, than it is to adapt to infrequent, but more drastic upgrades of legacy on-premise software.
We rely heavily on input from our customers in developing products that meet their needs and in anticipating developments in their respective industries. Our product management team leads our research and market validation efforts and provides guidance to management and our engineering team based on our collective domain expertise and in-depth knowledge and understanding of our customers. As a result, our product management team engages regularly with customers, partners and other industry participants, as well as our customer service and sales and marketing organizations. Our product management team manages our development projects generally and serves to align separate functions within the company with a single strategic vision.
Competition 
The overall market for business management software is global, highly competitive and continually evolving in response to changes in technology, operational requirements, laws and regulations. We believe our competitors fall into the following primary categories: 

• | On-premise or cloud-based vertical market business management software providers that serve companies of all sizes in our markets; and


• | On-premise or cloud-based horizontal business management software providers that offer broad solutions across multiple verticals.

We also see competition from numerous cloud-based solutions providers that focus almost exclusively on one or more point solutions. For example, in the real estate vertical, we compete with listing services, tenant screening applications and specialists in lease forms. In the legal vertical, we compete with time tracking, legal billing and payment services. Continued consolidation among cloud-based solution providers could lead to significantly increased competition. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in each of our vertical markets include the following: 
▪ease of deployment and use of software solutions and applications; 
▪total cost of ownership; 
▪data security and availability; 
▪breadth and depth of functionality in software solutions and applications; 
▪nature and extent of mobile interface; 
▪level of customer satisfaction; 
▪size of customer base and level of user adoption and usage; 
▪brand awareness and reputation; 
▪ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; 
▪ domain expertise with respect to our targeted verticals; and 
▪ability to leverage a common technology platform and business strategy. 
We believe that we compete favorably on the factors described above. However, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition and larger sales and marketing budgets; therefore, we may not always compare favorably with respect to some or all of the foregoing factors. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our core solutions and Value+ services. At January 31, 2019, we had twelve issued United States patents that directly relate to our technology and expire between 2026 and 2033. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. 
7

We have registered “AppFolio” and "MyCase" and certain other marks as trademarks in the United States and several other jurisdictions. We have also acquired certain marks and filed trademark applications and renewals in the United States and certain other jurisdictions, and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “appfolioinc.com,” “appfolio.com,” “mycase.com” and similar variations. We also license software from third parties for use in our solutions, including open source software and other software available on standard commercial terms. 
We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our software solutions and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. 
Seasonality
We experience limited seasonality in our Value+ services revenue, primarily with respect to certain leasing-related services we provide to our property manager customers, including our tenant application and tenant screening services. These customers historically have processed fewer applications for new tenants during the winter holiday season; therefore, revenue associated with our leasing services typically declines in the fourth quarter. As a result of this seasonal decline in revenue, we have typically experienced slower sequential revenue growth or a sequential decline in revenue in the fourth quarter of each of our most recent fiscal years. We expect this seasonality to continue in the foreseeable future.
