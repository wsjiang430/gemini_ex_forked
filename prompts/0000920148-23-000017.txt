Enterprise Strategy
The Company provides vital information to help its customers make clear and confident health decisions. Through its science, data, and global laboratory network, the Company accelerates and advances innovations in testing and treatments to improve patient care.
The Company is expanding its role in the rapidly evolving healthcare market by strengthening its positions across its portfolio of capabilities, growing strategic opportunities that drive new business, and differentiating its unique offerings, capabilities, and financial performance. To do so, the Company is focusing on executing the following strategic priorities, which have evolved to reflect its operations and strategic vision:
1.Build on the Company's Leadership in Oncology
The field of oncology receives significant investment in research, development, and treatment, yet it remains an area of great unmet medical need. The Company believes the diagnosis and treatment of cancer will be the fastest-growing therapeutic area in the near future.
Index

With the increased adoption of precision medicine, health and cancer care providers are relying on advanced testing to identify patients who will benefit from new, targeted treatments and therapies that are more effective and often have fewer side effects than chemotherapy and other traditional treatments. Since forming an oncology business unit and launching an enterprise oncology platform in 2021, the Company has become an oncology leader. By focusing its diagnostic and drug development services on the fight against cancer, the Company is delivering targeted solutions that power better decision and improved patient outcomes. The Company believes it maintains the broadest portfolio and capabilities in oncology diagnostics today. The Company intends to accelerate its leadership and enhance its offerings, particularly in genomic testing, personalized medicine and liquid biopsy. The Company is also leveraging its oncological capabilities and platforms to progress its work in other areas, including neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune and liver diseases, and cell and gene therapy. 
In 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Personal Genome Diagnostics (PGDx), a provider of comprehensive liquid biopsy and tissue-based genomic products and services. The acquisition of PGDx enhances the Company's precision diagnostic portfolio and its ability to increase access to oncology care globally. In addition, the Company continues to realize benefits from its portfolio of OmniSeq products such as OmniSeq INSIGHT, a comprehensive genomic and immune profiling, tissue-based test that integrates next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. 
2. Differentiate Through Digital and Data 
The healthcare and life sciences industries remain among the most significantly impacted by technological advancements. By maximizing the use of advances in artificial intelligence (AI), data, digitalization, and analytics in compliance with applicable regulations, the Company strives to improve operating efficiency and business performance, and to create new, differentiated products and services that the Company believes will help its customers and deliver better care to patients.
The Company is using AI to better identify and predict trends such as the timing and location of demand shifts for certain tests. In doing so, the Company is supporting an efficient use of supplies, staffing, and the Company’s advanced logistics used to route testing to the most appropriate laboratories and quickly deliver results. AI capabilities and advanced logistics have played, and are expected to continuing playing, an important role in the Company’s response to periods of heightened demand for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. 
The Company creates, and has access to, significant volumes of data. By applying advanced analytics to its data in compliance with data privacy regulations, the Company can help its customers improve their processes and reach better outcomes. The Company’s repository of test results help study sponsors assess patients' eligibility for clinical trials more quickly and accurately, enroll those patients faster, shorten the time needed for regulatory submission, and accelerate the availability of new medicines. Data is also being used by the Company to advance science and the public's understanding of certain treatments and illnesses.
Digitalization continues to be an area of focus for the Company as it responds to the use of technology-enabled tools and services by healthcare providers, patients and pharmaceutical companies for absorbing, handling, and disseminating information. These services include decentralized clinical trials, which offer the potential to remove barriers that may have slowed or prevented studies from being conducted in the past. Decentralized clinical trials can also make trial participation an option for more people, including individuals from underrepresented populations. 
In the U.S., the Company continues to improve its patients' experience in patient service centers (PSCs) by creating a seamless digital journey from appointment scheduling to results delivery. With an average of 3 million patients served in a given week, the Company strives to enhance their experience using its digital channels. 
3. Drive Customer Centricity
The Company serves a broad range of customers, including managed care organizations (MCOs), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and diagnostics companies, governmental agencies, physicians and other healthcare providers, hospitals and health systems, employers, patients and consumers, CROs, and independent clinical laboratories. The Company continues to focus on its customers, anticipate their needs, and deliver valuable solutions that help them achieve their goals. 
The Company prioritizes a consistent, coordinated focus across all aspects of its operations, placing the customer at the center of its services, with the objective of becoming the customer's primary partner for solutions to their needs. In an effort to provide a leading customer experience, the Company seeks customer feedback, communicates best practices and lessons learned, and provides robust employee training with respect to the needs of its customers.
The Company routinely introduces new products, services, and initiatives that benefit its customers. For example, the Company launched a new test in mid-2022 to assist in the identification and confirmation of neurodegenerative disease and neuronal injury. The Company also expanded access to its services in the Midwestern U.S. with the opening of a new laboratory, and it announced plans to expand its laboratory footprint in Japan. In addition, the Company continues to experience 
Index

growing demand for its consumer-initiated wellness testing available through Labcorp OnDemand, and it believes its pipeline of innovative, consumer-focused offerings is strong. 
4. Expand Globally
The Company has a long history of disciplined use of capital to invest in the growth of the business and intends to grow its business globally by leveraging its advanced laboratory network, scientific capabilities, health data and insights, and its results-oriented culture to achieve better health for all people. 
The Company has made significant investments in the deployment of new technologies through both licensing and internal research and development, as well as strategic and tuck-in acquisitions. The Company has also invested in establishing collaborative partnerships with other leading companies and organizations that share the Company’s goals and expectations. 
The Company continually evaluates its business and the broader healthcare and life sciences markets to proactively identify and assess:
•potential growth opportunities; 
•business areas that might not support continued growth and should be revamped or divested; 
•acquisition targets that meet its criteria for quality, value, and return on investment; 
•new products that would successfully integrate with or extend the Company’s offerings; and
•a balanced formula for capital allocation. 
Through a continued focus on these strategic priorities, reinforced through the Company's capital allocation plan, the Company expects to be in an optimal position to make disciplined choices that maximize shareholder value, better protect the Company from market fluctuations and outside impacts, and fuel significant and profitable short- and long-term revenue growth. 
COVID-19 Pandemic Response
The Company has supported the fight against COVID-19 since the earliest stages of the pandemic, and it continues to play an important role in ongoing response efforts. 
In 2022, the Company further expanded access to COVID-19 testing and continued to support the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies.
The Company received FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for multiple innovations during the year. In June, the Company was granted FDA EUA for its next-generation sequencing test used to identify specific SARS-CoV-2 lineages. This was the first test authorized for the identification and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (PANGO) lineages, which are genetic variations in circulating virus strains. The Company also received FDA EUA for the first non-prescription, at-home collection kit for combined COVID-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection. These achievements built on the Company's first COVID-19-related FDA EUA, which was received on March 16, 2020, for COVID-19 PCR testing, the FDA EUA in April 2020 for the Pixel by Labcorp® COVID-19 test home collection kit, and in December 2020 for over-the-counter purchase of these home collection kits. 
The Company's additional contributions to the pandemic response in 2022 included assisting in the identification and monitoring of COVID-19 variants and spikes in confirmed cases, as well as expanding no-cost access to at-home test collections for individuals who met clinical guidelines. The Company maintained its ability to quickly scale up COVID-19 PCR testing capacity throughout the year, even during periods of reduced demand. In doing so, the Company was able to immediately and effectively respond to surges in positive cases and testing needs. The Company performed approximately 13 million COVID-19 PCR tests and 1 million antibody tests in 2022, and since the start of the pandemic has performed approximately 74 million COVID-19 PCR tests and 9 million antibody tests.
COVID-19 Outlook
COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a substantial impact on the global health and economic environments. The Company continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business, given continued unpredictability, corresponding state, local and federal government restrictions and policies, the continued emergence of new variants that may cause increases in cases that may impact the Company, and the potential for shifts in customer behavior.
While the Company anticipates that COVID-19 will continue impacting its business in 2023 and potentially beyond, the Company expects a continued decline in demand for COVID-19 Testing, with the potential for increases in demand at different times and across different geographies. As a result, COVID-19 Testing demand in 2023 is not predicted to match 2022 levels.
Index

Capital Allocation
The Company believes it has a strong track record of deploying capital to investments that enhance the Company's business and return capital to shareholders. 
During 2022, the Company invested $1,164.0 million in strategic business acquisitions. The acquisitions have expanded the Company’s service offerings, expanded its customer and revenue mix, and strengthened and broadened the scope of its geographic presence. The Company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities that leverage the Company’s core competencies, complement existing scientific and technological capabilities, increase the Company’s presence in key geographic, therapeutic and strategic areas, and meet or exceed the Company’s financial criteria. 
During 2022, the Company repurchased 5.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $233.48 for a total cost of $1,100.0 million. This included 0.9 million shares which were repurchased in 2022 but were part of the $1,000.0 million Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) Program paid for in 2021. At the end of 2022, the Company had outstanding authorization from the Board to purchase $531.5 of Company common stock. On February 7, 2023, the board of directors adopted a new share repurchase plan authorizing up to $1,000.0 of the Company's shares in addition to the remaining amount outstanding under the previous plan. The repurchase authorization has no expiration. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.
During 2022, capital expenditures were $481.9 million. The Company expects capital expenditures in 2023 to be approximately 3.5% of revenues, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the Company's core businesses, facility expansion and updates, projects related to its LaunchPad initiative, and further acquisition integration initiatives. 
The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities for strategic deployment of capital in light of market conditions.
Seasonality and External Factors
The Company experiences seasonality across its business. For example, testing volume generally declines during the year-end holiday period and other major holidays and can also decline due to inclement weather or natural disasters. Declines in testing volume reduce revenues, operating margins and cash flows. Operations are also impacted by changes in the global economy, exchange rate fluctuations, political and regulatory changes, the progress of ongoing studies and the startup of new studies, as well as the level of expenditures made by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries in R&D. As discussed in more detail elsewhere in Item 1, COVID-19 impacted the Company in 2022. This impact included the effect of the Company’s response to the virus through its testing and drug development services, as well as the effect of COVID-19 on the global economy and demand for the Company’s non-COVID-19 services.
In 2022, approximately 14.7% of the Company's revenues were billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with the Swiss franc, British pound, Canadian dollar, and the euro representing the largest components of its currency exposure. 
Given the seasonality and changing economic factors impacting the business, comparison of the results for successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year.

The Company reports its business in two segments, Dx and DD. In 2022, Dx and DD contributed 61% and 39%, respectively, of revenues to the Company, and in 2021 contributed 64% and 36%, respectively. Nearly all of Dx’s revenues are generated in the U.S., with a smaller portion in Canada and a relatively small amount in the rest of the world. DD’s revenues are nearly evenly split between the U.S. and the rest of the world, with approximately 48% derived from the U.S. and approximately 52% from other countries. Although this allocation of revenues provides some protection from economic shifts in any one country, it is still heavily tilted towards the U.S. As a result, the Company continues to actively explore new and expanded business opportunities outside the U.S. to further diversify its sources of revenues. The Company's revenues by segment payers/customer groups and by geography for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

Effect of U.S. Market Changes on the Clinical Laboratory Business
The delivery of, and reimbursement for, healthcare continues to change in the U.S., impacting all stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory business. Medicare (which principally serves patients who are 65 and older), Medicaid (which principally serves low-income patients) and insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. Measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular have resulted in reduced prices, added costs, increased coverage denials and claims edits, and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by imposing new, increasingly complex regulatory and administrative requirements. The government also has continued to adjust the Medicare and Medicaid fee schedules at the national and local level, and the Company believes that pressure to reduce government reimbursement will continue.
Fees for most laboratory services reimbursed by Medicare are established in the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) and fees for other testing reimbursed by Medicare, primarily related to pathology, are covered by the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). During 2022, approximately 8.9% of Dx’s revenue was reimbursed under the CLFS (8.5% in 2021), and approximately 0.4% was reimbursed under the PFS (0.4% in 2021). Dx has experienced governmental reimbursement reductions as a direct result of several Congressional acts and regulatory initiatives. These laws include provisions designed to control healthcare expenses reimbursed by government programs through a combination of reductions to fee schedules, incentives to physicians to participate in alternative payment models such as risk-sharing, and new methods to establish and adjust fees.
The most significant of these developments was the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA), which became law on April 1, 2014, and which went into effect on January 1, 2018. Beginning in 2018, under PAMA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) set the CLFS using the weighted median of reported private payer prices paid to certain laboratories that receive a majority of their Medicare revenue from the CLFS and PFS and that bill Medicare under their own National Provider Identifier (NPI). Applicable labs, including Dx, were required to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to CMS during the first quarter of 2017. CMS used that private market data to calculate weighted median prices for each test (based on applicable current procedural technology (CPT) codes) to represent the new CLFS rates beginning in 2018, subject to certain phase-in limits. For 2018 through 2020, a test price could not be reduced by more than 10.0% per year. PAMA resulted in a net reduction in reimbursement revenue of approximately $245.0 million between 2018-2020 from all payers affected by the CLFS.
Due to enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) passed by Congress on March 27, 2020, the Medicare reimbursement cuts that would have occurred under PAMA in 2021 were delayed by one year. In 2021, Dx realized an increase of approximately $0.3 million in PFS revenue as a result of the provisions included in the Omnibus Appropriations and Coronavirus Relief Package. In 2021, Dx realized an additional increase of approximately $5.8 million in aggregate Medicare reimbursement associated with the suspension of sequestration through December of 2021, as a result of provisions included in the Omnibus Appropriations and Coronavirus Relief Package that were extended as a result of an Act to Prevent Across-the-Board Direct Spending Cuts.
On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed into law the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which delayed by one additional year the data reporting requirements and Medicare reimbursement cuts that would have occurred under PAMA in 2022, resulting in a 0% update to the CLFS in 2022. In 2022, Dx realized a decrease of approximately $0.4 million in PFS revenue driven by reductions in reimbursement for flow cytometry procedures and a decrease of approximately $10.0 million in aggregate Medicare reimbursement associated with the phased in reinstitution of sequestration as a result of provisions included in the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act. 
The Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act also included mitigations to several other non-PAMA Medicare cuts in addition to delaying Medicare reimbursement cuts under PAMA. It delayed the 4% Medicare cuts that would otherwise have occurred in 2022 under statutory “pay-as-you-go,” or PAYGO, rules to offset the cost of the American Rescue Plan Act by one year. In addition, it delayed the resumption of the 2% Medicare sequestration until April 1, 2022, and reduced to 0.75% the previous 3.75% reduction to PFS reimbursement that was scheduled for 2022. To offset the cost, the Medicare sequestration was increased to 2.25% for January through June of 2030, and to 3.0% for July through December 2030.
On December 29, 2022, President Biden signed into law H.R. 2617, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which delayed by one additional year the data reporting requirements and Medicare reimbursement cuts that would have occurred under PAMA in 2023, resulting in a 0% update to the CLFS for 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 also included mitigations to several other non-PAMA Medicare cuts in addition to delaying Medicare reimbursement cuts under PAMA. It delayed until October 1, 2024 the 4% Medicare cuts that would otherwise have been effective January 1, 2023 under PAYGO rules. In addition, it mitigated PFS cuts in 2023 and 2024 to by 2.5% and 1.25%, respectively, that would otherwise have been (4.47%) in 2023 based on the conversation factor put forward in the 2023 Medicare PFS Final Rule. To offset the 
Index

cost, it extended the 2% Medicare sequestration through the first six months of 2032 and set the sequestration percentage at 2% in fiscal years 2030 and 2031.
In 2023, Dx anticipates a net PFS revenue increase of 0.8% ($0.3 million) from the 2023 PFS Final Rule, driven by a (2.0%) change to the PFS conversion factor that is offset by net positive changes in relative value units (RVUs) for flow cytometry and changes to RVUs for other PFS procedures. The 2023 PFS Final Rule also included an increase in the CLFS fee for specimen collection by venipuncture from $3.00 to $8.57, which is estimated to increase Dx CLFS revenue for specimen collection by $38.6 million in 2023.
Pursuant to PAMA as amended, for 2024 through 2026, a CLFS test price cannot be reduced by more than 15.0% per year (excluding non-PAMA reimbursement changes). CLFS rates for 2027 and subsequent periods will not be subject to phase-in limits. The phase-in of rates for Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (CDLTs) established in 2018 will resume in 2024. New CLFS rates will be established in 2025 based on data from 2019 to be reported in 2024. New CLFS rates will be established in 2028 based on data from 2026 to be reported in 2027. CLFS rates for Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests will be updated annually.
The American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) filed a federal civil action in 2017 challenging the legal basis for the data collection methodology CMS used to derive the data from which the median prices were calculated. On July 15, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of ACLA on the merits, finding that CMS harmed laboratories by collecting data in an arbitrary and capricious manner, but refused to grant relief due to PAMA’s statutory bar on judicial review of establishment of the rates.
Since the initial data collection, CMS has revised its PAMA regulations to increase the number of hospital outreach labs that will be required to report private market data in future collections. Reports by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) on PAMA implementation have identified certain instances of actual or potential increased Medicare expenditures under PAMA, as well as potential alternative methodologies for data collection under PAMA, which could result in further efforts to amend PAMA by Congress.
ACLA has continued to work with Congress on potential legislative reform of PAMA, which if adopted could reduce the negative impact of PAMA as currently implemented by CMS. Under the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries (LAB) Act, MedPAC was required to conduct a study and make recommendations to Congress on ways to improve data collection, reporting, and rate setting under PAMA to achieve, in a less burdensome manner, CLFS rates that accurately and fairly reflect private market rates. MedPAC's June 2021 report to Congress included an analysis of potential statistical sampling methodologies that could accomplish that objective, and ACLA incorporated the concept in PAMA reform proposals to Congress. On June 22, 2022, the Saving Access to Laboratory Services Act (S. 4449 H.R. 8188) was introduced in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives to provide for permanent reform of PAMA incorporating many of ACLA’s proposals. The Company supports the ongoing efforts to prevent or lessen the negative impact of the changes to the CLFS pursuant to PAMA, and the full impact of those efforts, but what the long-term effect will be on the CLFS rates is not yet known.
Further healthcare reform could occur in 2023, including changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare reform, as well as administrative requirements that may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services in ways that are currently unpredictable.
In addition, market-based changes have affected and will continue to affect the clinical laboratory business. Reimbursement from commercial payers for diagnostic testing may shift away from traditional, fee-for-service models to alternatives, including value-based, bundled pay-for-performance, and other risk-sharing payment models. The growth of the managed care sector and consolidation of MCOs present various challenges and opportunities to Dx and other clinical laboratories. Dx's ability to attract and retain MCO customers has become even more important as the impact of various healthcare reform initiatives continues, including expanded health insurance exchanges and ACOs.
The Company serves many MCOs. These organizations have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of their products. Some MCOs contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of rates. Other MCOs adopt broader networks with generally uniform fee structures for participating clinical laboratories. In some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories, while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different, and are typically higher. MCOs may also offer Managed Medicare or Managed Medicaid plans. In addition, some MCOs use capitation rates to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. Under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the clinical laboratory receives a per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of laboratory tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by the clinical laboratory from a capitation pool. When the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of 
Index

testing performed. Under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2022, capitated contracts with MCOs accounted for approximately $332.3 million, or 3.2%, of Dx's revenues.
In addition to reductions in test reimbursement, the Company also anticipates potential declines in test volumes as a result of increased controls over the utilization of laboratory services by Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payers, particularly MCOs. MCOs are implementing, directly or through third parties, various types of laboratory benefit management programs, which may include laboratory networks, utilization management tools (such as prior authorization and/or prior notification), and claims edits, which impact coverage and reimbursement of clinical laboratory tests. Some of these programs address clinical laboratory testing broadly, while others are focused on certain types of testing, including molecular, genetic and toxicology testing. In addition, continued movement by patients into consumer-driven health plans may have an impact on the utilization of laboratory testing. Test volumes in 2023 could also change compared to 2022 and 2021 if demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing changes.
Helping to balance the overall negative market changes regarding reimbursement discussed above, the Company believes that the volume of clinical laboratory testing is positively influenced by several factors, including an increase in the number and types of tests that are readily available (due to advances in technology and increased cost efficiencies) for the diagnosis of disease, and the general aging of the U.S. population. Periodic infectious disease outbreaks such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus also have the potential to generate additional testing volume in the future, and enhance stakeholders’ appreciation for the value of laboratory testing in combating future potential outbreaks. Dx believes that its enhanced and growing esoteric menu of tests, leading position with companion diagnostics, broad geographic footprint, and operating efficiency make it well positioned for growth due to a number of market factors, primarily related to a continued drive to improve outcomes and reduce costs across the healthcare system, including but not limited to greater price transparency required under “surprise billing” laws and regulations requiring disclosure of hospital charges.

The Company has also implemented opportunities for greater engagement between employees and management. These include quarterly global town halls that are held virtually and are open to all employees, interactions with front-line employees on visits to the Company's facilities, and in-person town halls with employees in select business units. In early 2022, the Company initiated a Voice of the Employee Survey. Responses were received from nearly 50% of Company employees across 64 countries. The insights provided by employees are being used to make improvements in the virtual onboarding experience for new employees, introduction of a modern global human resources portal, and a reimagined U.S. benefits portal to help employees to better evaluate their benefits options. 
Compensation
The Company operates in a complex, global, and dynamic life sciences industry and believes that its compensation and benefits programs must continue to be competitive and flexible to attract and retain the caliber of talent needed to sustainably grow the business. In 2022, the Company’s workforce grew by over 10%. The Company believes that its ability to expand the workforce in 2022 provides support that the Company's compensation and benefit strategies are competitive and support the Company's ability to attract and retain talent.
The Company continually monitors market activity and employee movement within and outside of the core life sciences industry to maintain competitiveness, given the dynamic business and economic environment and labor market challenges it faces. In 2022, the Company invested more than $39 million in pay adjustments in addition to annual pay increases, to increase pay competitiveness in the markets in which we compete for talent.
Employee Wellness
The Company also continued investing in the health and wellness of its global workforce, with particular emphasis on improving its U.S. health benefits program for employees. The Company’s efforts on this front included:
•no annual cost increase for the payroll contributions in its U.S. Healthy medical, dental and vision insurance plans, impacting approximately 35,000 covered employees and more than 30,000 dependents. For approximately 19,000 employees in the U.S. earning less than $50,000 per year, the Company further reduced the cost of monthly medical insurance contributions by $240 per year; 
•providing up to $4,560 in annual medical plan contribution discounts for over 35,000 employees and their spouses and domestic partners for committing to and maintaining a healthy and tobacco-free lifestyle; 
•encouraging health and wellness education and activities by providing up to $1,000 in Health Reimbursement Account contributions to approximately 35,000 employees and their spouses or partners; and
•reimbursing up to $300 in fitness-related costs for approximately 13,000 employees.
The Company routinely continually educates its workforce on health issues of importance and has prioritized continuous education on the importance of mental well-being by providing communications and resources to all employees. The Company 
Index

believes that its investments in compensation and wellness are crucial to maintaining competitive positioning and a productive and engaged workforce.
Development and Training
To meet the needs of patients and clients in the evolving and competitive diagnostics and drug development markets, the Company is committed to creating a work environment that supports a focus on the continuous development and training of its employees. With this focus, the Company believes it is well-positioned in the long term to meet the demands of the regulatory environment and accelerate its ability to innovate and develop talent in a highly skilled and competitive talent market.
Labcorp's curriculum has three primary focus areas: regulatory training; technical training; and professional development. Regulatory training is required by laws and regulations for the Company to operate in certain areas within the life sciences industry and in certain jurisdictions. Technical training and professional development enable the Company to compete more effectively in the life sciences industry.
The Company maintains an extensive library of over 48,000 courses that are available virtually within its global learning management system. In 2022, Labcorp employees completed over 2.7 million hours of training, primarily consisting of regulatory and technical training. In addition, due to the Company’s access to sensitive and personally identifiable information, employees completed over 720,000 IT security training courses, representing more than 150,000 total hours, with the goal of maintaining IT system safety and security for clients and patients.
Labcorp also invests in the professional development of its talent, and in retaining its best employees for future internal opportunities. In 2022, employees completed more than 50,000 hours of professional development. In addition, 343 employees completed the Labcorp UK Apprenticeship program that the Company plans to expand in 2023 to include US employees.
Challenges in the talent labor market have reinforced the need to offer new and engaging learning resources. In 2021, the Company expanded its approach to tuition assistance. Through 2022, the Labcorp Education Advantage program has fully sponsored 742 employees in their pursuit of higher education in the sciences, with 13 employees completing their bachelor’s degree with this benefit. Employees enrolled in the Labcorp Education Advantage program have an 11 point lower attrition rate than the global population, evidencing a strong social and human capital impact. In addition, Labcorp added new relationships with leading academic institutions and learning partners that provide open, online courses. These partners provide video courses, job aides, and short, self-paced learning taught by industry experts.
Health and Safety
The nature of the Company's business requires employees to work directly with patients and animals. This includes the handling, processing, and testing of human or animal specimens on a daily basis. As the health and safety of employees is a primary concern, the Company has established numerous employee health and safety protocols, including engineering and administrative controls, policies, procedures, processes, and training to minimize the potential for, and the severity of, work-related injuries and illnesses.
In 2022, the Company was able to reduce its work-related injury rate per 100 employees to 1.5%, a reduction of 6.3% over 2021. The Company maintained its work-related lost work injury rate per 100 employees at 0.3%. The Company completed a Corporate EHS Audit on 15 significant laboratory facilities, allowing it to assess locations against common expectations and performance criteria. In response to COVID-19, the Company modified the audit format so that it could be effectively performed virtually, with the added benefit of reducing audit travel-related greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2022, the Company faced extraordinary challenges in assisting the nearly 400 employees, and in many cases their families, who were adversely affected by the Ukraine/Russia crisis. In response, the Company supported employees with emergency, short- and long-term housing, transportation and relocation assistance, and provided help with communications, food, and other necessary supplies and services. 
Community Engagement
The Labcorp Charitable Foundation, a private, charitable 501(c)(3) organization established by the Company, invested in more than 120 programs in 2022 that align with the Company’s strategic mission to improve health and improve lives in the areas of health, education, and community across the globe. The Foundation supports efforts to increase access to health services and create equitable opportunities for underserved populations across the globe. 
Colleagues around the globe are invited to participate in the company’s annual Employee Giving Campaign. Through the campaign, colleagues had the opportunity to donate to one or more of seven selected charities: the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, American Red Cross (Disaster Relief), United Way, the National Urban League and new for 2022, Project HOPE. Employee contributions support these charities to provide needed services in 
Index

their local communities and around the globe. The Labcorp Charitable Foundation offers a match opportunity for contributions made through the campaign. 
In addition, the Company's employees took advantage of opportunities to support charitable causes and make a positive impact in their communities. For example, in honor of the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., colleagues participated in the “Cards of Encouragement” campaign, a global initiative to lift the spirits of hospitalized children and their families. With the help of Cards for Hospitalized Kids, close to 8,000 cards were distributed to children and their families staying at Ronald McDonald Houses or receiving treatment at nonprofit children’s hospitals. The Labcorp Charitable Foundation made a financial donation to the 39 supported charities. 
The Company's global colleagues also support the local communities where they live and work. In observation of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, Company colleagues in Geneva, Switzerland supported ARFEC (Association Romande des Familles d’Enfants atteints d’un Cancer) to benefit hospitalized children and their families through toy drives, the creation and sale of a calendar and participation in the Geneva 20 kilometer race. 
Dynacare, a Labcorp company based in Canada, teamed up with Diabetes Canada to organize the #Dyncare4Diabetes campaign for the second consecutive year. The campaign raises awareness of diabetes and provides accessible and free testing for at risk individuals. In addition to offering free hemoglobin A1C testing at all Dynacare laboratory locations across the Greater Toronto Area and at mobile community clinics, Dynacare donated 50 cents to Diabetes Canada for every individual that participated in the campaign, up to a total of $25,000. 
Customers 
The Company provides its services to a broad range of customers across Dx and DD. The primary customer groups serviced by the Company include:
•Health Plans. The Company serves many health plans, including MCOs and other health insurance providers, each of which operate on a national, regional, or local basis. In certain locations, health plans may delegate to independent physician associations (IPAs) or other alternative delivery systems (e.g., ACOs) the ability to negotiate for services on behalf of certain members.

Market Opportunity
Dx
The Company believes that in 2022, the U.S. clinical laboratory testing industry generated revenues of more than $80 billion. The clinical laboratory industry consists primarily of three types of providers: hospital-based laboratories, physician-office laboratories, and independent clinical and anatomical pathology laboratories, such as those operated by Dx.
The clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive, and the Company believes that both competition and consolidation in the clinical laboratory business will continue. CMS has estimated that, as of February 2023, there were 9,165 hospital-based laboratories, 123,511 physician-office laboratories, and 9,411 independent clinical and anatomic pathology laboratories in the U.S. Dx competes with all of those laboratories. In addition, an increasing number of health system laboratories have been expanding their operations and business, resulting in greater competition for testing from physicians within those systems and from unaffiliated physicians in the health system laboratories’ service areas. 
Dx believes that the selection of a laboratory is primarily based on the following factors, all of which the Company believes it competes favorably in:
•quality, timeliness, and consistency in reporting test results;
•reputation of the laboratory in the medical community or field of specialty;
•contractual relationships with MCOs;
•service capability and convenience;
•number and type of tests performed;
•connectivity solutions offered; and
•pricing of the laboratory’s services.
In addition to the factors listed above, the Company believes that the operational and economic efficiencies provided by its integrated service and logistics network, large-scale automated testing, and regular introduction of new technologies will allow the Company to compete effectively with other providers of laboratory services.
DD
 Drug development services companies like DD are also referred to as CROs and typically derive substantially all of their revenue from research and development (R&D), as well as marketing expenditures, of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. 
Outsourcing of R&D services to CROs has increased in the past, and is expected to continue increasing in the future. Increasing pressures to improve return on investment, to increase R&D productivity, to stay abreast of scientific advances and to comply with stringent government regulations and attempts to reduce and control the price of prescription drugs have all contributed to this outsourcing to CROs. A CRO provides clients with flexibility in aligning resources to demand. In the face of mounting complexity, the investment and amount of time required to develop new products are significant and have been increasing. These trends create opportunities for DD and other CROs that can help make the development process more efficient.
The drug development industry has many participants ranging from hundreds of small providers to a limited number of large CROs with global capabilities. DD competes against these small and large CROs, as well as in-house departments of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and diagnostic companies, and to a lesser extent, selected academic research centers, universities and teaching hospitals.
DD believes that customers selecting a CRO often consider the following factors, all of which the Company believes it competes favorably in: 
•reputation for quality and regulatory compliance; 
•efficient, timely performance;
•expertise and experience in operations;
•application of technology and innovation;
•specific therapeutic and scientific expertise;
•data and analytical capabilities;

Quality
Dx and DD have comprehensive quality systems and processes appropriate for their respective businesses. The Company's quality programs are overseen by Dx's National Office of Quality, DD’s Global Regulatory Compliance and Quality Assurance Unit, DD's clinical trial services global vendor management department, DD's central laboratory services expanded laboratory management services department, and the Company's global supply chain management department and project management staff. The Company has procedures for monitoring its internal performance, as well as that of its vendors, suppliers, and other key stakeholders. In addition, various groups and departments within the Company provide oversight to monitor and control vendor products and performance, and play an essential role in the Company’s approach to quality through improvements in processes and automation. 
Virtually all facets of the Company’s services are subject to quality programs and procedures, including accuracy and reproducibility of tests, turnaround time, customer service, data integrity, patient satisfaction, and billing. The Company’s quality programs include measures that compare current performance against desired performance goals to monitor critical aspects of service to its customers and patients. This includes licensing, credentialing, training and competency of professional and technical staff, and internal auditing. In addition to the Company's own quality programs, the Company’s laboratories, facilities and processes are subject to on-site regulatory agency inspections and accreditation evaluations, in addition to surveys and proficiency testing, by local or national government agencies; independent external accrediting programs; and inspections and audits by customers. 
Thirty-three of the Company's laboratories have received ISO 15189 and/or ISO 13485 accreditation, demonstrating that they meet international standards for quality and technical competence.
Information Systems 
The Company is committed to developing and commercializing technology-enabled solutions to support its operations and provide better care. The Company operates standard platforms for its core business services and its financial and reporting systems. These standard systems provide consistency within workflows and information as well as a high level of system availability, security, and stability. The primary laboratory systems include standardized support for molecular diagnostics, digital pathology and enhanced specialty laboratory solutions. The Company's centralized information systems are responsible for operational efficiencies, enabling the Company to achieve consistent, structured, and standardized operating results and effective patient care. 
The information systems used by Dx and DD are discussed in more detail in the sections dedicated to each of those segments.
Intellectual Property Rights
The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect its proprietary technology. The Company has filed and obtained numerous patents in the U.S. and abroad, and regularly files patent applications, when appropriate, to establish and protect its proprietary technology. Occasionally, the Company also licenses U.S. and non-U.S. patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights or trademarks owned by others. The Company believes, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to its business as a whole.
Patents covering the Company's technologies are subject to challenges. Issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or declared unenforceable so that patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. In addition, the laws of some countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. 
Parties may file claims asserting that the Company's technologies infringe on their intellectual property. The Company cannot predict whether parties will assert such claims against it, or whether those claims will harm its business. If the Company is forced to defend against such claims, the Company could face costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources. As result of such disputes, the Company may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may require financial or other terms that could have an adverse effect on

the Company's business and financial condition.
Regulation and Reimbursement
General
Because the Company operates in a number of distinct environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, it is subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory requirements. Both the clinical laboratory industry and the drug development business are subject to significant governmental regulation at the national, state and local levels. As described below, these regulations concern licensure and operation of clinical laboratories, claim submission and reimbursement for laboratory services, healthcare fraud and abuse, drug development services, security and confidentiality of health information, quality, and environmental and occupational safety.
Regulation of Clinical Laboratories
Virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the U.S. must be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. In most cases, that certification is regulated by CMS through CLIA, which requires that applicable clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Clinical laboratories in locations other than the U.S. are generally subject to comparable regulation in their respective jurisdictions.
Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high-complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate-complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the FDA to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most CLIA requirements. All major and many smaller Company facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high-complexity testing. The Company's remaining smaller testing sites hold CLIA certificates to perform moderate-complexity testing or a certificate of waiver. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business; cancellation or suspension of the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement; as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records.
The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all laboratory requirements applicable to its laboratories operating both within the U.S. and in other countries. The Company's laboratories have continuing programs to maintain operations in compliance with all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the Company's laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections.
FDA and Other Regulatory Agency Laws and Regulations
Various regulatory agencies, including CMS and the FDA in the U.S., regulate the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution, storage, import, export, performance, and surveillance of diagnostic and therapeutic products and services, including certain products and services offered by the Company and the development of therapeutic products that comprise the majority of DD’s business. The FDA and other regulatory agencies periodically inspect and review the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic and therapeutic products, while CMS, certain state programs, and accreditation entities inspect and review the facilities, personnel, and procedures of clinical laboratories and their laboratory operations. The FDA and other regulatory agencies also periodically inspect clinical study sites and CROs that conduct clinical trials, including test facilities that perform tests on samples from human subjects enrolled in such clinical studies of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. These agencies have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, such as fines, withdrawal of product approval, warning or untitled letters, seizures, recalls, injunctions, and other civil and criminal sanctions.
Since 2014, there have been ongoing discussions and advocacy between stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory industry, the FDA, and Congress, about potential FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), which are assays developed and performed in-house by clinical laboratories and can be made available to the public without pre-market review by the FDA (although COVID-19 diagnostic PCR LDTs have been subject to FDA pre-market requirements as a consequence of the national health emergency). Various regulatory and legislative proposals are under consideration, including some that 
Index

could increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the Company is difficult to predict at this time.
There are similar national and regional regulatory agencies, and regulations, in the jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in which the Company operates. For example, the European Union In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (EU IVDR)), which became applicable May 26, 2022, established a new legislative framework for in vitro diagnostic devices including a rule-based classification and quality and safety standards. In addition, both Switzerland and the United Kingdom are implementing new legislative frameworks similar to the EU IVDR.
DD’s laboratory facilities and Dx's clinical laboratory facilities that perform testing in support of clinical trials, must conform to a range of standards and regulations, including good laboratory practice (GLP) and good clinical practice (GCP), good manufacturing practice (cGMP), human subject protection and investigational product exemption regulations, and quality system regulation (QSR) requirements, as applicable. The preclinical and clinical studies that the Company conducts are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA as well as other regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company operates, which may include, without limitation, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the U.K., the European Medicines Agency, the National Medical Products Administration in China, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan, to determine compliance with GLP and GCP as well as other applicable standards and regulations. If a regulatory agency determines during an inspection that the Company’s equipment, facilities, laboratories, operations, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and GLP and/or GCP standards, the regulatory agency may issue a formal notice (FDA Form 483), which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. Noncompliance may result in, among other things, unanticipated compliance expenditures, or the regulatory agency seeking civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the Company, including suspension of its operations.
The FDA Modernization Act 2.0 was enacted in December 2022 as Section 3209 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. This Act amended Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) to clarify the methods manufacturers and sponsors can use to investigate the safety and efficacy of a drug or the toxicity of a bioisimilar biologic product to include tests on animals as well as certain tests that are not performed on animals. Specifically, the Act replaces a statutory reference to “tests on animals” as a viable option for pre-clinical testing with a reference to “nonclinical tests”, which includes animal testing, cell-based assays, microphysiological systems, or bioprinted or computer models. The Act does not eliminate animal testing or require the use of non-animal models. FDA previously had the authority to allow non-animal data to be considered during safety and efficacy reviews of new drugs and had previously issued related guidance. However, many procedures intended to reduce animal tests are still in various stages of development. Since such alternative methodologies must first be validated before FDA will approve of their use instead of validated animal models, the practical impact of the Act is likely to be limited for some time.
Additionally, certain DD services and activities, such as chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) services and manufacturing of investigational medicinal products for use in certain Phase I studies managed by DD, must conform to cGMP. DD is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and the MHRA, as well as other regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company operates, in order to assess, among other things, cGMP compliance. If a regulatory agency identifies deficiencies during an inspection, it may issue a formal notice, which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. Failure to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in, among other things, fines, warnings or untitled letters, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, enforcement actions, product seizures or recalls, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.
Some Dx products are regulated by the FDA and other similar national regulatory agencies as medical devices. The FDA defines a medical device in part as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article which is intended for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man. FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post‑market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of products classified as medical devices separate from clinical diagnostic testing services offered under CLIA requirements. FDA regulatory requirements include: all of the relevant elements of the Quality System Regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), labeling regulations, restrictions on promotion and advertising, Medical Device Reporting regulations (which requires the manufacturer to report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulations (which requires manufacturers to report certain recalls and field actions to the FDA), and other post-market requirements.
To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
Index

can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant clearance or approvals of new devices; withdrawal of clearance or approval; and civil or criminal prosecution.
Animal Welfare Laws and Regulations
The conduct of animal research at DD’s facilities in the U.S. must be in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals for research in the U.S. other than laboratory rats, mice, and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The AWA establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care, and recordkeeping. DD complies with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the USDA and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the U.K., and China for the care and use of regulated species. If the USDA determines that DD’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable AWA standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. The USDA may impose fines, suspend and/or revoke licenses and registrations, or confiscate research animals. Other countries where the Company conducts business have similar laws and regulations with which the Company must also comply. In addition, certain of DD’s animal-related activities may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and similar organizations in other jurisdictions.
Payment for Clinical Laboratory Services
In 2022, Dx derived approximately 10.8% of its revenue directly from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, Dx's other commercial laboratory testing business that is not directly related to Medicare or Medicaid nevertheless depends significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs, in part because customers often want a single laboratory to perform all of their testing services. In recent years, both governmental and private-sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce healthcare costs, including reducing reimbursement for clinical laboratory services.
Reimbursement under the Medicare PFS is capped at different rates in each Medicare Administrative Contractor's jurisdiction. Pursuant to PAMA, unless modified by Congress, reimbursement under the CLFS is set at a national rate that is updated every three years for most tests. State Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients. Laboratories primarily bill and are reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid directly for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. For beneficiaries that participate in Managed Medicare and Managed Medicaid plans, laboratory bills are submitted to and paid by MCOs that manage those plans. Approximately 8.9% of Dx's revenue is reimbursed directly by Medicare under the CLFS.
Many pathology services performed by Dx are reimbursed by Medicare under the PFS. The PFS assigns relative value units to each procedure or service, and a conversion factor is applied to calculate the reimbursement. The PFS is also subject to adjustment on an annual basis. Such adjustments can impact both the conversion factor and relative value units. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), the formula previously used to calculate the fee schedule conversion factor, would have resulted in significant decreases in payment for most physician services for each year since 2003. However, Congress intervened repeatedly to prevent these payment reductions, and the conversion factor was increased or frozen for the subsequent year. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) permanently replaced the SGR formula and transitioned PFS reimbursement to a value-based payment system. MACRA retroactively avoided a 21.2% reduction in PFS reimbursement that had been scheduled for April 1, 2015, and provided for PFS conversion factor increases of 0.5% from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and 0.5% in each of years 2016-2019, followed by no updates for 2020 through 2025, and updates that vary based on participation in alternative payment models in subsequent years. These changes to the conversion factor may be offset by reductions to the relative value units, as was the case with the 2016 PFS reductions. For 2022, Congress increased the conversion factor by 3.0% over the amount announced in the final rule, instead of allowing a 3.75% reduction to take effect. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, Congress mitigated PFS cuts in 2023 and 2024 by 2.5% and 1.25%, respectively, that would otherwise have been (4.47%) in 2023 based on the conversation factor put forward in the 2023 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule final rule. Approximately 0.4% of Dx's revenue is reimbursed under the PFS.
In addition to changes in reimbursement rates, Dx is also impacted by changes in coverage policies for laboratory tests and annual CPT coding revisions. Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements and payment policies negatively impact Dx's ability to be paid for some of the tests it performs. Further, some payers require additional information to process claims, employ third-party utilization management tools, or have implemented prior authorization policies which delay or prohibit payment. In 2022, there were limited coding and billing changes. While limited changes are expected to be implemented in 2023, the Company typically expects some delays in pricing and reimbursement as new codes are introduced.
Index

Future changes in national, state and local laws and regulations (or in the interpretation of current regulations) affecting government payment for clinical laboratory testing could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Further healthcare reform could occur in 2023, including changes to the ACA and Medicare reform, as well as administrative requirements that may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services in ways that are currently unpredictable.
Privacy, Security and Confidentiality of Health Information and Other Personal Information
In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) was designed to address issues related to the security and confidentiality of health information and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions. These regulations apply to health plans and healthcare providers that conduct standard transactions electronically and healthcare clearinghouses (covered entities). Six such regulations include: (i) the Transactions and Code Sets Rule; (ii) the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the Standard Unique Employer Identifier Rule; (v) the National Provider Identifier Rule; and (vi) the Health Plan Identifier Rule. The Company, which may act as a HIPAA covered entity in certain circumstances, believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with each of the HIPAA Rules identified above.
The Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to contractually bind third parties, known as business associates, in the event that they perform an activity or service for or on behalf of the covered entity that involves the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of PHI. 
On February 6, 2014, CMS and HHS published final regulations that amended the HIPAA Privacy Rule to provide individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to receive copies of their test reports from laboratories subject to HIPAA, or to request that copies of their test reports be transmitted to designated third parties. 
On December 12, 2018, HHS issued a request for information (RFI) seeking input from the public on how the HIPAA regulations and the Privacy Rule, in particular, could be modified to amend existing, or impose additional, obligations relating to the processing of PHI. Subsequent to the RFI, on January 21, 2021, HHS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) containing potential modifications to the Privacy Rule addressing standards that may impede the transition to value-based healthcare and strengthen individuals' rights to access their health information. The public comment period for the NPRM was closed on May 6, 2021. The Company is monitoring the NPRM process. If modifications to the Privacy Rule are adopted, they may impact the Company's compliance obligations under HIPAA. 
The U.S. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which was enacted in February 2009, with regulations effective on September 23, 2013, strengthened and expanded the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and their restrictions on use and disclosure of PHI. HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging PHI for remuneration and additional restrictions on the use of PHI for marketing. HITECH also fundamentally changes a business associate’s obligations by imposing a number of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to provide notice to individuals, HHS, and, as applicable, the media when unsecured PHI is breached, as that term is defined by HITECH. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach. 
 The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA mandate the adoption of standard unique identifiers for healthcare providers. The intent of these provisions is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the electronic transmission of health information. The National Provider Identifier Rule requires that all HIPAA-covered healthcare providers, whether they are individuals or organizations, must obtain an NPI to identify themselves in standard HIPAA transactions. NPI replaces the unique provider identification number and other provider numbers previously assigned by payers and other entities for the purpose of identifying healthcare providers in standard electronic transactions. 
Violations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. HITECH also significantly strengthened HIPAA enforcement by increasing the civil penalty amounts that may be imposed, requiring HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizing state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that affect the privacy of state residents. 
The total cost associated with meeting the ongoing requirements of HIPAA and HITECH is not expected to be material to the Company’s operations or cash flows. However, future regulations and interpretations of HIPAA and HITECH could impose significant costs on the Company.
The information blocking provisions (Information Blocking Rules) of the 21st Century Cures Act became effective on April 
Index

5, 2021. The Information Blocking Rules prohibit covered actors, including healthcare providers, from engaging in activity that is likely to interfere with the access, exchanges, or use of electronic health information (EHI) unless such activity falls into one of eight exceptions. The Information Blocking Rules provide for civil monetary penalties for noncompliance by healthcare IT vendors and, separately, “appropriate disincentives” for noncompliance by healthcare providers. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the Information Blocking Rules. 
In addition to the regulations described above, numerous other data protection, privacy and similar laws govern the confidentiality, security, use, and disclosure of personal information, as well as breach notification responsibilities. These laws vary by jurisdiction, but they most commonly regulate or restrict the collection, use, and disclosure of medical and financial information and other personal information. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has authority to regulate unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including with respect to data privacy and security. If the Company’s public statements about collection, use or disclosure of personal information are perceived to be inconsistent with the Company’s actual practices, the Company may face accusations of unfairness or deception under the FTC Act or state law equivalents. In addition, some state laws are more restrictive and, therefore, are not preempted by HIPAA. Penalties for violation of these laws may include sanctions against a laboratory's licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. 
Congress and state legislatures also have been implementing new legislation relating to privacy and data protection. For example, on June 28, 2018, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA created transparency requirements and granted California residents several new rights with regard to their personal information. In addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) ballot initiative, which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA). The amendments introduced by the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. Other states have passed legislation similar to the CCPA, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), which became effective January 1, 2023, the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA), both effective July 1, 2023, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA), effective December 31, 2023. The VCDPA, CPA, CTDPA, and UCPA heavily mirror the principles and requirements of the CCPA; however, these laws do not provide for a private right of action. The Company continues to assess the impact of these laws on the Company’s business, and the Company is implementing and will prepare to implement appropriate processes to manage compliance with these laws as they become effective and more guidance is provided. 
Effective August 14, 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of HHS (SAMHSA) announced the finalization of proposed changes to the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records regulation, 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 2. This regulation protects the confidentiality of patient records relating to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment that are maintained in connection with the performance of any federally assisted program or activity relating to substance use disorder education, prevention, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research. Under the regulation, patient identifying information may only be released with the individual’s written consent, subject to certain limited exceptions. The latest changes to this regulation seek to better facilitate care coordination, while maintaining more stringent confidentiality of substance use disorder information. The Company adopted changes to its policies and procedures necessary for compliance.
The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Regulation (EU) 2016/679, became effective May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR established requirements applicable to the use and transfer of personal data and imposes penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR, as well as the U.K.'s implementation - the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation - requires transparency with regard to the means and purposes of processing of personal data; collection of consent to process personal data in certain circumstances; the ability to provide records of processing upon request by a supervisory authority or data controller; implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to maintain security of personal data; notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities, data controllers, and individuals within expedient time frames; and performance of data protection impact assessments for certain processing activities. The GDPR also provides individual data subjects with certain rights, where applicable, including the right of access, the right to rectification, the right to be forgotten, the right to restrict or object to processing, and the right to data portability. The GDPR requires that personal data may only be transferred outside of the European Union to a country that offers an adequate level of data protection under standards set by the European Union, or where such transfer is otherwise pursuant to a legal framework approved by the European Union. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) released its decision in Data Protection Commission v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (Schrems II), which invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a legal framework for the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union, and suggesting additional safeguards for the use of Standard Contractual Clauses 
Index

(SCCs) as a legal framework for the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission release updated SCCs, which, in part, adopted many of the additional safeguards highlighted in the Schrems II decision. Companies using SCCs for the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union are required to use the new SCCs for new transfers of personal data as of September 27, 2021, and for all transfers of personal data as of December 27, 2022. The Company has established processes and frameworks to manage compliance with the GDPR and other global privacy and data protection requirements, and to manage preparation for future enacted regulations. Compliance could impose significant costs on the Company.
In addition to the GDPR, numerous other countries have laws governing the collection, use, disclosure, and transmission (including cross-border transfer) of personal information, including medical information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection is complex and continually evolving. Data protection regulations have been enacted or updated in regions where the Company does business including in Asia, Latin America, and Europe, and in countries such as Canada, India, and the UK. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in, among other things, civil, criminal and contractual liability, fines, regulatory sanctions and damage to the Company’s reputation. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations
Existing U.S. laws governing federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, OIG and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The U.S. government's enforcement efforts have been conducted under statutory authorities such as those contained in HIPAA, which includes several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund U.S., state and local law enforcement efforts, and in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which included requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the U.S. False Claims Act. Amendments to the False Claims Act, and other enhancements to the U.S. fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, have further increased fraud and abuse enforcement efforts and compliance risks. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identification (whether or not paid through any fault of the recipient); failure to comply with this requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute. 
The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce the referral of, Medicare, Medicaid or other U.S. federal healthcare program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in U.S. federal healthcare programs. The OIG has published “safe harbor” regulations that specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; rather, the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just government healthcare programs).
From time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the healthcare industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other fraud and abuse laws. OIG Special Fraud Alerts and Advisory Opinions relevant to the Company set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and healthcare providers that raise issues under the U.S. fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. These practices include: (i) providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of the physicians’ staff; (ii) offering or providing discounted laboratory services billed to referral sources in return for referrals of other tests that are billed to U.S. federal healthcare programs; (iii) providing free testing to physicians’ managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pickup and disposal of biohazardous waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory’s testing services; (v) providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; (vi) providing free testing for healthcare providers, their families and their employees (i.e., so-called “professional courtesy” testing); (vii) rental of space in physician offices by equipment suppliers or other healthcare entities to which the physicians make referrals; (viii) compensation paid by laboratories to physicians and hospitals for blood specimen processing and for submitting patient data to registries; and (ix) remuneration provided to physicians and other health care professionals by pharmaceutical and medical device companies in connection with company-sponsored speaker programs.
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, in October 2018, the U.S. enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA), as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act). EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical

treatment facility, or laboratory. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. As drafted, an EKRA prohibition on incentive compensation to sales employees is inconsistent with the federal anti-kickback statute and regulations, which permit payment of employee incentive compensation, a practice that is common in the industry. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued, and there is no additional DOJ or other government guidance to indicate how and to what extent it will be applied and enforced in the industry. The Company is working through its trade association to address the scope of EKRA.
Under another U.S. statute, known as the Stark Law or “physician self-referral” prohibition, physicians who have a financial or a compensation relationship with a clinical laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare or Medicaid patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark Law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (i) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (ii) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (iii) ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician's own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; (iv) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and (v) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just government reimbursement programs.
In December 2020, the OIG and CMS published final rules to amend certain regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, respectively. The amendments were primarily intended to alleviate perceived impediments to coordinated care and value-based compensation arrangements through new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute and new exceptions to the Stark Law, and have varying degrees of applicability to laboratories. The CMS final rule incorporates laboratories and permits support for value-based arrangements, under certain conditions for purposes of the Stark Law. However, the OIG final rule generally excludes laboratories from protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for value-based arrangements. 
There are a variety of other types of U.S. and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims and that require certain companies to disclose payments and other transfers of value to certain healthcare professionals and providers. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all U.S. and state fraud and abuse laws. The Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no assurances can be given that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other U.S. or state healthcare programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a U.S. healthcare program, or material loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
Enrollment and re-enrollment in U.S. healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to certain program integrity requirements intended to protect the programs from fraud, waste, and abuse. In September 2019, CMS published a final rule implementing program integrity enhancements to provider enrollment requiring Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) providers and suppliers to disclose on an enrollment application or a revalidation application any current or previous direct or indirect affiliation with a provider or supplier that (i) has uncollected debt; (ii) has been or is subject to a payment suspension under a federal health care program; (iii) has been or is excluded by the OIG from Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP, or (iv) has had its Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP billing privileges denied or revoked. This rule permits CMS to deny enrollment based on such an affiliation when CMS determines that the affiliation poses an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse. CMS is phasing in this new affiliation disclosure requirement.
In November 2021, CMS published a final rule for the 2022 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, which included further program integrity requirements. CMS finalized its proposal to expand the categories of parties within the purview of the denial and revocation provisions to include excluded administrative or management services personnel who furnish services payable by a federal healthcare program, such as a billing specialist, accountant, or human resources specialist. CMS also codified the billing privilege deactivation rebuttal process, under which a provider or supplier would have 15 calendar days from receipt of written notice of a deactivation to submit a rebuttal, and CMS could, in its discretion, extend the 15-day period to account for certain special situations. In addition, CMS defined factors it would use to determine whether revocation or suspension of billing privileges is appropriate due to a pattern or practice of non-compliant billing, which would be: (i) the percentage of submitted claims that were denied during the period under consideration; (ii) whether the provider or supplier has any history of final adverse actions and the nature of any such actions; (iii) the type of billing non-compliance and the specific facts surrounding said non-compliance (to the extent this can be determined); and (iv) any other information regarding the provider's

or supplier's specific circumstances that CMS deems relevant to the determination. This is a reduction in the number of factors that were previously considered and a revision of some previous factors. 
Environment, Health, and Safety
The Company is subject to licensing and requirements under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations include the safe handling, use, transportation and disposal of potentially infectious and hazardous materials; the assessment of potential work-related risks and establishment of work practice and engineering controls, and providing protective clothing and equipment, training, and medical surveillance; designed to minimize risk to employee health and safety and the environment. 
The Company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint. The Company participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and the EcoVadis sustainable procurement rating processes. In December 2022, the Company submitted science-based targets to the Science Based Target Institute. Energy-saving measures at Company facilities include for example, installation of more efficient boilers, chillers, ventilation systems and LED lighting, engaging in waste-to-energy disposition, and reducing waste going to landfills. Funding for these and similar projects continued through 2022 and is expected to continue through 2023.
The Company seeks to comply with all relevant environment, employee health and safety laws and regulations. Failure to comply could subject the Company to various administrative and/or other enforcement actions. 
Drug Testing
Drug testing for public sector employees is regulated by the SAMHSA, which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to be approved to perform drug testing on employees of U.S. government contractors and certain other entities. To the extent that the Company’s laboratories perform such testing, each must be certified as meeting SAMHSA standards. The Company’s laboratories in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Raritan, New Jersey; Houston, Texas; Southaven, Mississippi; and St. Paul, Minnesota are all SAMHSA certified. 
Controlled Substances
DD handles controlled substances as part of the services it provides in preclinical testing and clinical trials. The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs of abuse is regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and its implementing regulations. The CSA establishes, among other things, certain registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements for controlled substances. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with these requirements as applicable. Violations of these rules may result in criminal and civil fines and penalties.
Compliance Program
The Company maintains a global compliance program that includes ongoing evaluation and monitoring of its compliance with the laws and regulations of the U.S. and the other countries in which it has operations. The objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement, monitor, and update compliance safeguards, as appropriate. Although the Company is subject to a broad range of regulations, its compliance program has a particular focus on regulations related to healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, physician self-referral, government reimbursement programs, anti-bribery/anti-corruption, anti-human trafficking, and trade sanctions, among others. Emphasis is placed on developing and implementing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs, monitoring and auditing activities, and providing systems for reporting and investigation of potential or actual compliance concerns. The compliance program demonstrates the Company's commitment to conducting business at the highest standards of ethical conduct and integrity.
The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations and drug development business. The clinical laboratory industry and drug development industries are, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. In addition, the applicability or interpretation of statutes and regulations may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science, healthcare technology, and healthcare organizations. Applicable statutes and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would materially adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates, and authorizations necessary to operate, as well as potential liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
