INTRODUCTION
 
Evolving Systems provides real-time digital engagement solutions and services to more than 100 customers in over 65 countries worldwide. Our portfolio includes market-leading solutions and services for real-time analytics, customer acquisition and activation, customer value management and loyalty for the telecom industry promoting partnerships into retail and financial services.
 
Our acquisitions in 2017 of BLS Limited (EVOL BLS) and four Lumata Holdings subsidiaries, Lumata France SAS, Lumata Spain S.L., Lumata UK Ltd and Lumata Deutschland GmbH (collectively, Lumata Entities), along with the acquisition of RateIntegration d/b/a Sixth Sense Media (SSM) in 2015 ushered our entry into the high value digital engagement space and also initiated our adoption of a recurring revenue business model based on managed services and Software as a Service (SaaS).
 
We have transitioned from offering traditional software technology licensing, focused on cost savings, to offering business solutions focused on revenue growth and efficiency gains for the carrier. Our business model has moved from classic capital expenditure license and services to operating expense models based on managed services, including transaction and performance fees.
 
We offer real-time, interactive digital engagement solutions and services that drive increases in customer lifetime value for our enterprise clients:
 
·                  Acquisition and Activation Solutions that increase new subscriber enrollments through multiple channels and dealer networks, electronically authenticate customer identity and activate complex bundles of traditional telecom services (voice, messaging and data) and value-added network services;
 ·                  Retention and Loyalty Solutions that extend the duration of customer contracts by engaging them with the brand, interacting and rewarding them with personalized offers through loyalty and partner programs; and
 ·                  Analytics and Value Management Solutions that analyze consumer behavior in real-time and enable marketing departments to innovate, create and manage highly-personalized and contextually-relevant interactive campaigns that engage consumers with event-triggered offers that result in higher take-rates and increased customer revenue.
 
The combination of these offerings increases customer activations and activity, extends their lifecycle and increases customer spend resulting in increased customer lifetime value.
 
COMPANY BACKGROUND
 
Evolving Systems was founded in 1985 to provide software and services to the U.S. telecommunications industry. During our early years we focused on providing solutions that supported number management and number porting. In November 2004, we expanded our product set and geographical reach with the acquisition of Tertio Telecoms Ltd. (Evolving Systems U.K.), a supplier of Operations Support Systems (OSS) software solutions for service activation and mediation to communication carriers throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. With this acquisition we not only expanded our markets beyond North America, we also added service activation and mediation solutions to our product portfolio. The acquisition significantly expanded our product and service capabilities, allowing us to address a larger portion of our customers OSS application needs with a balanced mix of products

as well as services. We focused primarily on the wireless markets in the areas of subscriber activation, SIM card management and activation, selfservice mobile applications, data enablement solutions, connected device activation and management of services.
 
On October 24, 2013 we acquired privately held Telespree Communications (Telespree), now known as Evolving Systems Labs, Inc. (Evolving Systems Labs), for an initial payment of approximately $1.6 million comprised of approximately $0.8 million in cash and approximately $0.8 million in stock. The acquisition included technology used in the delivery and management of mobile data services and a portfolio of SaaS based solutions. We were not required to make the additional contingent payments potentially payable by us under the acquisition agreement and we recognized other income in 2016 and the three months ended June 30, 2018.
 
On September 30, 2015, we acquired privately held SSM, now known as Evolving Systems NC, Inc. (Evolving Systems NC) for an initial cash payment totaling approximately $9.75 million, plus customary working capital adjustments, and we agreed to make a payment of $250,000 on the one-year anniversary of the transaction, with such payment being available to secure SSMs representations and warranties under the acquisition agreement. This payment was offset against other obligations during 2018 and was not made. The acquisition included SSMs software solution, RLM, a platform which enables carrier marketing departments to innovate, execute and manage highly-personalized and contextually-relevant, interactive campaigns that engage consumers in real-time as well as a platform for Customer Loyalty and Retention.
 
On July 3, 2017, BLS Limited (EVOL BLS), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the purchase of Business Logic Systems Limited (BLS), a provider of customer value management solutions and data driven marketing solutions. EVOL BLS and BLS are both companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement(the Purchase Agreement), BLS sold substantially all of its assets and transferred certain liabilities relating to BLSs business for £1.2 million ($1.6 million) in cash, plus (a) an additional sum of £0.1 million ($0.1 million), reduced by any sums paid by EVOL BLS for certain employee severance obligations (collectively, the Cash Payments); (b) a percentage of collections on certain receivables over a 24-month period; and (c) an earnout equal to 50% of BLS based revenue over defined threshold levels for a period of 3 years after the closing date. We made the earn-out payment in November 2018 of approximately $0.8 million. No future payments are expected at this time. BLS specializes in data-driven customer value management and customer engagement solutions that have been implemented in over 20 mobile operators in Europe, Africa, Asia-Pacific and the Caribbean. BLS solutions turn customer data into actionable insights and personalized contextual offers. Customer engagement occurs through in-bound and out-bound offers and is further extended through a suite of loyalty and retention solutions.
 
On September 7, 2017, Evolving Systems Holdings Limited (EVOL Holdings) acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of four (4) Lumata Holdings (Seller) subsidiaries, (Lumata Entities), in exchange for a cash payment totaling 4.0 million ($4.8 million), subject to certain adjustments. In connection with the acquisition, EVOL Holdings entered into a Term Loan Facility Agreement, a Debenture and a Subordination Deed with East West Bank as lender in the amount of $4,730,000 (collectively, the Loan Facility Agreements).
 
The Lumata Entities are a leading global provider of real-time, next generation loyalty and customer lifecycle management software and services that allow businesses to analyze customer data for relevant and contextual insights that will support additional services. Its customers are mobile operators including Orange, Telefonica and other Tier-1 and emerging operators in Europe and around the world.
 
We are now a leading supplier of real-time digital engagement solutions and services that drive growth in customer acquisition and activation, extend customer lifetime and increase customer value and revenue in the converging mobile, entertainment, financial and retail services eco-system. Our platforms, together with our team of experienced industry experts, help service providers increase their customer lifetime value (CLV) over the course the customer lifecycle.
 
INDUSTRY DYNAMICS
 
The market for digital engagement to increase customer lifetime value is growing. Several key factors are driving carrier demand for next generation solutions, supporting growth for specific products within the sector:
 
·                      Carriers are seeking to further monetize their customer relationships and associated demographic, behavioral, location and contextual information to up-sell their network services and open new channels for optimized and personalized third-party service revenues;
 ·                      Rapid adoption of smart phones and network-attached devices has resulted in increased usage of mobile data;
 ·                      On-going network investment in 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) networks is driving increased demand for digital engagement solutions;
 
2




·                      Carriers are experiencing pricing pressure driven by relatively flat subscriber growth, network upgrade costs, subscriber churn and increased competition from traditional and new market entrants such as Over-the-Top (OTT) services both in the developed and emerging markets; and,
 ·                      Adoption of the Enterprise Mobility and Machine to Machine (M2M) requirements are driving further demand.
 
Today, carriers are compelled to offer a growing array of services to deliver personalized and differentiated user experiences, reduce subscriber churn and maintain or grow market share. These value-added services have to be delivered to the market in ever shorter windows as competitive pressure has increased the velocity at which carriers deliver new products and services. To achieve these objectives, operators are increasingly reliant on flexible service enablement solutions that offer a myriad of options for their subscribers.
 
As network migrations to 5G, IoT and M2M accelerate, the SIM card and embedded SIM (eSIM) have emerged as vital links in the end-to-end value chain. Evolving Systems full life cycle management of SIMs and eSIMs from ordering, dynamically activating and managing the SIM card is becoming an important component in the service providers infrastructure, both to reduce operating costs associated with the provisioning of SIM cards, as well as to improve the end-user experience. We are a pioneer and leader in this market and believe we are well-positioned to maintain our leadership role in this growth segment. To date our Subscriber Activation solution has activated over 700 million SIM cards, providing enhanced functionality and significant operator savings.
 
In a market where consumers perceive their telecom services as a commodity, maintaining or growing customer value and retaining valuable customers is a persistent challenge. Customers are demanding ever greater incentives for their loyalty, attracted by disruptive OTT alternatives and competitive offers on data, airtime, and SMS. This can lead to a spiral of price-driven value destruction unless a truly differentiated approach is used to stand out from the crowd and deliver superior value.
 
The digital revolution offers unparalleled opportunities to generate new revenue streams, create highly relevant and differentiated offerings, and deliver more engaging customer experiences to the growing universe of connected consumers. But a digital environment requires a whole new way of interacting with consumers in real-time, via multiple channels such as apps, web, email, as well as traditional SMS, in a highly contextual manner. Having a deep understanding of customer preferences and behavior is critical in this digital environment full of demanding customers.
 
Mobile service is ubiquitous and mobile operators are the digital enablers between consumers and brands, the trusted processors of customer data, uniquely able to bridge the digital and physical world through their technology infrastructure. The mobile industry is going through a transition period. Traditional voice and messaging revenues are in decline due to several factors including the over-the-top OTT players. Mobile data demand is growing. Service providers are focused on building upon their brand and their last mile connectivity to more actively engage their customers and to increase the customer wallet-share through digital and non-digital partnerships.
 
We help service providers navigate through the digital marketing jungle of fragmented technologies, converging communication channels and managing the data overload through our portfolio of digital engagement solutions. We combine big ideas and a deep understanding of mobile customer behavior with powerful software capabilities and expertise to create digital engagement & loyalty experiences that stand out from the crowd.
 
We sit at the intersection of technology and marketing. Our solutions leverage mechanics such as digital vouchering, digital badges, in-app engagement, etc. to drive a two-sided business model, where we generate value from 3rd party brands, as well as retail customers. It is a continuous circle where customers increase spending and extend tenure in return for perceived high value rewards and experiences, which brands provide in order to access a highly targeted mobile customer base.
 
Connecting brands and consumers, via a digital platform, positions the mobile operator at the center of commerce, content and communication flows in the connected world. Using our solutions, mobile operators have access to accurate data on customer preferences, behavior, spending, etc. While it is critical to ensure customer opt-in for data use, industry research confirms that consumers will allow a trusted mobile operator to use their information in return for highly relevant and attractive incentives.
 
DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO
 
Acquisition and Activation
 
Our Subscriber Acquisition and Activation solutions support carriers in adding new subscribers to their network, beginning with the sales and contract process through the allocation of network and service resources and the activation of services to the mobile device.

·                  Smart Dealer provides SIM retailers with a tool set that enables them to sell SIM cards efficiently and effectively. With Smart Dealer, the operator is able to communicate and guide dealers towards using the latest promotions, enabling instant reactions to competitor activities. Smart Dealer captures subscriber details for Know Your Customer prepaid registration, including biometric data, using standard, low cost devices.
 
·                  Dynamic SIM AllocationTM is a SIM/eSIM Activation solution which is integrated into the carriers signaling network, enabling new SIM cards or eSIMs that have not been pre-provisioned to be detected on first use in consumer and IoT Markets. This triggers an efficient, dynamic provisioning process and eliminates the need for pre-provisioning, thus lowering the operators costs of subscriber acquisition and eSIM bootstrapping. The SIM/eSIM activation occurs only when a SIM/eSIM card is first used. During the activation process, the solution enables an on-device interaction with the end-user, delivering a differentiated user-experience, reducing customer churn and boosting revenue for the carrier.
 
·                  Tertio® Service Activation is used by carriers to activate a new subscriber or to add a new service to an existing subscriber. Our solution provides a flexible operating environment for carriers to manage their voice, data, and content service needs for both their traditional and broadband IP networks. It provides a point of flexibility in the carriers OSS/BSS architecture, allowing fast introduction of new network technologies and easing the burden of integration with existing devices and systems. Service providers who use our Tertio solution can better plan, manage and execute the introduction of new services.
·                  Number Inventory and Management is a scalable and fully automated solution that enables operators to reliably and efficiently manage their telephone numbers (i.e. eSIMs and eSIM profiles, SIMs, MSISDNs, IMSIs, Integrated Circuit Card Identifiers (ICCIDs) as well as other communication identifiers such as Uniform Resource Locators or (URLs) and email addresses. Our solution focuses on the automation of all number resource management processes, allowing operators to adhere to regulatory requirements and effectively manage the lifecycle of telephone numbers, as well as benefit from time savings and reduced costs.
Customer Analytics and Value Management
 
Our Customer Analytics and Value Management solutions empower marketing departments to create and deploy highly personalized, location and contextually relevant, interactive customer engagement campaigns. Our most recent version of our cutting-edge Evolution platform launched in the first quarter of 2019 enables us to deliver a full-service solution at the clients site or hosted in our cloud and provided as SaaS subscription. The platform monitors customer events and behavioral patterns in real-time, building a profile of each subscriber. When the right conditions are met, the platform pushes the best match or a personalized offer or ad to the customer.
 
Compared with many other marketing campaign management systems, our solution more accurately targets marketing messages and campaigns that drive incremental revenue more quickly.
 
·                  The Profiling Engine supports static as well as ongoing dynamic profiling of subscribers. It fully supports any real-time or micro segmentation requirements as needed by the business. The Profiling Engine is a rules-driven flexible aggregator of subscriber baseline and usage data. It has been designed to handle any data model, including any data representation that may be available within the carriers legacy billing and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) environment.
·                  The Campaign Engine is used to configure and deliver marketing campaigns and offers to subscribers. It includes a business-friendly dashboard that enables rapid configuration, testing and launching of new business campaigns. Through the dashboard the business user can target specific subscribers, define offers and rewards, and create personalized messages per campaign, interaction and subscriber. The dashboard provides a real-time view on each campaigns effectiveness and impact.
·                  Campaign Modules provide predefined templates for specific types of real-time mobile marketing tactics, including marketing for data bundles, digital services such as music, video, movies, gaming, entertainment, and mobile money as well as non-digital services including retail offers.
·                  Social Media Integration enables carriers to expand their engagement with subscribers beyond simple network usage and direct channels and can support social marketing campaigns that leverage the subscribers as a part of the marketing network.

·                  App Promotion engages subscribers when they are first configuring new services or when they are upgrading to mobile devices with new capabilities. It enables carriers to promote the use of their own mobile applications for subscriber care, and also those of third-party app publishers, opening possibilities for new revenue streams.
Customer Retention and Loyalty
 
Our Customer Retention and Loyalty solutions help reduce churn, extend the customer lifecycle and generate more revenue from existing subscribers by using the latest innovative programs. Strong subscriber loyalty is created by rewarding subscribers via programs that offer additional carrier services or the services and products of participating partners.
 
Brand partnerships are the true differentiators given the commoditization of typical carrier offers in the market. Some of the examples of digital engagement concepts we have created include the first digital badges concept in the telecom sector with Orange, the largest and most successful film vouchering programs with Orange, & Everything Everywhere, innovative Recharge & Instant Win mechanics in prepaid markets, and two of the most successful loyalty programs in the tough African market. These concepts were designed with specific mechanics that work within the local market in conjunction with brand partners. They are successful solutions which endure, because of key ingredients such as simple customer journeys, perceived high value rewards and innovative engagement mechanics in conjunction with strategic brand partnerships.
 
The key modules include:
 
·                  Loyalty Points and Programs are used to reward mobile subscribers for use of the carriers services. Credit is earned in the forms of status points and bonus points. Gamification can be used to encourage the collection of rewards by subscribers and comparison with others in their social group. Loyalty credit is then exchanged for services or discounts from the carrier, or for digital and physical goods from third party businesses and retail partners.
·                  Coupon, Voucher and Badges Management covers the whole lifecycle of coupons, vouchers and badges as a medium for delivering rewards. Our solution manages the interface with partners, the delivery of coupons to subscribers, redemption for digital or physical goods, and settlement between carrier and partner.
·                  Digital Engagement Engine includes several solution components:
 
·                  Proprietary framework for engagement concept design and partner selection;
 ·                  Flexible business rules to define tiers to earn, burn or transfer credits;
 ·                  Multi-variable definition to calculate loyalty, including spend, tenure, social advocacy, brand engagement, digital maturity, etc.;
 ·                  Intelligent predictive analytics engine and segmentation capability;
 ·                  Channel agnostic redemption capability with standard partner APIs to connect into Point of Sale retail systems and other redemption networks; and,
 ·                  Tier 1 carrier grade data capture and configurable provisioning engine.
 
MANAGED SERVICES (MARKETING AND EXPERT IT SERVICES)
 
Our Marketing Services team works through a five-stage approach to assist our clients marketing departments in growing their customer base and engaging and retaining their valuable customers:
 
·                  Engage: We design engagement plans that map against specific segments based on propensity to participate and lifetime value indicators.
 ·                  Interact: We design the push and real-time trigger-based interactions with customers to attract them into the program and keep them engaged.
 ·                  Reward: We define a broad range of trigger events and a variety of engagement mechanics (points, badges, instant wins, vouchers, etc.).
 ·                  Redeem: We work with partners to stitch together a redemption network online and offline, so customers have highly relevant, branded rewards (a key source of differentiation and program longevity) from which to choose.
 ·                  Optimise/Learn: We use program data, overlay program results from our global customer base, and apply an iterative process to reach the right customers with meaningful incentives.
 
Our experienced IT Services team provides expert consulting services for the customization, integration and deployment of our solutions. Our services cover all aspects of the project lifecycle, including system architecture, design, software development and
 
5




customization, system integration, testing, live deployment and production support, program and project level management, post-implementation maintenance and domain and product expertise.
 
We deliver our Managed Services both on-site at a carriers facilities or remotely. Services range from operational support of our software solutions, technical services to expand those solutions with new modules and functionality to support new business value, marketing and customer engagement consultancy that directly drives marketing campaigns for our customers and helps them achieve their business objectives. The Managed Services teams also offer their expertise and experience to create the maximum financial impact to the carrier from using our solutions.
 
Our teams work closely with customers and integration partners and have established long-term relationships with operators in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific regions.
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
We develop most of our products and services internally in our innovation labs in North Carolina, France, Romania and India. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also allows us to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We conduct research to identify specific industry and client business needs as well as market requirements and we use that information to determine our investment in product development. We evaluate the market for new products and we leverage our existing product capabilities with enhancements of existing products. We build investment plans for our principal product areas and we make other investments in tools and product extensions to accelerate the development, implementation and integration process for customer solutions.
 
We are currently continuing our on-going investment in our Evolution platform, a combination of software capabilities achieved through each of our acquisitions, which will provide a powerful environment to configure and operate rich Customer Lifecycle Journeys from acquisition to retention through a variety of engagement models, offer and loyalty programs. Primarily designed to address integrated mobile digital engagement needs it can accommodate any type of customer and any type of use case. The platforms Customer Journey Manager will be responsible for profiling individual engagements to enable better insights and more automation. This approach produces more relevant and engaging predictions and offers for us to present to customers.
 
The platform will provide service providers with unmatched artificial intelligence based on smart data and operational predictive analytics functions enabling to improve efficiency and to maximize revenues, all the while reducing time and effort to execute hundreds of micro-segmented engagements and offers. We intend to take our digital engagement readiness solution for carriers beyond just enabling clients to use their traditional data. The new platform will move beyond its current SQL engine to using a Kafka-engine-powered big data platform. This will enable the real-time processing of multiple data-streams for unlimited flexibility and scalability.
 
Our Evolution platform will be used to operate the most innovative large-scale loyalty programs, as well as to provide unique mechanics enabling gamification, optimization and personalization across a variety of channels. It will enable our clients to engage with their customers at all stage of their lifecycle, providing interactive dialogue and smart recommendations through all available traditional and digital channels. The platform will seamlessly integrate within the service providers IT infrastructure, either on-premise or on a private cloud. It will be operated or managed as a service depending on the market needs.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
Our sales force is primarily a field organization structured to focus on specific geographical territories around the world including North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States (comprised of Russia and other former Soviet Republics), South Asia and Asia Pacific. Our sales activities cover direct sales to enterprise customers as well as sales through partners and resellers. Partners include Ericsson, Gemalto and Idemia who include our products as part of their wider solution offerings and systems integrators such as IBM, Amdocs and Atos, who license our technology to customers as part of their delivery engagements. The resellers include regional or country specific companies that manage our customer relationships in countries where English is not the primary language.
 
Our solutions and our customers infrastructures are complex and require a high degree of consultative selling which often results in a long sales cycle in excess of twelve months. In addition, our business relies on incremental revenue from existing customers, which requires regular interaction with customers to discuss enhancements to our existing solutions as well as the introduction of new features and functionality. The sales team is also responsible for making proactive proposals to prospects, as well as managing and delivering responses to competitive tenders. This complex, highly interactive approach, typically results in a long sales cycle, requiring us to invest a considerable amount of time developing business opportunities without guaranteed sales.

Our marketing organization supports our sales activities by identifying markets for our products and establishing an awareness of our offerings in those markets through a combination of direct marketing, web marketing, and participation in shows, conferences, and industry bodies. The marketing organization is responsible for maintaining our web site and creating electronic and print-based sales collateral to support our sales activities and lead generation.
 
COMPETITION
 
The market for telecommunications OSS products and mobile analytics and advertising is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, changing industry standards, regulatory developments and consolidation. We face increasing demand for improved product performance, enhanced functionality, rapid integration capabilities, all in the context of continuing pricing pressure. Our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies that often have substantially greater financial, technological, marketing, distribution and other resources, larger installed customer bases and longer-standing relationships with telecommunications customers. The market for telecommunications OSS software and services is extremely large and we currently hold only a small portion of total market share. Nonetheless, we believe our work in subscriber acquisition and activation and Digital Engagement Customer Value Management, Retention and Loyalty has resulted in our achieving a measurable and reasonable market share in those areas.
 
Our principal competitors for subscriber acquisition and activation are vendors such as Nokia, Amdocs and Huawei, as well as billing vendors and other vendors such as Ericsson, 6D, HP and a few other smaller regional competitors.
 
Competitors for Digital Engagement Customer Value Management, Retention and Loyalty, include specialist vendors such as Pontis (acquired by Amdocs), CRM software from vendors such as Amdocs Limited, Analytics software from vendors like SAS and a few independent software companies like FlyTxt and Pelatro.
 
For all of our products, our ability to compete successfully depends on a wide range of factors. First and foremost is our ability to deliver both marketing services and expert services based on our solutions platform, which offers a cost-effective way for our customers to benefit from our many years of experience and product investment. We deliver value by offering competitively priced quality solutions, tailored specifically to our customers network and IT infra-structure. After a customer implements our products, we often receive subsequent orders for enhancements to add functionality or increase capacity. Complex solutions tailored to customers needs are expensive and time consuming to replace, thus providing us with an incumbent advantage. Furthermore, many of our customer relationships span five years or more. We believe all of these factors give us a competitive advantage and can be a barrier to entry for potential competitors.
 
SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018 one significant customer accounted for 11% of revenue from operations. This customer is a large telecommunications operator in Europe. For the year ended December 31, 2017 one significant customer accounted for 11% of revenue from operations. This customer is a large telecommunications operator in Europe.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We have 9 patents in the U.S. on elements of our DSA and mobile broadband enablement products and patents pending in other countries on elements of our DSA and other products.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 280 people including 17 in the United States, 117 in the United Kingdom and European Union and 146 in India.
