Introduction
 
We were originally incorporated in June 2021 as a Delaware corporation under the name “Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp.” We were a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination with one or more target companies. On September 17, 2021 (the “IPO Closing Date”), we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO” or the “Public Offering”). On February 14, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated the previously announced Business Combination (as defined in the Explanatory Note to this Annual Report on Form 10-K) pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, by and among the Company, Merger Sub, Sponsor, in its capacity as purchaser representative, Legacy Ocean, and Dr. Chirinjeev Kathuria, in his capacity as seller representative. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, on the Closing Date, Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy Ocean, with Legacy Ocean continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name from “Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp.” to “Ocean Biomedical, Inc.”
Description of Business
 
We, Ocean Biomedical, are a biopharmaceutical company that seeks to bridge the “bench-to-bedside” gap between medical research discoveries and patient solutions. We do this by leveraging our strong relationships with research universities and medical centers to license their inventions and technologies with the goal of developing them into products that address diseases with significant unmet medical needs. We believe that our differentiated business model positions us to capture inventions created at these institutions that might otherwise fail to be commercialized to benefit patients. Our team of accomplished scientists, business professionals and entrepreneurs brings together the interdisciplinary expertise and resources required to develop and commercialize a diverse portfolio of assets. We are organized around a licensing and subsidiary structure that we believe will enable us to create mutual value for us and potential licensing partners. We believe this structure, combined with the networks of our leadership team, allows us to opportunistically build a continuous pipeline of promising product innovations through our existing and potential future relationships with research institutions. Our goal is to optimize value creation for each of our product candidates, and we intend to continuously assess the best pathway for each as it progresses through the preclinical and clinical development process—including through internal advancement, partnerships with established companies and spin-outs or initial public offerings—in order to benefit patients through the commercialization of these products. Our current active assets are licensed directly or indirectly from Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. Our scientific co-founders and members of our board of directors, Dr. Jack A. Elias and Dr. Jonathan Kurtis, are both affiliated with Brown University and with Rhode Island Hospital.
Our Pipeline
 
Our pipeline consists of preclinical programs. We anticipate moving certain preclinical product candidates in our oncology, fibrosis and/or infectious disease platforms, all licensed exclusively from Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital, into the clinic in the next 12 to 18 months.

Our programs in oncology and fibrosis are based on discoveries of disease pathways and of related drug targets emerging from pioneering work in the field of chitinase biology by our scientific co-founder and member of our board of directors, Jack A. Elias, M.D., former Dean of Medicine and current Special Advisor for Health Affairs to Brown University.
 
In oncology, our product candidates are based on Dr. Elias’ findings that a protein called chitinase 3-like-1, or Chi3l1, is a key driver of multiple disease pathways, including those involved in primary and metastatic tumor development. In animal models of both lung cancer and glioblastoma, inhibition of Chi3l1 resulted in significant tumor reduction, and the reduction was even greater when the inhibition of Chi3l1 was combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are used as immuno-therapies to stimulate the body’s immune response against cancer. Neutralizing antibodies against Chi3l1 have been developed that are highly avid, specific, react with mouse, human and monkey Chi3l1 and are effectively expressed and humanized. We are developing a mono-specific antibody, or mAb, and two bi-specific monoclonal antibodies, or BsAbs, product candidates targeting Chi3l1 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, which affects approximately 460,000 people in the United States, and of glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, a usually lethal form of brain cancer that affects approximately 28,000 people in the United States. The median survival for individuals diagnosed with GBM is approximately 15 months and the five year survival rate is just 8% for those aged 45-54 and 5% for those aged 55-64.
 
Our product candidate in fibrosis is based on a drug target investigated by Dr. Elias and closely related to the Chi3l1 oncology target described above. Dr. Elias found that an enzyme called chitinase 1, or Chit1, is a key driver of fibrosis. Fibrosis is observed in an estimated 50% of all diseases. Fibrosis in the lungs tends to be progressive and can reduce their function. In animal models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, or HPS, inhibition of Chit1 showed statistically significant reduced levels of fibrotic markers. We are developing a small molecule product candidate targeting Chit1 for the treatment of IPF, a debilitating lung disease affecting approximately 160,000 people in the United States, and of HPS, an ultra-rare disease affecting approximately 1,800 in the United States.
 
In infectious diseases we are developing therapeutic and vaccine candidates against malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that kills 500,000 children under the age of five globally each year, that infects 200-300 million people annually worldwide, and for which 3.4 billion people worldwide are at risk. Our product candidates in malaria are based on the discovery by Jonathan Kurtis, M.D., Ph.D., Chair of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Director of the M.D./Ph.D. Program at Brown University, of two novel malaria antigens, PfSEA-1 and PfGARP (as defined below). In non-human primate models of malaria, vaccination with PfGARP resulted in an 11.5-fold reduction of parasites in blood compared to controls. In in-vitro models, our therapeutic antibody candidate against PfGARP reduced parasite count by 99% compared to controls. We have three product candidates based on these new antigens: (1) a malaria vaccine candidate against PfSEA-1 and/or against PfGARP; (2) a humanized mAb malaria product candidate against PfGARP; and (3) a small molecule malaria product candidate, also against PfGARP.
 
Importantly, Dr. Kurtis’ antigen discoveries described above were enabled by his development of our Whole Proteome Differential Screening target discovery platform (the “WPDS” platform). We believe the WPDS platform may enable us to discover new targets for other infectious diseases in the future. The WPDS platform leverages the fact that the immune system, when exposed to an infectious disease such as malaria, will often naturally produce a wide array of antibodies to try fighting the infection. Only a small subset of these antibodies may prove effective, and the WPDS platform is designed to identify these antibodies and their corresponding antigens. We believe that such antibodies and antigens could inform the development of therapeutic and/or vaccine candidates against the particular infectious disease. Prior to in-licensing our product candidates, the preclinical developments of the oncology, fibrosis and malaria programs described above have, to date, been funded through grants to our licensors totaling $105.6 million.

Our Team
 
Our scientific co-founders and members of our board of directors are Dr. Elias and Dr. Kurtis. Our executive chairman and co-founder is Chirinjeev Kathuria, M.D., an investor and entrepreneur who has co-founded and driven the initial public offerings, or IPOs, of companies in various industries including healthcare. Our chief executive officer, Elizabeth Ng, brings a proven track record of building successful portfolios in biopharma companies including Merck & Co., Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Our team brings expertise in science, medicine, agile drug development, pharma strategy, and innovation management. Collectively, members of the team have evaluated more than 3,500 innovations; been involved in more than 80 drug discovery / development programs, 17 clinical development programs, and 8 approved drugs; have secured more than $120 million in venture capital funding; and have been involved in the launch of 8 biotech or life sciences companies and 3 IPOs. In addition, beyond our day-to-day leadership team, our scientific co-founders and members of our scientific advisory board and board of directors, Dr. Elias and Dr. Kurtis, have authored or co-authored more than 350 papers, secured more than $110 million in grant funding, and are listed as inventors in more than 50 patents.
Our Strategy and Competitive Strengths
 
Our goal is to facilitate the flow of academic discoveries from bench-to-bedside by efficiently carrying out the translational and clinical development required to advance them commercially. The number of potential opportunities at research universities and medical centers is large (in 2018 they filed over 26,000 invention disclosures and spent over $71 billion in research) but only a small fraction of these opportunities is currently tapped by venture capitalists or pharmaceutical companies. There is a growing yet still small number of accelerator programs and incubators aiming to bridge the bench-to-bedside gap at specific institutions; however, the gap remains wide and we believe this presents an attractive opportunity for us to become an industry leader by addressing a need to accelerate the advancement of therapeutics that can address significant unmet medical needs.
 
The core elements that we believe differentiate our business model include:
 

● | Harnessing inventions and technologies from research universities and medical centers. We search for opportunities wherever they can be found, and we believe “hidden gems” can be uncovered by our team. We are experienced at identifying and sourcing breakthrough discoveries at academic and research institutions, including our current partnerships with Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. We know how to assess and test their scientific merits and commercial relevance, and we have extensive experience working with these institutions and licensing their assets. For example, our leadership team has evaluated thousands of innovations, taken multiple products through IND filings and into clinical development, and been involved in the launch of 8 biotech companies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Developing new drug therapies through an operationally efficient, evidence-based and milestone-driven approach. Once we select an asset for development, we pursue what we believe are appropriate development strategies that we aim to execute efficiently by leveraging contract research and contract manufacturing organizations, or CROs and CMOs, respectively, and other drug development experts and consultants. We aim to rapidly and efficiently advance our product candidates to objective critical decision points. We direct resources toward the opportunities that we believe are the most promising, and we discontinue programs that do not meet our performance thresholds. We are skilled at objectively directing internal resources, and at leveraging external resources (such as CROs and CMOs), in order to progress product candidates in accordance with well-defined criteria for advancement within a lean cost structure.
● | Building a diverse portfolio of product candidates. We are evidence-based and program agnostic, meaning that our resources are driven strictly by program progress and milestone achievements. Our approach is to develop multiple diverse programs in parallel. Our success is not dependent on any one particular program, disease area or indication, which mitigates business risk, and allows us the flexibility to opportunistically develop product candidates, regardless of therapeutic area. We believe that this model ensures that we remain focused on assets with the most promise. The unifying theme in our portfolio is to address significant unmet medical needs by commercializing innovative therapeutic products, if approved. 
● | Providing attractive economic upside to our partners at research universities and medical centers. We have a structure wherein Ocean Biomedical houses each of its programs in a subsidiary. We believe this structure is optimal to provide attractive economic incentives to the discovering institution and its researchers. Our subsidiary structure is intended to enable us to offer equity in future programs to the licensing institution and the researchers who discover our product candidates. We believe this structure will make us a partner of choice for both institutions and researchers and aligns our interests with theirs toward the goal of maximum returns. 
● | Employing a multi-disciplinary approach to drug discovery and development across our programs. Our business model is based on bringing together the appropriate disciplines and expertise needed for each of our programs and leveraging learnings across programs and disease areas. Common ties between many diseases are becoming apparent and similar therapeutic strategies are increasingly being applied to different diseases. For example, our oncology and fibrosis programs are both based upon chitinase biology. Another example is the confluence of thinking about immunology and oncology therapeutic approaches which led to the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors. 
● | Exploiting multiple commercialization options to maximize each program’s value. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we continually assess that program’s potential paths to market, and we will endeavor to maximize commercial value through various options, including internal advancement, partnerships with established companies, and spin-outs or IPOs. We believe that our structure and operational strategy enables us to assess and pursue the course that maximizes outcomes for patients and value for our shareholders. 
● | Leadership team comprised of academic, scientific and business innovators. We have assembled an industry-leading, multi-disciplinary team consisting of physicians, scientists and business leaders with significant experience in progressing product candidates from early-stage research through clinical trials, regulatory approval and ultimately to commercialization. 

 
We believe our differentiated business model enables us to advance the commercialization of our products, if approved, and will allow us to replicate our licensing partnerships through aligned incentive structures with research universities and medical centers.

Feeding our Pipeline: Harnessing Innovations from Research Centers
 
Our innovative business model is aimed at translating biomedical inventions from research universities and medical centers into products that we believe have the potential to dramatically improve patients’ lives. Unlike many biotech companies, our success is not dependent on any one particular program or disease. Our current pipeline is already well-diversified and our access to innovations from academic and medical institutions allows us the flexibility to opportunistically develop product candidates, regardless of therapeutic area. We believe our sources of medical discoveries include not only research universities and medical centers but also companies with assets that are not core to their business model.
 
We use highly selective criteria and stringent due diligence for selecting assets for development. Picking the right assets requires unbiased and objective science/technology and market assessments that are not affected by institutional legacies, not blinded by research myopia or academic necessities, and not influenced by “herd mentalities.” We seek to develop technologies that meet our stringent selection criteria and which are amenable to our controlled de-risking process that we believe can lead to clear and timely value inflection points and milestones. We intend to keep our focus on projects and technologies that demonstrate clear progress towards becoming commercially viable products. Our business model aims to diversify our approach away from a single vector of technology research or science, and instead to pursue a variety of promising research avenues simultaneously and cost effectively. As explained previously, we believe that we can address the resourcing challenges inherent in such diversity and that the diversity itself is an advantageous business strategy.
 
Our model for identifying, structuring and developing assets is based on the following tenets:
 

● | We believe we have a disciplined process for identification, selection and prioritization of programs: We believe that only well-defined science can be monetized successfully. Independent analyses of pharmaceutical research and development productivity indicate that ill-defined science is a major cause of low success rates and eventual failure of programs. We believe that there is no substitute for a thorough science/technology assessment upfront as it is essential to have a clear understanding of the science and a clear vision of how a technology becomes a product before starting the development effort. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our approach to selecting programs is opportunistic: We seek opportunities based on solid science, well-characterized drug mechanisms of action, and targets with true disease-modifying potential that can address significant unmet medical needs. While many such opportunities may be found at leading universities and medical centers, we search for promising technologies wherever they can be found. We believe that such technologies can be located at institutions across the world. We are open to evaluating programs at any stage of development. We are purposely opportunistic and agnostic as to therapeutic area. Our strategy is to bring the appropriate and the most current expertise to bear as needed for each program.


● | We aim for efficient therapeutic development operations: Once we select an asset for development, we leverage our years of experience in drug development to create appropriate development strategies. We aim to execute such strategies efficiently by leveraging CROs and other drug development experts and consultants. The development process is managed by our experienced team with support from leaders and experts in the relevant disease areas. We aim to rapidly and efficiently advance our product candidates to objective critical decision points. We direct resources toward the opportunities that we believe are the most promising, and we discontinue programs that do not meet performance thresholds. Each development program is carried forward with what we believe to be the right balance of effort from our centralized resources and personnel, through which we share certain support functions across various programs, combined with specialist external providers as appropriate. This combination is designed to ensure that each program has the appropriate level and type of resources required to execute its unique development strategy while minimizing fixed costs at the program level.

● | We believe our structure supports our strategic aims: We are structured in a manner where Ocean Biomedical currently houses each program in a wholly-owned subsidiary. This structure is designed to leverage a main feature of our business model in which each program is derived from our acquisition of a license to assets from a research university or similar institution. This structure is intended to allow us to provide attractive economic incentives to the institution and its relevant investigators. We intend in the future, as new programs are licensed in by us, to grant a certain percentage of the ownership in the new subsidiaries we create for such programs, targeting 20% in aggregate, to the institution and to the researchers. This model is also designed to align our interests with those of our partners and to facilitate our access to the particular program’s scientific expertise and know-how. We believe this approach will make us the partner of choice or licensee of choice for institutions and researchers because we aim to act with greater speed and to provide better potential upside when compared to pharmaceutical companies or venture-backed biotechnology companies with whom the institution might also consider partnering.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe that our diversified pipeline approach provides us with meaningful advantages: Unlike biotechnology companies that are focused on a narrow set of assets, on a single platform, or on a particular therapeutic area, we are advancing a diverse portfolio of several programs in parallel. In so doing, we aim to avoid the duplication of resources, the extra costs and the lack of valuable cross-pollination that would likely exist if each program were pursued as independent assets. We are evidence-based and program agnostic, where deployment of program resources are driven strictly by program progress and milestone achievements. We believe that our diverse, multi-program business model and our access to a robust pipeline of opportunities helps us to remain focused on the most promising assets. We believe this focus differentiates us advantageously from biotech companies that, by purposely being focused, have bet their fortunes on a limited number of programs. 
● | We aim to create optionality for maximum impact and value creation in each program: Throughout the development of any program we continuously assess that program’s potential paths to market and monetization. We anticipate that such paths may include: (a) taking a candidate all the way through to potential approval and product launch via internal funding; (b) externalizing development with a strategic partner that we believe is better suited to progress a program; and (c) spinning out or taking a candidate’s subsidiary public. We believe that our structure and operational strategy enables us to objectively assess and choose the option that maximizes potential value for patients and for our shareholders. 

Our Structure: Supporting Innovation


We are structured in a manner where Ocean Biomedical houses each program in a subsidiary. We currently house our programs in four wholly-owned subsidiaries and intend to grant a certain percentage of the ownership in future subsidiaries, typically 20% in aggregate, to the institution and to the relevant researchers. This anticipated organizational structure for future subsidiaries is unique in the market and we believe it will make us the partner of choice for institutions and inventors.
 
Currently, research universities and medical centers (institutions) have two primary options to commercialize their biomedical innovations and technologies: licensing to pharma, or licensing to startups that are usually founded or co-founded by the researchers (the inventors) behind the innovations. Most commonly, the IP policy of U.S. institutions specifies that economic value received from licenses is split equally among the institution, the individual inventor(s), and their department or school.
 
Licensing to a large pharmaceutical company is appealing due to the vast resources it may employ to pursue commercial development and the potential for large up-front and milestone payments. However, these companies often only license innovations later in their development. Therefore, licenses to large pharmaceutical companies are relatively rare.
 
Researchers often choose to license their innovations to startups because (i) they see greater economic upside (as compared to only receiving a fraction of what their institution receives), (ii) they view a startup as a way to retain more control over the development of their innovation and (iii) a startup may be the only option given the challenges of licensing to larger companies. The researcher typically takes a non-operating role as a scientific founder of the startup, and holds between a 10% and 20% equity stake in the enterprise, which will be subject to dilution over time.



11
--


We can provide the resources and capital of a pharma licensee while also providing the more compelling economic upsides of a startup. Each patent portfolio that we license in from an institution (capturing the discoveries of one or more researchers) are housed, or in the future will be housed in a separate unit or subsidiary which we title a ‘program’. We can provide the institution and the researchers a share in the potential economic upside of that particular program regardless of how that economic upside comes about. The proposed share we envision is a 20% total in such subsidiaries – with approximately 10% to the institution and approximately 10% to the researchers, a significantly higher stake than they would typically be able to hold in a startup venture.
 
We believe institutions and their researchers will prefer Ocean Biomedical to launching a startup because Ocean Biomedical eliminates the challenge of needing to raise capital and hire a team, and provides a greater share in the upside. Likewise, we believe Ocean Biomedical will be a preferred choice as opposed to licensing to large pharmaceutical companies because receiving a percentage of any economic value, regardless of how it is derived, is often more attractive than relying on fixed milestone payments or single-digit royalties.
 
We believe our approach will give us preferred access to innovations at research universities and medical centers, and that this in turn will benefit our shareholders.
 
Our Pipeline Funnel Process
 
Our core competencies for acquiring and developing pipeline programs include: (1) identifying, assessing and selecting inventions and technologies (from research universities and medical centers) that we may directly or indirectly license and commercialize; (2) in-licensing selected inventions and technologies; and (3) developing those inventions and technologies into potential therapeutic products aimed at addressing unmet medical needs.
Step One: New Program Identification, Assessment and Selection
 
Our close relationships with research universities and medical centers, along with their individual researchers, technology transfer offices, accelerator programs and entrepreneurship centers, provide us with access to biomedical inventions and technologies that we may directly or indirectly license and commercialize. Our multi-disciplinary Opportunity Assessment Committee, or OAC, is responsible for new program identification, assessment and selection – and for ensuring adherence to our due diligence process. The OAC is expected to be comprised of Dr. Jonathan Kurtis (Scientific Co-founder), Elizabeth Ng (Chief Executive Officer), Daniel Behr (Executive Vice President, Head of External Innovation and Academic Partnerships and Secretary), Sharon Talcott (Vice President of Strategic Partnerships), and Gurinder Kalra (Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer). The OAC applies our disciplined and rigorous due diligence process to identify, assess quantitatively, and select those inventions and technologies based on criteria we believe ensures that each asset selected to enter our pipeline is consistent with our mission and commercialization objectives. Our criteria are listed below, and we score and weigh each criterion through a combination of data analytics, experience and judgment.

● | Robust and verifiable science that can lead to predictable outcomes 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Well-characterized mechanisms with potential to be disease modifying 
● | Development path with timely and achievable milestones / value inflection points 
● | Solid and dominating intellectual property / patent position 


● | Knowledge transfer assuredness (inventors available and approachable) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Potential for multiple products / applications 
● | Potential to address significant unmet medical needs 
● | Product advantages that are “must-haves” for patients, practitioners, and payors 
● | Manufacturing and scale-up feasibility 
● | Attractive market / competitive dynamics 
● | Favorable pricing and reimbursement with good gross margin potential

Step Two: Executing License Agreements
 
After a new program is selected via the process outlined above, or in some cases as part of the selection process, we endeavor to negotiate and execute a license agreement with the relevant university or medical center. Our team has negotiated and executed dozens of such license agreements, both as licensee and as licensor.
 
As mentioned previously, we believe our business model may make us the ‘licensee of choice’ for institutions and researchers because we aim to act with greater speed and to provide better potential upside when compared to the companies or spin-out startups to whom the institution might also consider licensing. In particular, by housing each program in a subsidiary, we can grant a certain percentage of that subsidiary’s ownership (targeting 20% in aggregate) to the institution and to the relevant researchers. We believe that receiving such percentage of economic value, regardless of how it is derived, will be more attractive to the institution than relying on the fixed milestone payments and single-digit royalties that are customary in other license agreements. Additionally, we believe that individual researchers will find it more attractive to have a direct stake in a program’s economic value as opposed to receiving a share (typically one third) of whatever economic value their institution would receive in customary license agreements. Lastly, we believe institutions and their researchers will prefer our approach over launching a startup because we eliminate the challenge of raising venture capital and securing a team, and because the percent equity ownership we can offer is likely to be higher than the single-digit figures that usually result after the typical dilution in startups.
 
By offering a percentage ownership in a program’s subsidiary in lieu of the alternative license fees, milestone payments and royalties, we believe our license agreements (and the associated negotiation) will be greatly simplified while also being more attractive to our licensors and their individual researchers.
 
Step Three: Product Development, and Commercialization
 
We are an asset-focused company with an operating model designed for agile, capital efficient, and scalable therapeutic product development. We have a structure wherein Ocean Biomedical houses each drug development program or therapeutic platform in a subsidiary. Each of these programs may include multiple product candidates or assets. This structure helps to ensure that we align interests and that we gain access to the particular program’s scientific expertise and know-how. The results and outcomes of one subsidiary do not directly affect others, and because our subsidiaries (or assets) are decoupled, success is not dependent on any one particular asset. We can thereby evaluate each asset’s preclinical, translational and clinical development progress objectively, which we believe enables us to allocate resources and capital throughout our portfolio based on each asset’s evidence-based progress and continued scientific and commercial merits. The continued merits of an asset are periodically assessed using some or all of the criteria outlined above which we use to assess potential new programs. We are agnostic as to which assets deliver success and believe this allows us to maintain focus on those which continue to show most potential.
 
Our product development and commercialization process reflects the disciplined and objective asset-centric philosophy described above. This process has the following features:
 

● | Evidence-based and science-driven decision making at each stage of translational and clinical development: For each product candidate, key milestones or decision points are set based on their ability to validate technical and commercial viability, and feasibility, as viewed from industry and regulatory lenses. We support each product candidate with the interdisciplinary expertise and resources to reach these key decision points. We review progress on an on-going basis and constantly re-assess whether the program warrants continued investment – i.e., we recognize the dynamic nature of these product candidates and we re-evaluate them based on development progress, risk factors, and market dynamics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lean and agile translational development operations: Each program is managed by our centralized team of experienced product development leaders who enlist the support of relevant external resources including CROs, CMOs, domain experts, consultants, etc. We believe this approach is most cost-effective for clinical and commercial development and that it allows us to minimize overhead while giving us the flexibility to tap into the most relevant and current talent for each program without having to rely on large teams of permanent hires.

In addition, our Research Review Committee, or RRC, which is expected to be comprised of Dr. Jack A. Elias (Scientific Co-founder), Dr. Jonathan Kurtis (Scientific Co-founder), Elizabeth Ng (Chief Executive Officer), and Dr. Inderjote Kathuria (Chief Strategy Officer) will be responsible for the research, translational and preclinical efforts leading to filing an IND and moving a product candidate into human clinical trials.
 
Our Development Review Committee, or DRC, which is expected to be comprised of Dr. Jonathan Kurtis (Scientific Co-founder), Elizabeth Ng (Chief Executive Officer), and Inderjote Kathuria (Chief Strategy Officer) will be responsible for managing all clinical development efforts, including progress monitoring, allocation of resources, and continuous re-evaluation of a product candidate’s merits.
 
Both these committees will work in collaboration with our OAC described previously to ensure that each product candidate that enters our pipeline as well as existing ones continue to meet the criteria we have outlined above.
 
Our Therapeutic Programs
 
Oncology Product Candidates for NSCLC and GBM
 
Our oncology product candidates for NSCLC and GBM:
 

● | OCX-253 anti-Chi3l1 Single-target mAb (NSCLC) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------
● | OCX-410 anti-Chi3l1/PD-1 Bi-specific antibody (NSCLC) 
● | OCX-909 anti-Chi3l1/CTLA-4 Bi-specific antibody (GBM) 

 
Our product candidates in our oncology program are based on a drug target pioneered by Dr. Elias. His research demonstrated that a protein called chitinase 3-like-1, or Chi3l1, is a key driver of multiple disease pathways in primary and metastatic tumor development demonstrating an 85-95% reduction in primary and metastatic tumor burden in multiple animal models. Animal models of lung cancer and glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, showed that inhibition of Chi3l1 resulted in statistically significant tumor reduction – even more so when combined with immunotherapies to stimulate the body’s own immune response against cancer. Our oncology development pipeline consists of: (a) an antibody therapeutic product candidate inhibiting Chi3l1; (b) a bi-specific antibody product candidate inhibiting Chi3l1 plus PD-1, a checkpoint inhibitor protein; and (c) a bi-specific antibody product candidate inhibiting Chi3l1 plus CTLA-4, another checkpoint inhibitor protein. These product candidates are targeting non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, which accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers globally and affects about 460,000 people in the United States and 595,000 people in Europe, and glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, a brain cancer that kills approximately 60% of patients within 12 to 18 months from the time of diagnosis and for which new treatment therapies are needed.
 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
 
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, accounting for 2.1 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths in 2018. In the United States, lung cancer is the third most common and the deadliest malignancy. Approximately 541,000 people in the United States today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point in their lives. It is estimated that 229,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States, representing about 13% of all cancer diagnoses. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of new lung cancer cases.

NSCLC continues to rank among the cancers with the lowest five-year survival rates and has one of the largest disease burdens in terms of disability-adjusted life years.
 
Staging is a way of describing the severity and extent of a cancer’s growth and spread. The stage of NSCLC is based on a combination of several factors, including the size and location of the primary tumor and whether it has spread to the lymph nodes and/or other parts of the body.
 
There are five stages for NSCLC: stage 0 and stages I through IV. In general, an earlier stage of NSCLC is linked with a better outcome. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of patients, in the order of 40% to 50%, are still diagnosed with hard-to-treat stage IV disease.
 
There are currently five main ways to treat NSCLC: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. The use of these treatment options for NSCLC is based mainly on the stage of the cancer, but other factors, such as a person’s overall health and lung function, as well as certain traits of the cancer itself, such as its molecular characteristics, are also important.
 
Treatment decisions often follow either formal or informal guidelines. Treatment options can be ranked or prioritized into lines of therapy: first-line therapy, second-line therapy, third-line therapy, and so on. First-line therapy, sometimes called induction therapy, primary therapy or front-line therapy, is the first therapy that will likely be attempted. If a first-line therapy either fails to produce sufficient antitumor response or produces intolerable side effects, additional therapies may be substituted or added to the treatment regimen, known as second-line or third-line treatments. Often, multiple therapies may be administered simultaneously, known as combination therapy or polytherapy.
 
Surgery is usually the first choice for early stage disease followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Targeted therapies and immunotherapy are the main options in advanced disease, in stages III and IV.
 
Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets the cancer’s specific genes, proteins or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival. This type of treatment blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells and limits damage to healthy cells.
 
Immunotherapy is designed to boost the body’s natural antitumor immune defenses. Lung cancers often contain genetic mutations that are seen as “non-self” by the host’s immune system because they are not seen in normal cells and tissues. The human immune system is designed to attack and eliminate cells and tissues that it detects as foreign or “non-self.” However, in many patients with cancer these desired antitumor responses are suppressed by the tumor and surrounding cells. This is done by activating one of a number of immune checkpoint inhibitor pathways, or ICPI pathways.
 
An example of the multiple ICPI pathways that have been discovered that has received significant attention in lung cancer is the programmed death-1/ PD-ligand 1, or PD-1/PD-L1, pathway. In many patients with lung cancer, the immune cells and nearby cells, such as macrophages express, PD-1 and the tumor cells express its binding partner PD-L1. When PD-L1 binds PD-1, it activates pathways that suppress the host’s antitumor immune response. On the other hand, therapeutics (usually antibodies) have been developed that prevent these PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. These therapies boost the host’s antitumor responses which augments its ability to attack the tumor. Because there are multiple ICPI pathways, assays that determine which pathway(s) is activated in a given tumor have been and are being developed. This allows the therapeutic intervention to be directed to the ICPI pathway that is most important in a given individual.
 
Importantly, immunotherapy has been generally regarded as revolutionizing the treatment of NSCLC, with immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway now emerging as standard-of-care in some settings. However, despite the advent of these new therapies for NSCLC, there continues to be a need for other therapeutic options because only approximately 15% of patients respond to these interventions. In addition, among those that initially improve, the responses are often not durable and diminish over time. In many cases, tumors evolve compensatory mechanisms that circumvent the beneficial effects of an individual immunotherapy. Thus, a significant unmet medical need in NSCLC are treatment options that either restore or complement, the efficacy of anti PD-1 / PD-L1 and other ICPI-based therapies.

A general overview of immunotherapy and antibodies is presented below under the caption “A Primer on Antibodies, Antigens and Targeted Therapies.”
 
We believe that OCX-253, our mono-specific mAb against Chi3l1, if approved, will likely be used individually or in combination with immunotherapies, such as anti-PD-1 therapeutics. Our belief is based on the observation that OCX-253 modulates multiple oncogenic pathways, or signaling networks used by cancer cells to control the growth and progression of tumors, in addition to its ability to modulate ICPI pathways. Should OCX-253 become a marketed treatment, we would anticipate it being initially used primarily in later-stage cancers, as with most recently approved oncology therapeutics. OCX-253 may progress towards being used for earlier stage cancers, and/or in combination with other medications, as clinician and regulatory agency experience with the drug grows and as our understanding of the needs of individual patients deepens.
 
OCX-410, our bi-specific antibody, is designed to combine the mechanism of actions of OCX-253 and anti-PD-1 therapeutics. We believe this is a promising combination because studies by Dr. Elias have demonstrated that this bi-specific antibody recruits immune cells, such as CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that kill tumor cells, and the physical interaction of these activated T cells to tumor cell membranes. If approved, we anticipate that OCX-410 will likely enter the market as a second-line therapy in patients with stage III or IV lung cancer who have failed anti PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapies. We believe that OCX-410 may eventually be used as a first-line treatment for patients with later stage NSCLC.
 
Glioblastoma Multiforme
 
GBM is an aggressive type of cancer that can occur in the brain or spinal cord, the components of the central nervous system, or CNS, and is the most common brain tumor in adults. GBMs are a type of astrocytoma, meaning that they arise from the star-shaped cells, known as astrocytes, in the CNS. Normally, these cells form a key component of the blood brain barrier, or BBB, a network of cells, proteins, and structural components that controls which substances can get into the central nervous system, or CNS, and which cannot. Astrocytes also normally help support nerve cells and carry nutrients to them.
 
Brain tumors are graded on an I to IV scale based on how fast they grow. Grade I brain tumors are the least aggressive. They grow very slowly and rarely spread into nearby tissues. Grade IV are the most aggressive. GBMs are grade IV astrocytomas. They grow quickly and often spread into nearby brain tissue. They rarely metastasize or spread to other parts of the body.
 
GBM is a rare disease, with a prevalence of 1-9 out of 100,000 individuals. The prevalence in the United States is estimated to be approximately 28,000 diagnosed individuals, and the annual incidence is estimated to be between 6,000 and 10,000. Primary GBM accounts for 90% of cases, mostly occurring in older individuals, while secondary GBM develops more slowly and occurs in relatively younger patients.
 
No curative therapies exist for GBM and the treatment landscape has not changed in recent years. A significant proportion, approximately 25%, of the GBM prevalent population is not actively treated due to rapid disease progression and an extremely poor prognosis. Surgery is standard-of-care followed by radiation and follow-up with chemo. If that does not work, then physicians may try a second line approach, such as switching chemo monotherapies. However, these second line therapies are rarely effective.
 
Our bispecific antibody candidate, OCX-909, is designed to combine the mechanism of actions of OCX-253 with an anti-CTLA-4 component. CTLA-4 is a protein receptor that functions as an immune checkpoint that binds to molecules called B7.1 and B7.2 to suppress antitumor immune responses in a manner similar to PD-1. We believe OCX-909 may produce antitumor response particularly in GBM because CTLA-4 is expressed in an exaggerated manner in many GBM tumors. If approved, we envision OCX-909 being potentially utilized as an alternative to surgery, or in the treatment regimen in both the neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery) settings for patients with GBM.

A Primer on Antibodies, Antigens and Targeted Therapies
 
One way the body’s immune system attacks foreign substances is by making large numbers of antibodies. An antibody is a protein that binds to a specific antigen. An antigen is a molecule that is foreign to the human body; examples include viruses, bacteria, and tumor cells.
 
Antibodies have a distinct “Y” shape. Each upper arm of the “Y” is uniquely structured to bind to a specific part of a particular antigen, called an epitope. Once bound to the antigen, an antibody triggers other parts of the immune system to destroy the cells containing the antigen.
 
Monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, are antibodies that are designed and made as therapeutics to bind to specific antigen targets such as those present in a particular type of cancer cell, virus, or other pathogen. When mAbs are used in this manner they are referred to as targeted therapies. Therapeutic antibodies can also be engineered to recognize two epitopes simultaneously, making them “bispecific.” Bispecific antibodies, or BsAbs, can bind directly to surface antigens to kill the cells containing the antigens and they can also help ramp up the immune system to make it more effective against those cells.
 
The Chitinase Biology Behind Our Oncology Project Candidates
 
Dr. Elias has focused a significant amount of his research over the last decade on a gene family called the 18 glycosyl hydrolases and its chitinase and chitinase-like proteins, or CLP. The chitinases and CLP both bind chitin, a polysaccharide that is a major structural component of the exoskeletons of insects and other arthropods and the cell walls of fungi. The chitinases are true enzymes that cleave chitin into smaller saccharide units. In contrast, the CLPs bind to but do not cleave chitin.
 
Chitin, Chitinases, and Chitinase-Like-Proteins
 

Chitinase-3-like-1, or Chi3l1, also known as YKL-40, the prototypic CLP, was initially described as a soluble product of an osteosarcoma cell line and has since been found in several different laboratory cell lines and animal tissues. In humans, Chi3l1 is found on the cell surface, inside cells and in the circulation. It plays a major role in tissue injury, inflammation, tissue repair and remodeling responses in healthy individuals. It is produced by a variety of cells including epithelial cells and macrophages in response to cytokines, lipids, oxidant injury and other stimuli. It then feeds back to inhibit tissue injury by inhibiting cell death and apoptosis while stimulating fibroproliferative repair.
 
The levels of circulating and tissue Chi3l1 are increased in many human visceral cancers and animal tumor models including lung cancer and glioblastoma. In visceral tumors elevated serum levels of Chi3l1 correlate with a poor prognosis and shorter disease-free intervals and survival. Studies in animal models have also demonstrated that the inhibition of Chi3l1 can dramatically reduce tumor burden. Consequently, Chi3l1 is now appreciated to be a sensitive biomarker and an attractive therapeutic target for these malignancies. We intend to take advantage of both of these properties because the inhibition of Chi3l1 is a major focus in OCX-253, —410 and —909, and we intend to use Chi311’s properties as a biomarker to identify relevant populations for clinical trials of these product candidates.

Chi3l1 interacts with several different cell-surface proteins to mediate its cell and tissue responses. Studies by Dr. Elias and others have demonstrated that Chi3l1 binds to and signals via a number of cell surface receptors (proteins that pass signals between the outside and inside of cells) including the interleukin-13 receptor-α 2 and CRTH2. They have also demonstrated that IL-13Rα2 is the alpha subunit of multimeric receptor complexes that can include galectin 3 and CD44 as ß subunits. Chi3l1 can also interact with receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins αVß3 and αVß5 / syndecan 1 complexes, and the receptor for advanced glycation end products. These receptors activate a number of signaling pathways including MAPK kinases, Protein Kinase B/Akt and the Wnt/ß-catenin pathways and induce the production of VEGF intermediaries. As a result of these complex receptor-ligand interactions it is now known that Chi3l1 regulates oncogenesis via a number of mechanisms. Dr. Elias has demonstrated that Chi3l1 stimulates malignant responses by inhibiting tumor cell death, stimulating tumor cell proliferation, stimulating the B-Raf protooncogene, and stimulating the phosphorylation of cofilin. He has demonstrated that Chi3l1 also inhibits key antineoplastic pathways including those mediated by the tumor suppressors phosphatase and tensin homolog, or PTEN, and p53 thereby removing intracellular controls against unregulated cell growth. These molecules taken together form the tumor microenvironment, a localized set of conditions that supports the evolution and growth of tumors.
 
In summary, Chi3l1 contributes to neoplasia, or the uncontrolled and abnormal growth of cells or tissues that is the hallmark of cancer, by regulating various pro- and anti-oncogenic pathways as shown in the illustration below:
 
Chi3l1 and its Roles in Disease Biology
 

Dr. Elias and other investigators have also found a direct link between Chit1 and fibrotic diseases, such as IPF and HPS. This finding is the basis for our anti-Chit1 small molecule therapeutic product candidate, OCF-203, detailed later.

OCX-253—Anti-Chi3l1 mAb for Lung Cancer
 
Recent published studies have demonstrated that the levels of circulating Chi3l1 are elevated in many malignancies including cancers of the prostate, colon, rectum, ovary, kidney, breast, as well as GBM and malignant melanoma. In these diseases, the levels of Chi3l1 frequently correlate directly with disease progression and inversely with disease-free interval and survival. This is particularly striking in lung cancer where preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated that the serum and tissue levels of Chi3l1 are increased and are associated with adverse outcomes, such as poor prognosis and shorter survival. Dr Elias and colleagues have found that Chi3l1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of primary and metastatic lung cancer in murine models that have the same genetic mutations that are seen in human disease including activating mutations of the K-Ras oncogene. In murine models primary lung cancer is induced in mice that have activating mutations of Kras (the G12 D mutation) and null mutations of the tumor suppressor p53. Dr Elias and colleagues have additionally demonstrated that Chi3l1 is able to replace null mutations of p53 in the generation of primary lung cancer in murine models that only have activating mutations of the K-Ras oncogene. They also demonstrated that Chi3l1 is induced during pulmonary melanoma and pulmonary breast cancer metastasis in murine models of these diseases and that Chi3l1 induction is required for the generation of a metastasis permissive pulmonary microenvironment. As shown below, both primary tumor growth and metastatic spread were both significantly inhibited via immune inhibition of Chi3l1 using therapeutic antibodies (Fig. 1). These antibody findings are the basis for Ocean Biomedical’s OCX-253 program in NSCLC. We plan to initially focus on a subset of patients who exhibit elevated levels of circulating Chi3l1 as they are anticipated to be the patient population most likely to respond to this product candidate. However, the treatable patient population may eventually expand as a consequence of the many critical pathways OCX-253 appears to impact (as described and shown in the figure above) and as our understanding of chitinase biology grows.

OCX-410 and OCX-909—Anti-Chi3l1/PD-1 and Anti-Chi3l1/CTLA-4 Bispecific Antibodies for NSCLC and GBM
 
Novel immunotherapeutic approaches have improved the prognosis for a number of cancers over the past decade. Cancer cells have unstable genomes and as a result accumulate genetic mutations that are not seen in normal cells and tissues. These non-self mutations generate non-self proteins that can be recognized and reacted to by the immune system. Normal white blood cells, particularly T lymphocytes, learn to recognize these novel antigens and kill the cells that express them. Under normal circumstances, immune responses are activated to deal with pathogens and non-self antigens but are then inhibited to prevent overexuberant, injury-inducing, immune responses. This immune inhibition is often mediated by immune checkpoint inhibitor pathways. Unfortunately, some tumors evolve to take advantage of these regulatory pathways to evade endogenous antitumor immune responses. For example, tumor cells may produce the regulatory protein cell death ligand 1, or PD-L1 or cluster of differentiation proteins 80 or 86. These proteins interact with their corresponding receptors on T cells, PD-1 and CTLA-4, respectively, to turn off the immune system response to the cancer. Multiple approved immunotherapies disrupt the connection between PD-1 or CTLA-4 and their ligands to restore immune activity against susceptible cancers.

19
--


Dr. Elias has demonstrated in widely accepted mouse models of fibrosis that PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are induced in melanoma metastases by Chi3l1, and that Chi3l1 can stimulate these checkpoint inhibitors, thereby encouraging tumor growth. Further work by Dr. Elias has demonstrated that bispecific antibodies that bind to both Chi3l1 and PD-1 (or CTLA-4) dramatically improve the responses seen in cocultures of T cells and tumor cells with more tumor cells undergoing cell death when treated with the bispecific antibody than cells treated with mono-specific antibodies against the same targets, either individually or in combination (Fig. 2). These studies also demonstrated that these effects were mediated by an enhanced induction of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that kill the tumor cells and an enhanced ability of these cytotoxic cells to bind to tumor cell membranes in cultures treated with the bispecific antibody compared to cultures treated with mono-specific antibodies against the same targets, administered either individually or in combination. These observations suggest that the proximity of the Chi3l1 and PD-1 (or CTLA-4) targets in the tumor microenvironment play a role in their vulnerability to this precision immunotherapy 9 (Fig. 3). Thus, we hypothesize that even patients whose tumors have been resistant to anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy may benefit from our bi-specific antibody product candidates that are designed to bind both Chi3l1 and immune checkpoint targets simultaneously. These bi-specific antibodies against Chi3l1 and PD-1 or CTLA-4 are the basis for our OCX-410 and OCX-909 programs, respectively.

Figure 3: Mechanism of Action of OCX-410
 
We are planning to initially target checkpoint inhibitor positive NSCLC with OCX-410 and GBM with OCX-909 due to the previously published importance of these checkpoint inhibitors for these tumor types as well as Dr. Elias’ supporting data in preclinical models of these diseases. We intend to evaluate whether checkpoint inhibitor upregulation is critical for the activity of OCX-410 and OCX-909 in humans, and we intend to evaluate the response seen in checkpoint inhibitor negative patients as well. The outcome of these studies may help us to better identify our potential target patient population.

Oncology Product Candidates Clinical Development Plan
 
All three therapeutic antibody product candidates, OCX-253, OCX-410, and OCX-909, have been optimized against their respective targets, and we are beginning efforts to develop, through the establishment of manufacturing and supply relationships with third parties, a production system capable of supporting clinical use. A critical step in production is the creation of a master cell bank, or MCB, a depository where genetically identical antibody-producing cells are stored, by a CMO. The MCB is critical for production of consistent therapeutics through clinical development and, potentially, commercial production. We have collaborated on the first steps of MCB production for OCX-253 with Lonza Group AG, a global contract manufacturing organization and have completed development of 8 research cell lines that produce OCX-253 in February 2021. Initial assessments indicate that any of these cell lines could possibly be used to generate clinical and commercial grade OCX-253. Additional evaluations are under way to determine which of the 8 cell lines is preferred for the generation of the cGMP MCB and the generation of clinical drug material. We anticipate producing sufficient drug material to begin IND-enabling safety studies in 2H 2023. The OCX-410 and OCX-909 programs are expected to begin MCB generation in 2H 2023/1H 2024. We anticipate filing IND applications with the FDA for product candidates in 2023/2024.
 
We intend to model our Phase 1/2 clinical trials of OCX-253 and OCX-410 after Merck’s pembrolizumab KEYNOTE-001 trial (NCT01295827). This design is expected to allow for combined initial safety and efficacy endpoints using a single ascending dose, or SAD, strategy followed by a repeat dose regimen to identify tumor responses through generally accepted Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, criteria and time to tumor progression. Using RECIST criteria as the primary endpoint of the initial clinical trial will measure whether tumors shrink in response to treatment and allows for a relatively quick determination of whether our product candidates are likely to provide benefit in a larger, more extensive pivotal trial. The time to the tumor progression endpoint will likely be a secondary endpoint in these first trials but is the generally accepted primary endpoint for registrational trials in NSCLC.
 
GBM
 
The OCX-909 program for GBM has the additional challenge of successfully delivering the protein therapeutic product candidate to the brain where the Blood Brain Barrier or BBB has questionable permeability. The BBB is a stretch of less-permeable blood vasculature in the CNS, as compared to the rest of the body. Its purpose is to carefully screen the entry and exit of molecules between the CNS and bloodstream. The BBB is a difficult hurdle to cross using small molecules delivered to the periphery, and consistent peripheral delivery of protein-based therapeutics, such as antibodies, to the brain has so far been elusive. Patients suffering from GBM may have a partially disrupted BBB due to changes in the vasculature associated with the tumors or their recent surgery, but the inconsistency of these disruptions may add considerable challenge to the development of a peripherally delivered medicament.
 
We plan to bypass the BBB using a number of approaches, alone or in combination. The first approach is intracerebral-ventricular, or ICV, delivery of OCX-909. We intend to make use of a port-reservoir system, such as an Ommaya reservoir, which is a small, plastic, coin-shaped device placed under the scalp and connected to a catheter placed in one of the brain’s ventricles. This would allow direct delivery of OCX-909 into the cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, pool in the ventricles at the center of the brain. The size of the ICV space changes throughout the day, particularly during sleep, effectively pumping CSF, and the drug it contains, throughout the brain. Though placement of an Ommaya reservoir is somewhat invasive, it is frequently used in patients suffering from brain cancers, and we anticipate many of our patients will likely already have one in place.
 
We intend to model our Phase 1/2 clinical trial after the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Johnson and Johnson’s Zarnestra sponsored by M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (NCT00050986). The envisioned clinical trial plan involves a dose escalation SAD/multiple ascending dose, or MAD, strategy followed by continued assessments of safety parameters and efficacy using six-month progression free survival as the primary endpoint. We anticipate also monitoring tumor size during this trial using radiology techniques in the interest of acquiring efficacy data more rapidly than the primary endpoint is likely to provide.



21
--


Our Phase 3 clinical trial for OCX-909 is tentatively planned to follow the example of Merck’s CENTRIC trial of Cilengitide (NCT00689221). The CENTRIC trial used overall survival as the approval endpoint leading to a study duration over five years. We intend to continue to work with the oncology community to develop novel validated biomarkers, which could allow for accelerated trials in GBM. We are optimistic that these novel tools may allow for accelerated trials in the GBM space which could speed the transition of OCX-909 to the market. We intend to seek orphan drug designation for OCX-909 in GBM and may also request priority review.
 
Fibrosis Product Candidate for IPF and HPS:
 

● | OCF-203 anti-Chit1 Small Molecule 
--+--------------------------------------

Overview of Fibrotic Diseases
 
An important protective mechanism for tissue regeneration and wound healing is the formation of extracellular matrix, or ECM, a non-cellular portion of a tissue produced and secreted by cells and functions mainly to provide support for tissues.
 
Fibrosis is a pathologic condition where an excessive accumulation of ECM leads to organ disfunction and failure. Fibrotic diseases constitute a major health problem worldwide and encompass a wide spectrum of clinical entities including systemic fibrotic diseases such as systemic sclerosis, or SSc, scleroderma and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, as well as numerous organ-specific disorders including pulmonary, cardiac, liver and kidney fibrosis.
 
The United States government estimates that 45% of deaths in the United States can be attributed to fibrotic disorders. Fibrosis is a factor in various tissue and organ diseases as shown in the figure below.




Figure 4
 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
 
IPF is a chronic, progressive, and fibrotic interstitial lung disease of unknown cause, which occurs primarily in older adults. It results in irreversible loss of lung function with high morbidity and mortality rates. Median survival is three-to-five years following diagnosis.

22
--


IPF is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence ranging from 10-to-60 per 100,000 in the United States and 1.3 to 32.5 per 100,000 in Europe depending on country, age, and risk factors. There is an estimated prevalence of approximately 160,000 in the United States, with most cases occurring in individuals over the age of 50 years. The United States incidence rate is approximately 55,000 cases per year, and the incidence is rising due to a growing elderly population and increased disease awareness and detection.
 
In practice, patients are diagnosed and categorized into three categories, as shown below, based on disease severity: mild, moderate, and severe. Their disease may be characterized based on two lung function measures: FVC, or forced vital capacity, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, or DLCO,
 

Figure 5
 
Current therapeutic standard-of-care utilizes Roche’s Esbriet (pirfenidone) or Boehringer’s Ofev (nintedanib). Pirfenidone and nintedanib slow pulmonary function loss with only modest deceleration of disease progression and no reversal, and their severe side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) cause many patients to avoid or discontinue these therapies. These drugs are primarily used in the moderate patient segment—both mild and severe patients view the negative side effect profile as outweighing the benefits. Despite the side effects, it is estimated that approximately 58% of patients diagnosed with IPF take one of these therapeutics and, together, they generated global sales of approximately $3.0 billion in 2019. We believe that a therapy with even a modest improvement in side effect profile would likely see more utilization.
 
Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome
 
HPS is a rare, inherited genetic disorder which occurs when a child inherits defective genes from both parents. Although HPS is ultra-rare from a worldwide perspective, it has a much higher prevalence in Puerto Rico – where the prevalence is roughly 1 in 1,800 in the northwest region of the island, or an estimated 1,500 patients, accounting for more than 50% of the worldwide HPS population. HPS effects approximately 1 to 9 people per 1 million individuals worldwide outside of Puerto Rico. The disease onset occurs as early as age 30, and the lifespan of patients with some of the most severe disease subtypes usually does not exceed 40 to 50 years. HPS is diagnosed through a combination of identifying signs of albinism, evaluation of patient blood, and/or genetic testing; however, early diagnosis of PF in HPS patients presents the same challenges as IPF diagnosis.
 
There is an unmet need for therapeutics to treat HPS-related pulmonary fibrosis, or HPS-PF, patients. There is no approved drug therapy, and no treatment except potential lung transplantation. The only pharmacological option for patients is off-label use of Esbriet, which may slow disease progression but only in patients who retain significant residual lung function. Published clinical studies of Esbriet and Ofev suggest that bleeding is more likely with Ofev, so its use is generally avoided in the HPS patient population.



23
--


We believe that OCF-203, if approved, has potential to address the need for a HPS therapeutic due to its novel therapeutic approach. It is also our belief that developing this product candidate for HPS may allow us to enter the broader fibrotic disease space in an expedited manner by pursuing an ultra-rare disease indication before potentially broadening to adjacent indications.
 
The Chitinase Biology Behind Our Fibrosis Product Candidate
 
Previously, we described Dr. Elias’ research on chitinase enzymes and CLP, and his discovery of the key role that a CLP called Chi3l1 plays in cancer. Dr. Elias also discovered that a chitinase called Chit1, also known as chitotriosidase, plays a central role in inflammation and in fibrotic diseases such as IPF and HPS. Chit1 is expressed in an exaggerated manner in IPF where it correlates inversely with Smad 7. Chit1 is also a critical biomarker and therapeutic target in Scleroderma-associated interstitial lung disease. This finding is the basis for our anti-Chit1 small molecule therapeutic product candidate, OCF-203.
 
OCF-203—Small Molecule Candidate for IPF and HPS
 
In animal models, Dr. Elias and his colleagues showed that Chit1 is a master regulator of transforming growth factor beta 1, an extensively-published biochemical pathway relevant to inflammation, tissue modeling, and fibrosis, and that it mediated fibrosis response through various mechanisms described below. Animal models of IPF exhibit similar pathology to that of humans, allowing for relevant testing of molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutics in these models. Transgenic laboratory animals developed in the Elias laboratory to over-express Chit1 were shown to be far more susceptible to lung fibrosis than their wild type counterparts, which further demonstrates the role of Chit1 as a factor in IPF.
 
Using high throughput screening, Dr. Elias identified a small molecule candidate for the OCF-203 program that prevented and reduced inflammation and fibrosis in the bleomycin mouse model of IPF (Fig. 5). Importantly, the molecular mediators of fibrosis, fibronectin, Col1A1, and Col3A1, were also substantially reduced in the IPF model animals that had received the OCF-203 candidate. Results were similar in a mouse model of HPS (Fig. 6), suggesting that the OCF-203 molecule could benefit this patient population as well. The biochemical pathways known to be impacted by Chit1 inhibition imply that there may be benefit of this product candidate for the potential treatment of other fibrotic diseases such as non-alcoholic-steatohepatitis, or NASH, and lysosomal storage disorders.

Figure 7: OCF-203 Lead Candidate Treatment of the Bleomycin HPS-1 Mouse Model results in Normalized Levels of Fibrotic Markers
 
No significant toxicity has been observed at therapeutic doses in the animal studies with the OCF-203 lead to date. This candidate molecule has been previously evaluated (by unrelated parties) in Japan in the mid-1960s for potential use as an antibiotic – though approval was never pursued. While the clinical data from these studies is not suitable for current regulatory filings, we believe it may support the safety observations seen in Dr. Elias’ recent animal studies and also provides invaluable information as to the behavior of this molecule and its derivatives that we can potentially use in the design of future clinical development work. Additionally, we believe OCF-203’s safety observations in animal studies may be further supported by past published literature which estimates that 6% of humans do not produce Chit1 and, though they may be more susceptible to infection by chitin-containing parasites, this deficiency may provide greater longevity and reduced age-related disease burden as compared to people who produce Chit1 normally. Taken together, these findings suggest that therapies that focus on inhibiting Chit1 may be well tolerated in patients. This is of import to IPF and HPS given that there are no currently approved drug therapies for HPS, and the currently approved therapies for IPF, pirfenidone and nintedanib, both carry a significant risk of severe side effects, as described previously.
Fibrosis Programs Clinical Development Plan
 
We have identified opportunities in the structure of OCF-203 that we believe may be able to improve the expected risk/benefit ratio for patients. We intend to embark on a limited structure-activity-relationship, or SAR, study and plan to begin IND enabling studies in 2023. We plan to submit our IND application to the FDA in the second half of 2023.
Clinical Development
 
Clinical development of OCF-203 is expected to initiate with a single Phase 1/2 clinical trial in IPF that we plan will be followed by later stage clinical development for IPF and HPS in parallel. We intend to conduct a Phase 1/2 SAD/MAD trial in patients with IPF that is modeled after the Phase 2 portion of the Galapagos PINTA trial (NCT03725852). Our Phase 1/2 clinical trial is expected to be designed to provide human proof of concept data demonstrating the cessation of fibrosis progression, which would allow for the initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials in both IPF and HPS. The Phase 3 clinical trial of OCF-203 for the prevention of fibrotic progression in IPF will likely be modeled after the Genentech ASCEND trial (NCT01366209), while the Phase 3 clinical trial of OCF-203 for the prevention of fibrotic progression in HPS will likely be modeled after the National Human Genome Research Institute, or NHGRI, trial in HPS patients (NCT00001596). Both the Genentech and NHGRI trials were evaluating pirfenidone. We intend to seek orphan drug designation for OCF-203 in HPS.

Infectious diseases, caused by infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites are the primary cause of more than 12.5% of all deaths worldwide. Efforts to reduce this death toll are hampered by drug resistant pathogens and, for many pathogens, a lack of effective vaccines. As detailed below, our infectious disease program is designed to address this significant unmet medical need and will initially focus on malaria, the greatest single agent killer of children worldwide. Please see the section entitled “Description of Business – Our Therapeutic Programs – Malaria Background: Epidemiology and Lifecycle” below.
 
ODA-570—malaria vaccine
 
Using the WPDS platform, Dr. Kurtis has identified PfGARP and PfSEA-1 as parasite antigens that are recognized by antibodies in the plasma of children who are relatively resistant—but not in those who are susceptible—to malaria caused by P. falciparum.
 
PfSEA-1 is a parasite antigen with a mass of 244 kilodaltons, which has no significant similarity to proteins of known function. PfSEA-1 displays minimal sequence variation in the region we cloned (amino acids 810 to 1083) across hundreds of parasite strains. Antibodies made in mice immunized with recombinant PfSEA-1 have been shown to inhibit parasite growth by 58% to 74% across three parasite strains compared with controls (Fig 8). Similarly, purified human antibodies to PfSEA-1 have also been shown to significantly inhibit parasite growth in laboratory studies. In both cases, anti-PfSEA-1 antibodies trapped parasites within the red cell, preventing their egress, and led to parasite death.
 

Figure 8. Antibodies to PfSEA-1 kill parasites. Polyclonal anti-PfSEA-1 antibodies in mice inhibit parasite growth by 74% in vitro. Ring stage 3D7 parasites were cultured in the presence of anti-PfSEA-1 mouse sera at 1:10 dilution. Negative controls included no anti-sera and pre-immune mouse sera. Red blood cells (RBC).
 
In vaccine challenge experiments in mouse models of malaria infection, immunization with a recombinant protein encoding the P. berghei ANKA (a lethal mouse malaria strain) ortholog of PfSEA-1, or PbSEA-1, or antibodies to PbSEA-1 conferred marked protection against a lethal P. berghei ANKA challenge as evidenced by up to a 75% reduction in parasitemia seven days after challenge. In all five experiments performed, by day seven to eight after challenge, control mice had high parasitemia with associated morbidity, whereas none of the vaccinated mice had high parasitemia or overt morbidity. In experiments with long-term follow-up, both active immunization with rPbSEA-1 and passive transfer of antibodies to PbSEA-1 significantly reduced parasitemia and delayed mortality.

In human observational studies conducted in Tanzania, individuals with naturally acquired antibodies to PfSEA-1 were associated with significant protection from severe malaria, with no cases occurring while children had detectable antibodies to PfSEA-1 (Fig 9). In a second longitudinal Kenyan cohort, anti–PfSEA-1 antibodies were associated with significant protection against parasitemia in adolescents and young adults. Individuals with detectable IgG anti–rPfSEA-1 antibodies had 50% lower parasite densities over 18 weeks of follow-up compared with individuals with no detectable IgG anti-rPfSEA-1A antibodies.
 

Figure 9. Antibodies to rPfSEA-1A predict reduced malaria severity and parasitemia. Incidence of severe malaria and death in Tanzanian children aged one and a half to three and a half years during intervals with detectable and undetectable antibodies to PfSEA-1 (1688 and 23,806 weeks, respectively). No cases of severe malaria or death occurred during intervals with detectable antibodies to rPfSEA-1A. Error bars represent 95% CI.
 
Based on these data, we hypothesize that vaccination of humans with PfSEA-1 could generate antibodies that trap parasites within a red cell and lead to parasite death.
 
PfGARP is a parasite antigen with a mass of 80 kilodaltons that is expressed on the external surface of erythrocytes (red blood cells) infected by early-to-late-trophozoite-stage parasites.

Antibodies against PfGARP kill trophozoite-infected erythrocytes in culture by inducing programmed cell death in the parasites (see Fig 10). Vaccinating non-human primates with PfGARP has been shown to protect against a challenge with P. falciparum (see Fig 11). Furthermore, longitudinal cohort studies have shown that, compared to individuals who had naturally occurring anti-PfGARP antibodies, Tanzanian children without anti-PfGARP antibodies had a 2.5-fold-higher risk of severe malaria, and Kenyan adolescents and adults without these antibodies had a 2-fold-higher parasite density.





Figure 11. Vaccination with PfGARP-A protects monkeys from challenge with P. falciparum. A) Animals were vaccinated with PfGARP-A mRNA-LNP (n=5 monkeys) poly(C) RNA-LNP (negative control, n=4 monkeys) and challenged IV with 104 P. falciparum FVO strain infected RBC. Parasitemia was followed daily. Points represent means, error bars represent SEM.) B) Animals were vaccinated with rPfGARP-A protein (n=5 monkeys) or control (n=4 monkeys) and challenged IV with 104 P. falciparum FVO strain infected RBC. Parasitemia was followed daily. Points represent means, error bars represent SEM. * indicates P < 0.05. ** indicates P < 0.01 in two-sided t-Tests.
 
We hypothesize that killing of trophozoite-infected erythrocytes by targeting PfGARP will kill P. falciparum malaria parasites before they cause disease. We also hypothesize that a vaccine targeting PfGARP could synergize with vaccine antigens, like PfSEA-1, that target parasite egress from erythrocytes.

Importantly, PfGARP and PfSEA-1 are novel targets with no homology, or similarity, to any human proteins and when these genes have been sequenced in thousands of parasite strains, they have minimal sequence variation in the region that is contained in our vaccine formulations. Based on these data, we believe that vaccination with PfGARP and/or PfSEA-1 is unlikely to generate immunologic toxicity in humans and further suggest that the parasite may likely not be able to mutate to escape the killing effect of the vaccine induced antibodies.
 
It is important to note that, unlike the target of the RTS,S vaccine (circumsporozoite protein), PfSEA-1 and PfGARP antigens are expressed in the host for 8 to 24 hours which allows sufficient time for them to be targeted by vaccine induced antibodies. This is in stark contrast to the circumsporozoite protein, which is only expressed during the sporozoite stage of the P. falciparum lifecycle and thus only available for intervention during the first five minutes of infection. Furthermore, P. falciparum disease progression is dependent upon repeated rounds of schizont formation, merozoite egress, and infection of new erythrocytes (see lifecycle description above), and each time the cycle repeats the parasite again becomes vulnerable to anti-PfSEA-1 or anti-PfGARP antibodies. In contrast, parasites that escape the small window of intervention induced by the RTS,S vaccine are not prevented from further growth and replication. The subsequent unimpeded progression through the parasite lifecycle is likely a primary contributor to the relatively low immunization success rate seen with RTS,S.
 
We are currently evaluating whether a vaccine targeting PfSEA-1, PfGARP or a combination of the two antigens would present the best opportunity to protect patients from P. falciparum infection.
 
ODA-611—Anti-PfGARP mAbs
 
We produced a series of mAbs in mice that were immunized with laboratory generated recombinant PfGARP. Of the 16 mAbs that reacted with PfGARP in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, only one mAb killed parasites in culture (see Fig 12). We sequenced and expressed the heavy-chain and light-chain variable regions (the genes that encode the mAb), and the resulting recombinant mAb had a dissociation constant, or Kd, of 2.9 nM, (indicating strong binding of the monoclonal to its target PfGARP) and killed parasites in culture. A monovalent antigen-binding fragment, or Fab, of this antibody also killed parasites in culture. These data confirmed that anti-PfGARP-mediated killing occurs in the absence of complement, cellular effector functions, or antigen cross-linking. We expect that a humanized version of this antibody will form the basis for our ODA-611 program.

ODA-579—small molecule targeting PfGARP
 
Our belief that PfGARP is a high value druggable target for anti-malarial drug development is based on PfGARP’s surface expression on infected RBCs, the absence of any significant amino acid homology with human host proteins, and the ability of antibody binding to PfGARP to kill parasites in vitro within 12-24 hours by activating parasite programed cell suicide.
 
To develop a drug based on PfGARP binding, Dr. Kurtis screened a small molecule library to identify compounds that inhibit the binding of anti-PfGARP antibody to PfGARP protein. Dr. Kurtis reasoned that compounds which bind to the same region of PfGARP that is targeted by the parasite-lethal anti-PfGARP antibodies would be enriched for effective anti-malarials. Dr. Kurtis screened 6,400 compounds using an assay that detects inhibition of binding of anti-PfGARP antibodies to immobilized PfGARP protein. Dr. Kurtis identified one compound as having anti-parasite activity.
 
Dr. Kurtis then conducted a limited Structure Activity Relationship, or SAR, campaign, evaluating 33 additional compounds with similarity to the structure of the first compound identified. Dr. Kurtis identified one compound with enhanced parasite killing activity compared to the original compound. This molecule has an IC50 (concentration of drug that results in half of the maximal killing effect) of between 1 and 4.8 uM in wild type parasites (3D7 strain) and no activity in a parasite strain that has had the PfGARP gene deleted (3D7 PfGARP KO) (see Fig 13). This result demonstrates both the specificity of drug activity for PfGARP, as well as the lack of general toxicity to eukaryotic cells. Toxicity assessments show no loss of viability in multiple mammalian cell lines at up to 400 uM, which was the highest concentration tested. These data are consistent with a selectivity index (ratio of IC50 for mammalian cells/IC50 for parasites) greater than 100.






Figure 13. Molecule kills P. falciparum parasites. 3D7 (top) or 3D7 PfGARP KO (bottom) parasites were synchronized to the ring stage and incubated with a dilution series of compounds or media control for 48 hours followed by quantification of parasitemia by pLDH assay. Each dilution was evaluated in quadruplicate and error bars represent SD. The IC50 = 4.8 uM for killing of 3D7 parasites. Results representative of two independent experiments.

Our Whole Proteome Differential Screening Platform for Antigen Discovery
 
Our infectious disease product candidates are the result of decades of NIH-funded work by our co-founder, Dr. Kurtis and his team. Dr. Kurtis developed the WPDS platform and used this platform to identify our two vaccine candidate antigens for malaria: Plasmodium falciparum Schizont Egress Antigen-1, or PfSEA-1, and Plasmodium falciparum Glutamic Acid Rich Protein, or PfGARP. The WPDS platform was first described by Dr. Kurtis in 2005, and later used to identify PfSEA-1 (published in Science, the peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and one of the world’s top academic journals) in 2014. Dr. Kurtis has since perfected the WPDS platform to discover PfGARP as described in his Nature (the world’s leading multidisciplinary science journal), 2020 publication.
 
The WPDS platform differs markedly from standard vaccine discovery approaches, which rely on the identification of immunodominant antigens (protein targets that generate large quantities of antibody) recognized by antibodies in animal models of human pathogens. Unfortunately, these animal models are often poor models of the complex human host-pathogen relationship and the immunodominant antigens are often decoys deployed by the pathogen to evade protective immune responses. Identifying the critical antigens that are the targets of protective antibodies on the pathogen is further complicated by the fact that susceptible humans make essentially the same antibody repertoire (i.e., recognize the same pathogen antigens) as resistant humans, thus masking the identity of the key, protective targets.
 
Dr. Kurtis designed the WPDS platform to specifically identify pathogen antigens that are only recognized by antibodies expressed by resistant, but not by susceptible, humans. The successful implementation of the WPDS platform requires blood samples from well characterized longitudinal cohort studies of individuals exposed to the pathogen, high quality gene libraries from the pathogen, and one-to-three months of experimental effort.
 
The WPDS platform identifies the pathogen antigens that are recognized by antibodies made by resistant individuals and then, importantly, removes, or excludes as vaccine targets, any antigens that are also recognized by susceptible individuals. This removal phase is essential as any antigen that is recognized by antibodies made by susceptible individuals cannot possibly be involved in providing protection.
 
We believe that the WPDS platform may be applicable to any human pathogen for which a subset of humans develops antibody-mediated resistance to infection/reinfection while a subset of humans remains susceptible. We believe that the platform may also enable us to identify targets against other infectious diseases.
 
The WPDS platform led to the discovery of novel targets against malaria, which are the basis for our anti-PfGARP therapeutics programs (ODA-611 and ODA-579) and for our vaccine program targeting PfGARP and PfSEA-1 (ODA-570).
 
Malaria Background: Epidemiology and Lifecycle
 
Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, infecting 200-300 million individuals and killing nearly 500,000 children in sub-Saharan Africa each year. Nearly half of the world’s population, consisting of more than three billion individuals, is at risk of malaria infection. Recent estimates indicate that even these staggering figures significantly underestimate the actual disease burden. In addition, people from the United States and Europe (including military personnel) who travel to malaria endemic regions are also at risk of contracting malaria.

Human malaria is caused by infection with one of five species of protozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium. Infection with just one of these species, P. falciparum, accounts for more than 95% of all malaria-related deaths. Plasmodium parasites have a complex lifecycle (Fig. 14), which begins when humans become infected following the bite of an infected anopheline mosquito. During blood feeding, an infected female mosquito (only female mosquitos feed on blood, which is necessary for egg laying) injects a parasite stage called a sporozoite into the human blood stream. These sporozoites leave the blood stream and rapidly (within 5 minutes) infect liver cells. Within the liver cells, the sporozoites multiply asexually with each sporozoite giving rise to up to 10,000 merozoites. These merozoites rupture out of the liver cell and each merozoite rapidly infects (within 140 microseconds) an individual red blood cell. Within the red blood cell, the merozoite undergoes an approximately 48-hour developmental cycle. Each merozoite sequentially develops into a ring stage parasite, a trophozoite stage parasite, a schizont stage parasite and then the schizont stage parasite segments into approximately 20 daughter merozoites, which rupture from the red blood cell. Each of these twenty daughter merozoites infect new red blood cells. This blood stage infection expands exponentially until the red blood cell loss become sufficient to cause disease. In addition, the trophozoite- and schizont-stage infected red blood cells become very sticky, leading to clogged blood vessels and tissue damage to the infected human. Ultimately, some of the parasites differentiate into sexual stages, which are referred to as gametocytes, which can be taken up by a mosquito during a blood meal. Within the mosquito, these gametocytes develop into sporozoites, which can be injected into a new host when the mosquito takes her next bloodmeal.

Limitations of Current Malaria Control Efforts
 
There are currently three approaches to control malaria, including insecticides to kill mosquitoes, bed nets to limit human-mosquito contact, and anti-malarial drugs used to treat infected individuals. While these interventions have some impact, each has significant limitations. Insecticides are expensive, difficult to apply, and harmful to the environment. More concerning is the emergence of widespread resistance of mosquitos to the insecticides which has led to the search for ever more lethal, and ecologically damaging, insecticides. Nevertheless, application of insecticides remains an important component of many national malaria control programs.
 
Bed nets have seen widespread distribution over the past 15 years based on data demonstrating that sleeping under an insecticide-impregnated bed net results in a low, but still significant, 16% reduction in child mortality. Bed nets suffer from issues of cost, maintenance (they must be repaired and re-dipped in insecticide), and compliance.

Given the low efficacy of bed nets and insecticides, the cornerstone of malaria control programs remains the treatment of symptomatic cases with anti-malarial drugs. Unfortunately, malaria parasites are particularly good at developing resistance to anti-malarial drugs and have done so for every anti-malarial drug ever developed. Currently, the most effective antimalarial drug is artemisinin and its derivatives. The recent development of artemisinin resistance in south east Asia, coupled with its detection in sub-Saharan Africa, threatens to reverse the reductions in malaria-attributed mortality seen in the past decade. Given the socio-ecological context of malaria, delayed access to drug treatment, with its consequent increased mortality, remains a major challenge to control programs.
 
The world continues to experience a high burden of malaria and we believe this calls for the development of new drugs and vaccines.
 
Current Landscape of Malaria Vaccines
 
A broadly effective malaria vaccine represents the holy-grail of malaria control efforts and has been pursued by scientists for decades without success. The most advanced malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S, has publicly reported relatively low efficacy (17% and 32% protection from severe malaria in infants and young children, respectively). More concerning, RTS,S reports two significant safety signals: a ten-fold increased risk of bacterial meningitis and two-fold increased risk of mortality in girls. These safety signals had resulted in a decision in 2016 by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, under recommendation by the World Health Organization, or WHO, to limit release of the RTS,S vaccine to a pilot introduction in three African countries (Kenya, Malawi, and Ghana) with detailed follow-up of safety outcomes that would then be used to decide whether to proceed with broad release. In October 2021 the WHO recommended broader roll-out of the RTS,S / Mosquirix vaccine after concluding it was safe based on studies from its pilot introduction, though of note these studies were not clinical trials and did not include a control group.
 
The RTS,S vaccine seeks to generate antibodies that prevent the sporozoite from entering the liver cell, a process that takes less than five minutes. The high antibody levels necessary to block this rapid event are very difficult to achieve and even harder to maintain. Parasites which escape the RTS,S antibodies and invade a liver cell will give rise to a full-blown malaria infection as the vaccine has no impact on the red blood cell stages of the malaria life cycle. These fundamental properties of the RTS,S vaccine result in the vaccine’s poor efficacy and create a significant unmet medical need that our vaccine will endeavor to address.
 
Indications and Addressable Market for Malaria Programs
 
The target indication for our malaria vaccine ODA-570, is malaria in all at risk populations. This includes individuals living in malaria-endemic areas, as well as travelers to these areas. Based on the epidemiology, the addressable market for a malaria vaccine is more than three billion individuals.
 
Based on the immunology of malaria, we expect that the initial course of vaccination would entail three doses over a three-month period, with subsequent booster doses required every one-to-two years. In the developing world, we expect that our vaccine, if approved for marketing, will likely be included in the WHO-expanded program in immunization, or EPI, which currently achieves greater than 85% coverage for eligible children worldwide.
 
We believe that our malaria antibody, ODA-611, may have both therapeutic and prophylactic applications. The target indication for ODA-611 is the prevention of malaria in short-term travelers to malaria endemic areas, including tourists, government employees and military personnel.
 
We expect the target indication for our malaria drug, ODA-579, if approved, to be the treatment of mild to moderately severe malaria infection. There are 200-300 million malaria infections per year. We estimate the addressable market for our anti-malarial drug to be more than 200 million persons per year.
 
In addition to this prophylactic indication, we believe that our anti-PfGARP antibody could have therapeutic use in individuals with severe malaria, who are typically unable to take oral medicines. While data on the incidence of severe malaria is difficult to obtain, more than 500,000 people die each year due to malaria, each of which, by definition, represented a severe malaria case. Thus we believe this represents a reasonable estimate of the addressable worldwide market for our anti-PfGARP antibody as a therapeutic for severe malaria.

Infectious Disease Programs Clinical Development Plan
 
The ODA-570 Plasmodium falciparum vaccine is completing optimization efforts and, when completed, we plan to begin IND-enabling studies with an expected IND filing date in the second half of 2023. Clinical development will likely be modeled after the GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, trials of their RTS, S vaccine (Mosquirix). We plan to conduct the Phase 1 clinical trial in two stages in a population of healthy volunteer adults, with the Phase 1a goal being to establish the safety of ODA-570 and Phase 1b goals to demonstrate the generation of antibodies following a ODA-570 administration and to find a preferred dosing regimen for the vaccine. The Phase 1a/b design is intended to allow for cost-effective and rapid assessment of ODA-570 on a preliminary basis. We anticipate that our Phase 2 clinical trial would proceed with the GSK RTS, S model (NCT00197041), comparing the efficacy of ODA-570 to standard of care. We expect that our Phase 3 clinical trial of ODA-570 will likely have a similar design to the Phase 2 clinical trial, although in a greater geographic area and with a participation of more volunteers, such as was done by GSK in the development of their RTS, S vaccine (NCT00866619). We expect the ODA-570 program to qualify for priority NDA review based on the neglected tropical diseases qualification and, if approved, may be eligible for a tropical disease priority review voucher.
 
The ODA-611 and ODA-579 Plasmodium falciparum therapeutic product candidates are also in the optimization stage, with ODA-611 anticipated to begin IND-enabling studies (including antibody humanization) in 2022. The chemical structure of ODA-579 allows for the possibility of further refinement, so we plan for limited SAR work to be conducted prior to the initiation of IND-enabling studies. However, we believe that the relatively short manufacturing development period for small molecules, such as ODA-579, should allow for the filing of IND applications for both ODA-579 and ODA-611 in the first half of 2024. It is our intention that the ODA-611 and ODA-579 Plasmodium falciparum therapeutic product candidates will initially follow the clinical development example of Takeda and AbbVie’s DSM265 (ACTRN12613000522718 and ACTRN12613000527763). The Phase 1a portion of the trial of ODA-611 will likely be a single-ascending dose, or SAD, trial based on the expected long half-life of this antibody, that is aimed at evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics. The Phase 1a portion of ODA-579 will likely begin with a SAD study, and an additional MAD may be added depending on the pharmacokinetics observed. Both drugs are expected to proceed into a Phase 1b trial that will likely consist of a small number of volunteers testing the efficacy of the product candidates following a challenge with P. falciparum. This design is intended to allow us to observe any early signs of efficacy on a preliminary basis that could help guide future development and further refine the dosing strategy. The Phase 2 clinical trials of ODA-611 and ODA-579 are modeled after that of Novartis’ KAE607 (NCT03334747). This trial design allows for assessment of the impact of different dose levels and treatment regimens of the molecules in the treatment of P. falciparum infected patients in a region where malaria is endemic. The registration trials of ODA-611 and ODA-579 are aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of these treatments in combination with standard of care and are modeled after the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’, or NIAID, past work exploring combinations with chloroquine (NCT00379821). While the NIAID’s chloroquine trial was primarily focused on children, we anticipate recruiting both adults and children because we believe this may maximize the treatable population should our therapeutic candidate receive regulatory approval.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We seek to protect the intellectual property (“IP”) and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and methods of using the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to the development of our business. We likewise seek to protect the IP to which we obtain rights through direct and indirect licenses (e.g., from universities and research institutions) and work collaboratively with our licensors to ensure (and if possible be the driver of) patent prosecution and protection. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and IP positions. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position(s) for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending provisional and patent cooperation treaty, or PCT, patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued patents we may obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in any patents we may own or in-license in the future.



34
--


Any issued patents that we may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier expiring patent.
 
The term of a patent claiming a new drug product may also be eligible for a limited patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. In the future, if our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on any issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for each product and other factors.
 
There can be no assurance that our pending provisional or PCT patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any patents we may own or in-license in the future. In addition, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.

The issued patents and pending patent applications have nominal expiration dates ranging from 2032 to 2041, without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions.

Under the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products in accordance with the development and commercialization plan, to introduce Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Products into the commercial market and to market Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Products after such introduction in the market, and we must meet certain development and commercialization milestones or else failure to do so will be considered a material breach of the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement.
 
In consideration for the rights conveyed by Elkurt under the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement, we must pay to Elkurt a non-refundable, annual license fee. For the first year of the term, we are obligated to pay Elkurt an initial license fee of $70,000, payable in two installments of $35,000 each on April 1, 2023 and June 30, 2023. Beginning September 13, 2023 we are obligated to pay Elkurt an annual license maintenance fee equal to (a) $3,000 until September 13, 2027, and (b) thereafter, an annual license maintenance fee of $4,000. We are also obligated to pay to Elkurt low, single-digit royalties, on net sales of any Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Products that are commercialized by us or our sublicensees. If we grant any sublicenses under the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Licenses, we are obligated to pay to Elkurt an initial sublicense fee that is either 10% or 25% depending, respectively, on whether we execute the sublicense after or before the first commercial sale of a Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Product. We are also required to pay certain milestone payments on a Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Product-by-Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Product basis upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones, totaling up to $700,000 for each Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Product. To the extent net sales or non-royalty sublicense income are generated from any Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Products that are commercialized by us or our sublicensees that incorporate or otherwise utilizes the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Know-How but not covered by any Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Patents, we may reduce the applicable royalty rates and non-royalty income rates by half. These payment amounts are identical to the amounts owed by Elkurt to Brown University under the Upstream Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License, except that Elkurt is not obligated to pay Brown University any annual maintenance fees. We also are required to pay Elkurt $100,000 in the event that we or one of sublicensees sublicenses this technology to a major pharmaceutical company or if the license agreement or any sublicense agreement for this technology is acquired by a major pharmaceutical company. A major pharmaceutical company is one that is publicly traded, with market capitalization of at least $5 billion and has been engaged in drug discovery, development, production and marketing for no less than 5 years.

The Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement requires us to achieve future development milestones by certain dates. Recognizing the unpredictability of clinical development, the agreement allows us to request amendments and/or extensions to these milestones by providing Elkurt with a reasonable explanation for such requests along with plans for achieving the extended and/or amended milestones. Although Elkurt is obliged to reasonably extend or amend those milestones, it may terminate the agreement for failure to achieve development milestones after giving us reasonable opportunity to cure. The Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement sets forth the following future development milestones for the malaria small molecules program: the filing of an IND in 2027; the commencement of Phase 1/2 clinical trials in 2027; and the commencement of a Phase 3 clinical trial in 2029. Elkurt may also terminate the agreement if we do not complete a $10 million equity financing by November 1, 2023.
 
Unless earlier terminated, the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement, including the royalty bearing license will expire upon the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Patent covering any Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Products in any country or (b) ten years. We may terminate the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement in its entirety at any time for convenience. Either party may terminate the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement in its entirety upon the other party’s uncured material breach after an opportunity to cure such material breach. Elkurt may terminate the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement in its entirety immediately upon notice for failure by us to meet certain milestones or the failure to achieve a certain amount of financing. Elkurt may also terminate the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement for our insolvency. If the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules License Agreement is terminated by either party for any reason, the Brown Anti-PfGARP Small Molecules Licenses will terminate and all the rights thereunder will revert to Elkurt.
 
Competition in our Industry
 
Competition for New Product Candidates
 
Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience, scientific resources and business model provide us with competitive advantages and may make us a partner of choice to research universities and medical centers, we face substantial competition from pharmaceutical companies as well as established and venture-backed biotechnology companies worldwide. For example, other companies such as BridgeBio similarly target research universities and medical centers to identify and develop therapeutic candidates that may or may not overlap with the inventions or technologies that we may seek to develop. As a result, we may face competition from other companies that are seeking to gain access to the types of institutions that we may seek to partner with. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
Competition for Existing Product Candidates
 
We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.
 
If our current product candidates or our future product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may otherwise not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.



43
--


Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 
In addition, we may likely need to develop certain of our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable treatments. Some of these competitive drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 
Oncology
 
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them.
 
In oncology, two of our programs, OCX-253 and OCX-410, are targeting NSCLC as their initial indication. For NSCLC, currently marketed oncology drugs and therapeutics range from traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, to immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PDL-1, such as Bristol Myers Squibb’s, or BMS’, Opdivo, Merck’s Keytruda, Genentech’s Tecentriq, Regeneron’s Libtayo, Astra Zeneca’s Imfinzi, and targeting CTLA- 4, such as BMS’ Yervoy. There are also numerous compounds in clinical development for the potential treatment of NSCLC including Roche’s tiragolumab which targets TIGIT. Our OCX-909 is targeting GBM, for which there are no currently approved therapies that are effective in treating this disease.
 
Fibrosis
 
Our program OCF-203 in fibrotic diseases is targeting IPF and HPS. For the treatment of IPF, we are aware of two approved products: Esbriet (pirfenidone), marketed by Roche Holding AG, and Ofev, marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH. Novartis launched a generic version of pirfenidone in May 2022. Roche and Boehringer Ingelheim are both developing next-generation IPF therapies. Companies currently developing product candidates in IPF in late-stage Phase III trials include Fibrogen, United Therapeutics, and Roche. Companies with IPF candidates in early-stage trials include BMS, Horizon, Pliant, Galecto Biotech, and Endeavor Biomedicines. For HPS, there are no marketed therapeutics and only one investigational program from Roche, which is targeting HPS patients who have an associated interstitial lung disease.

Infectious Disease
 
The infectious disease programs address both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of malaria. Our malaria vaccine program, ODA-570, currently has only one marketed competitor, GSK’s Mosquirix. Companies with the next most advanced vaccines are Sanaria with PfSPZ (beginning Phase 3 clinical trials) and VLP therapeutics (Phase 2 clinical trials). Additionally, there are several additional early-stage vaccine candidates in development. One application of our malaria antibody program, ODA-611, targets short-term prophylaxis. Several generic short-term prophylactic treatments are currently available, such as Atovaquone/Proguanil, chloroquine, doxycycline, mefloquine, primaquine, tafenoquine. Additionally, prophylactic anti-malarial therapies in pre-clinical or early stage development are being explored by Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), Merck, Lyndra Therapeutics, and Titan Pharmaceuticals. The NIH is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial, mAb CIS43LS, which is the only direct analogous competitor to our program.
 
Programs ODA-611 and ODA-579 have target indications for the treatment of symptomatic malaria infection. Currently favored treatment classes include quinoline-related compounds, antifolates, artemisinin derivatives, and antimicrobials. There are a variety of treatment options within these classes available and currently marketed by MMV, Novartis, Leadiant Biosciences, GSK, Millennial Hope, Roche, Takeda, and most recently IV Artesunate from Amivas. Additionally, MMV, Merck, J&J, and Eisai have severe malaria therapeutic candidates in early stage clinical trials.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel at this time. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on CMOs for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical testing, as well as for clinical testing and commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
 
Our product candidates include small molecules, vaccines, and monoclonal and bispecific antibodies. Several contract manufacturing facilities exist that have expertise in each product type and we anticipate that our product candidates can be produced by them at scale and in a cost-effective manner. As needed, we also expect to rely on CMOs for the manufacturing of companion diagnostics, which are assays or tests to identify an appropriate patient population. Depending on the technology solutions we choose, we may rely on multiple third parties to manufacture and sell a single test.
 
Commercialization
 
We will objectively assess and choose each program’s commercialization option that maximizes potential value for patients and for our shareholders. We anticipate optimizing its commercial value through various options, including internal advancement, partnerships with established companies, and spin-outs or IPOs. If we opt to commercialize a particular candidate ourselves, we anticipate assembling a focused sales and marketing organization to sell our products. We will aim for such organization to address the community of relevant medical practitioners who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. We may also enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
 
We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, manufacture, testing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, as well as diagnostics. Generally, before a new drug, biologic or diagnostic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved, authorized, or cleared by the applicable regulatory authority.

United States Government Regulation of Drug and Biological Products
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FD&C Act and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations, such as those related to competition. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative actions or judicial sanctions. These actions and sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal fines or penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, the market acceptance of our products and our reputation.
 
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either an NDA or a BLA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each human trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 
● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval or pre-license inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; 
● | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States. 

 
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the regulatory scheme for drugs and biologics is evolving and subject to change at any time. We cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.



46

Preclinical Studies
 
Before testing any drug or biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, stability and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
 
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin in the United States. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Additionally, the review of information in an IND application may prompt FDA to, among other things, scrutinize existing INDs or marketed products and could generate requests for information or clinical holds on other product candidates or programs.
 
Clinical Trials
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
 

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to evaluate proof of concept and/or determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling. 


47
--


Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators 15 days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 
Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 
FDA Review Process
 
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 

48
--


The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs to ensure they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within the required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require the applicant to obtain additional clinical data, including the potential requirement to conduct additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or to complete other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designation we have received, we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.

Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 
The FDA has authority to award priority review vouchers, or PRVs, to sponsors of certain tropical disease product applications. The FDA’s Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for the prevention and treatment of certain tropical diseases affecting millions of people throughout the world. Under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for the prevention or treatment a tropical disease that meets certain criteria may qualify for a PRV that can be redeemed to receive priority review of a subsequent NDA or BLA for a different product. The sponsor of a topical disease drug product receiving a PRV may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor of an NDA or BLA. The FD&C Act does not limit the number of times a PRV may be transferred before the voucher is used.
 
For a product to qualify for a PRV, (i) the sponsor must request approval of the product for the prevention or treatment of a “tropical disease” listed in Section 524 of the FD&C Act, (ii) the product must otherwise qualify for priority review, and (iii) the product must contain no active ingredient (including any salt or ester of an active ingredient) that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA or BLA. Applications also must contain reports of one or more new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) that were essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the sponsor. In addition, the sponsor must provide in the application an attestation that such report(s) were not submitted as part of an application for marketing approval or licensure by a regulatory authority in India, Brazil, Thailand, or any country that is a member of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention or the Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme prior to September 27, 2007.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
A sponsor may seek to develop and obtain approval of its product candidates under programs designed to accelerate the development, FDA review and approval of new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. For example, the FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that are intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a fast track-designated product, the FDA may consider sections of the NDA or BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting.
 
A product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development or review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Priority review means that, for a new molecular entity or original BLA, the FDA sets a target date for FDA action on the marketing application at six months after accepting the application for filing as opposed to ten months. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application for a new molecular entity or original BLA is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the disease or condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA requires that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
 
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval.
 
Pediatric Information and Pediatric Exclusivity
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FD&C Act to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

A drug or biologic product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted if a sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly responds to a “Written Request” from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”). Although physicians may in their independent medical judgment prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication.
 
Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval of the product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the drug or biologic reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug or biologic distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug or biologic, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug or biologic, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the drug from the market or product recalls; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | fines, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;

● | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of drug or biologic approvals; 
● | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | drug or biologic seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
We believe that the success of certain of our product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of a companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device or predicate devices and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device or predicate devices with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device or predicate devices, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer.
 
A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

In August 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the premarket application for the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug or biologic cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the product without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic. In November 2020, the FDA issued a final guidance, which addresses the development and labeling of in vitro companion diagnostic devices for a specific group of oncology therapeutic products.
 
Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of FDA’s quality system regulation, adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug and biologic makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with its authorities.
 
United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
 
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FD&C Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FD&C Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 
Certain of our product candidates will be regulated as biologics. An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, as part of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 
A reference biological product is granted four and twelve year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 
Other Regulatory Matters
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Office of Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights, as well as other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.

Other Healthcare Laws in the United States 

Healthcare providers, and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers and physicians and any future arrangements with third party payers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPPA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Our operations, including the future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
 
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
The Civil Monetary Penalties Statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity and their covered subcontractors. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians, and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians, certain other healthcare professionals, and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers will also be required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
 
Similar federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services. Such laws are generally broad and are enforced by various state agencies and private actions. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, and require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.
 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration or licensure of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, individual imprisonment, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.

Current and Future Legislation
 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 
For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA:
 

● | made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions”(i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 70% point-of-sale discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D. 
● | extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations. 
● | expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program. 
● | established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected. 


● | imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 
● | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 

 
While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. For example, the Tax Act includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” On December 14, 2018, a United States District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The case was argued in the United States Supreme Court on November 10, 2020. On February 10, 2021, the Biden administration informed the Supreme Court that the government had withdrawn its support of a nationwide repeal of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court held that states did not have standing to challenge the ACA and that the individual plaintiffs could not show sufficient injury to have standing, therefore avoiding having to make a substantive determination on the constitutionality of the law. While the litigation was pending, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how future litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach the required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, followed by a period of 1% payment adjustment April 1 - June 30, 2022, followed by a 2% payment adjustment beginning July 1, 2022. Further, in January 2013, former President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices.
 
Specifically, there have been several recent United States Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. On September 24, 2020, HHS and FDA issued a final rule under Section 804 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allowing commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada without the manufacturer’s authorization. The validity of the final rule has been challenged in federal court by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Partnership for Safe Medicines and the Council for Affordable Health Coverage. Further, on November 30, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to January 2026. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a new payment model, the Most Favored Nation Model, which would have tied Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. CMS withdrew the rule on December 27, 2021.
 
Packaging and Distribution in the United States
 
If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Further, products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the United States Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 

59
--


The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional federal and state requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant penalties, including criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing and distribution arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 
Other United States Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
 
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
 
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
 
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
 
European Drug Development
 
In the European Union, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the European Union, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.

The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the “Regulation”), which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The European Commission confirmed January 31, 2022 as the date of entry into application of the Regulation and the go-live of the Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”) by publishing a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union on July 31, 2021. The new Regulation will be directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU, for instance by providing for a streamlined application procedure via a single point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
 
European Drug Marketing
 
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
 
Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 
European Drug Review and Approval
 
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. There are two main types of marketing authorizations.

● | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States, or CMSs) for their approval. If the CMSs raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the CMSs). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required.
 
European Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 
In the EEA, innovative medicinal products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.

European Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 
In the EEA, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which either affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, or where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment must have been authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product in question would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition).
 
In the EEA, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, marketing authorization may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.


European Pediatric Investigation Plan
 
In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval). In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 
In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK, which ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the UK covering the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of medicinal products is derived from EU Directives and Regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the UK, as UK legislation now has the potential to diverge from EU legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term. The MHRA, the UK medicines and medical devices regulator, has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the UK’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.

European Data Collection
 
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, is governed by the GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the European Union. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
The Rest of the World Regulation
 
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Additional Laws and Regulations Governing International Operations
 
If we further expand our operations outside of the United States, we must dedicate additional resources to comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 
Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.
 
Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-United States nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If we expand our presence outside of the United States, it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.
 
The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on United States exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Successful commercialization of new drug products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for those drug products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drug products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford a drug product. Sales of drug products depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of drugs products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors.
 
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular drug products. In many countries, the prices of drug products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In general, the prices of drug products under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for drug products may be reduced compared with the United States.
 
In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new drug products are typically made by CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new drug product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to United States government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the average manufacturer price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children’s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 
These laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 
Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
 
Employees and Human Capital
 
As of March 28, 2023, we had nine full-time employees, including three with Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and two who are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants.
Facilities
 
Our research and development efforts have taken place in state-of-the-art facilities at our academic partners, principally at Brown University, which are being used under the Sponsored Research Agreements. Consistent with our lean and agile operating philosophy, we anticipate relying on these facilities going forward through sponsored research arrangements with Brown and with other university partners. In addition, we expect to access laboratory facilities and resources through various CRO partners such as Lonza with whom we are currently engaged.
 
We believe that our access to preclinical and clinical research facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable facilities at commercially reasonable terms will be available as needed to accommodate any future expansion of our operations.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we were not a party to any material legal matters or claims. In the future, we may become party to legal matters and claims in the ordinary course of business, the resolution of which we do not anticipate would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Status as a Public Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO (i.e., December 31, 2026), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
