Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Helmerich & Payne, Inc. ("H&P," which, together with its subsidiaries, is identified as the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,” except where stated or the context requires otherwise) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 3, 1940 and is successor to a business originally organized in 1920. We provide performance-driven drilling services and technologies that are intended to make hydrocarbon recovery safer and more economical for oil and gas exploration and production companies. We are an important vendor for a number of oil and gas exploration and production companies, but we focus primarily on the drilling segment of the oil and gas production value chain.
Our global business is composed of four reportable business segments - three contract drilling business segments: U.S. Land, Offshore and International Land and one drilling technology-based business segment: Helmerich & Payne Technologies ("H&P Technologies"). During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, our U.S. Land operations were located in Colorado, Louisiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming. Our Offshore operations were conducted in U.S. federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. Our International Land operations had rigs located in four international locations during fiscal year 2019: Argentina, Bahrain, Colombia and United Arab Emirates (“U.A.E.”). Our H&P Technologies operations focus on developing, promoting and commercializing technologies designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of drilling operations, as well as wellbore quality and placement. Our research and development endeavors include both internal development and external acquisition of developing technologies. 
We also own, develop and operate limited commercial real estate properties. Our real estate investments, which are located exclusively within Tulsa, Oklahoma, include a shopping center containing approximately 389,000 leasable square feet, multi‑tenant industrial warehouse properties containing approximately one million leasable square feet and approximately 210 acres of undeveloped real estate.

Our Segments
U.S. Land Segment
We believe we operate the largest technologically advanced AC drive drilling rig fleet in the United States and have a presence in most of the U.S. shale and unconventional basins. We have a leading market share in the three most active basins, which include the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, and Woodford Shale. More than 95 percent of our active rigs are drilling horizontal or directional wells. As of September 30, 2019, we had over 20 percent of the total market share in U.S. land drilling and approximately 37 percent of the super-spec market share in U.S. land drilling.
As of September 30, 2019, 194 of our 299 marketed rigs were under contract, 128 were under fixed‑term contracts, and 66 were working well-to-well. Over the past three fiscal years, we have reinvested in our fleet, upgrading 171 rigs to industry-leading super-spec capabilities that are designed to drill the most complex unconventional wells.
Our U.S. Land segment contributed approximately 85 percent ($2.4 billion) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal year 2019, compared with approximately 83 percent ($2.1 billion) and 80 percent ($1.4 billion) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. In the United States, we draw our customers primarily from the major oil companies, large independent oil companies and small cap oil companies. Additionally, we have a growing customer base in private equity-backed companies. 
Offshore Segment
Our Offshore Drilling segment has been in operation since 1968 and currently consists of eight rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. We supply the rig equipment and crews and the operator who owns the platform will typically provide production equipment or other necessary facilities. Our offshore rig fleet operates on both conventional jackup style platforms and floating platforms attached to the sea floor with mooring lines, such as Spars and Tension Leg Platforms. Additionally, we provide management contract services to customer platforms where the customer owns the drilling rig.
As of September 30, 2019, six of the eight offshore rigs were under contract. Our Offshore operations contributed approximately 5 percent ($147.6 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal year 2019, compared to approximately 6 percent ($142.5 million) and 8 percent ($136.3 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues from drilling services performed for our largest offshore drilling customer totaled approximately 65 percent ($96.0 million) of offshore revenues during fiscal year 2019.
International Land Segment
Our International Land segment operates primarily in Argentina and Colombia, in addition to smaller operations in Bahrain and U.A.E. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we ceased operations in Ecuador. As of September 30, 2019, we had 18 land rigs contracted for work in locations outside of the United States. Our International Land operations contributed approximately 8 percent ($211.7 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal year 2019, compared with approximately 10 percent ($238.4 million) and 12 percent ($213.0 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Argentina As of September 30, 2019, we had 20 rigs in Argentina. Revenues generated by Argentine drilling operations contributed approximately 6 percent ($165.7 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal year 2019 compared to approximately 8 percent ($190.0 million) and 9 percent ($157.3 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues from drilling services performed for our two largest customers in Argentina totaled approximately 6 percent of our consolidated operating revenues and approximately 74 percent of our international operating revenues during fiscal year 2019. The Argentine drilling contracts are primarily with large international or national oil companies. As of September 30, 2019, we believe we had over 15 percent of total market share and over 30 percent of the unconventional horizontal drilling market share in Argentina.
Colombia As of September 30, 2019, we had seven rigs in Colombia. Revenues generated by Colombian drilling operations contributed approximately 1 percent ($29.8 million) of our consolidated operating revenues in fiscal year 2019, compared to approximately 2 percent ($38.8 million) and 2 percent ($37.6 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues from drilling services performed for our two largest customers in Colombia totaled approximately 1 percent of our consolidated operating revenues and approximately 13 percent of our international operating revenues during fiscal year 2019. The Colombian drilling contracts are primarily with large international or national oil companies.
Bahrain As of September 30, 2019, we had two rigs in Bahrain.  Revenues generated by Bahrain drilling operations contributed approximately 0.4 percent ($11.5 million) of our consolidated operating revenues in fiscal year 2019, compared to approximately 0.4 percent ($9.5 million) and 0.6 percent ($10.0 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively.  All of our revenues in Bahrain are from a partner of the local national oil company.
United Arab Emirates As of September 30, 2019, we had two rigs in the U.A.E.  Revenues generated by U.A.E. drilling operations contributed approximately 0.2 percent ($4.7 million) of our consolidated operating revenues in fiscal year 2019, compared to nominal amounts in fiscal year 2018 and 0.5 percent ($8.2 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal year 2017. 
H&P Technologies

Effective October 1, 2018 and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we implemented organizational changes, consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources. As a result of the reorganization of our operations during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, we identified a new reportable segment, H&P Technologies. This reportable segment is used to drive development of advanced digital drilling technologies and directional drilling automation solutions, designed to improve safety, reliability, drilling consistency, and well performance economics for our customers. Subsequent to the reorganizations, all of our technology companies are included within the H&P Technologies reportable segment. Combining drilling technology expertise within this new segment creates a holistic solution-based approach that includes products, services and capabilities. This approach provides performance-driven drilling services with greater levels of accuracy, consistency, optimization and a reduction of human error to create higher quality wellbores. This technology addresses our customers' unique challenges, resulting in less tortuosity and reducing positional uncertainty in the directional drilling process. Another key benefit is that many components of our digital technology, including MOTIVE bit guidance and MagVARTM survey correction, can be used on any rig, regardless of the drilling or service provider, allowing our customers to benefit from these technologies on all rigs. During fiscal year 2019, H&P Technologies released AutoSlideSM, which integrates the MOTIVE bit guidance system and several FlexApps to function within the FlexRig operating system and fully automates the control of mud motors while sliding during the vertical, the curve, and the lateral hole sections during horizontal drilling operations. Similar to our approach with FlexApps, H&P Technologies plans to market AutoSlide across the FlexRigTM fleet initially at a price point that improves cost-efficiency for our customers. Subsequently, there are also plans to integrate the software to make this offering compatible with non–H&P rigs for those customers with multi-vendor rig fleets. Currently, our AutoSlide application is commercially available in four regions including the Midland, Bakken, Eagle Ford and MidCon basins and we will be expanding into additional basins in the coming months. The adoption of our FlexApps continues as customers see the value of these technologies as demonstrated by their requests to use them on both H&P and non-H&P rigs. Our preparation to respond to this type of demand includes migrating our FlexApp offerings into our H&P Technologies business segment, which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 and developing rig-neutral solutions to operate the software on non-H&P rigs. 
Other Operations
Other Operations include additional non-reportable operating segments.  Revenues included in “Other” consist primarily of real estate rental income. We own, develop and operate limited commercial real estate properties. Our real estate investments, which are located exclusively within Tulsa, Oklahoma, include a shopping center, multi‑tenant industrial warehouse properties, and undeveloped real estate.
We have also established a wholly-owned captive insurance company to insure various risks of our operating subsidiaries. The amount of actual cash investments held by the captive insurance company varies, depending on the amount of premiums paid to the captive insurance company, the timing and amount of claims paid by the captive insurance company, and the amount of dividends paid by the captive insurance company.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Company established an incubator program for new research and development projects, the results of which have been included in "Other" within our segment disclosures.
Internal Restructuring
During fiscal year 2019, we reorganized our active International Land drilling operations and our Offshore Drilling operations into separate, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Helmerich & Payne, Inc. through an internal restructuring transaction. This reorganization is intended to foster operational efficiency, simplify our organizational structure and provide additional clarity in our internal reporting. It had no impact on our segment reporting.
Rigs, Equipment, R&D, and Facilities
During the late 1990’s, we undertook a strategic initiative to develop a new generation drilling rig that would be the safest, fastest-moving and highest performing rig in the land drilling market. Our first “FlexRig®” entered the market in 1998. The original 18 rigs were designated as FlexRig1 and FlexRig2 rigs and were designed to drill wells with a depth of between 8,000 and 18,000 feet. From 2002 to 2004, we designed, built and delivered 32 of the next generation, AC drive rigs, known as “FlexRig3,” which incorporated new drilling technology and improved the safety and environmental design. The FlexRig3s found immediate success by delivering higher value wells to the customer and marked the beginning of the AC land rig revolution. We also changed our pricing and contracting strategy, and beginning in 2005, all new FlexRigs were built supported by a firm contract and attractive returns. To date, we have built 232 FlexRig3s and our strategy included building them under a multi-year term contract with substantial payback at attractive rates of return. An important part of our strategy was to design a rig that could support continuous improvement through upgrade capability of the hardware and software on the rigs to take advantage of technology improvements and lengthening the industry rig replacement cycle. These upgrades included, but were not limited to, enhanced drilling control 
systems and software, skid and walking systems for drilling multiple well pads, 7,500 psi mud systems, set back capacity to accommodate the pipe that the longer laterals demanded, and additional mud system capacity.
H&P has a strategic advantage due to our ability to utilize our AC rig design and operational and engineering expertise to exploit different well depths and designs that customers demand. In 2006, we introduced the FlexRig4, which was designed to efficiently drill shallower wells on multi-well pads. The FlexRig4 design offers two options that include trailerized or multi-well pad drilling capability, both of which incorporate additional environmental and safety by design improvements. While the trailerized FlexRig4 design provides for more efficient moves between individual well pads, the multi-well pad design uses a skidding capability that allows for drilling multiple wells from a single pad, which results in reduced environmental impact and increased production from a smaller footprint.
In 2011, we announced the introduction of the FlexRig5. The FlexRig5 was designed for deeper wells than the FlexRig4 and long lateral drilling of multiple wells from a single location and is designed for drilling horizontally in unconventional shale reservoirs. The new design preserves the key performance features of the FlexRig3 design but adds a bi-directional skidding system and equipment capacities suitable for wells in excess of 25,000 feet of measured depth. In 2017, we introduced our first walking rig by reconfiguring our skid designed FlexRig3s. Since then we have reconfigured, converted and upgraded a total of 40 FlexRigs to super-spec walking rigs.
H&P also has an important advantage in the super-spec space in that our FlexRig3s and FlexRig5s are ideally suited for super-spec upgrades, and we have more upgradeable rigs than our competitors. As of September 30, 2019, we held approximately 37 percent of the super-spec market share in U.S. land drilling. Our competency in design and construction allows us to efficiently upgrade our rigs to super-spec, and our financial strength enables us to continue such upgrades as long as market demand for such rigs remains high and there remains a supply of economically viable super-spec upgradable rigs. We do these upgrades at our fabrication facility in Houston, Texas.
Years of designing and building our fleet of AC drive FlexRigs has given us many competitive benefits. One key advantage is fleet uniformity. We have overseen the design and assembly of all of our AC FlexRigs, and our different rig classes share many common components.  We co-designed the control systems for our rigs and have the right to make any changes or modifications to those systems that we desire. A uniform fleet creates an adaptive environment to reach maximum efficiency for employees, equipment and technology and is critical to our ability to provide consistent, safe and reliable operations in increasingly complex basins. In addition, our fleet has greater scale than any other competitor, which enables us to upgrade our existing FlexRigs to super-spec in a capital efficient way. High levels of uniformity in crew training and rotation, as well as parts and supplies improve our cost-effectiveness, and our ability to control and remove safety exposures across a more standard fleet allows us to deliver higher performance in a safer and more reliable manner for the customer. Further, our fleet is supported by a Company-owned supply chain that provides standardized materials directly to the rigs from our regional warehouses.
A long-standing challenge in our industry is providing high quality and consistent results. In addressing the challenge of providing safe, high quality and consistent results, we utilize process excellence techniques that are developed internally. We provide experienced drilling and maintenance support for our operations, which provides value by reducing nonproductive time in our operations and improving drilling performance through our Center of Excellence (“COE”). The COE is manned 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with the ability to monitor and detect trends in drilling and drilling services performance onboard our rigs. Our monitoring group within the COE provides real-time help and feedback to our wellsite employees, as well as our customers, to fully optimize our operational performance. Additionally, our COE has a staff of performance engineers that work with our customers to enhance drilling program execution and overall drilling performance. The monitoring group and our performance engineers capture our drilling work steps to ensure we provide high quality and reliable results for our customers.
We currently have two facilities that provide vertically integrated solutions for drilling rig manufacturing, upgrades, retrofits and modifications, as well as overhauling, recertification, and repairs as it relates to our rigs and equipment. These facilities utilize lean manufacturing processes to enhance quality and efficiency as well as provide important insights in the maintenance and wear of equipment on our rigs. Our fabrication and assembly facility is located near Houston, Texas. Additionally, our overhauling, recertification, and repairs facility is located near Tulsa, Oklahoma.
During fiscal year 2018, we commercialized our FlexApp services, which include several new software applications that layer on top of our FlexRig drilling control systems. These applications are enabled by our uniform digital fleet and are designed to provide additional value to our customers’ well programs by providing a platform for machine-human collaboration during the drilling process to improve efficiency. The FlexApps can help play an important role in deploying our strategy as we strive towards autonomous drilling. 
The FlexApps that are currently in use include the following:

Application Name | Description 
FlexTorque™ | Hardware and software designed to decrease downhole drilling vibration and "slip-stick" during drilling. This helps with drilling efficiency and extends bit and downhole tool life, which is expected to reduce costly nonproductive time. 
Flex-Oscillator 2.0™ | Rig control software that automates drill string rotation during directional "slide" operations, which helps reduce downhole drag and the potential for stuck pipe. It also supports more effective directional drilling. 
FlexB2D™ | Software to engage and disengage the bit during connections in an established controlled and consistent manner allowing for better bit and downhole tool life, better drilling parameters and less costly bit trips out of the hole. 
FlexDrill 1.0™ | Software licensed from ExxonMobil to maximize the bit's rate of penetration, which we have automated, allowing the drilling control system to achieve the ideal mechanical specific energy at the bit. 
FlexGuide™ | Powered by both MOTIVE Drilling Technologies, Inc. ("MOTIVE") and MagVAR software that utilizes a drill bit guidance system and geomagnetic survey correction, respectively, improving wellbore quality with a scalable, repeatable data driven platform approach and helping to reduce surveying uncertainty, while increasing horizontal well economics and helping to reduce risk.

We have historically offered ancillary services, which are now referred to as FlexServices™. These services include trucking, surface equipment, casing running services and pipe rental.
Markets and Competition
Our business largely depends on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration and production activities. The level of capital spending is correlated to oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices can be volatile at times depending upon both near and long-term supply and demand factors. Sustained increases or decreases in the prices of oil and natural gas generally have a material impact on the exploration and production activities of our customers. As such, significant declines in the prices of oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  As of September 30, 2019, we had 218 rigs under contract, compared to 259 and 218 rigs under contract as of September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For further information concerning risks associated with our business, including volatility surrounding oil and natural gas prices and the impact of low oil prices on our business, see Item 1A— “Risk Factors” and Item 7— “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Form 10‑K.
Our industry is highly competitive, and we strive to differentiate our services based upon the quality of our FlexRigs and our engineering design expertise, operational efficiency, software technologies, and safety and environmental awareness. The number of available rigs generally exceeds demand in many of our markets, resulting in significant price competition. We compete against many drilling companies, some of whom are present in more than one of our operating regions. In the United States, we compete with Nabors Industries Ltd., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. and many other competitors with regional operations. Internationally, we compete directly with various contractors at each location where we operate. In the Gulf of Mexico platform rig market, we primarily compete with Nabors Industries Ltd. and Blake International Rigs, LLC.
Drilling Contracts
Our drilling contracts are obtained through competitive bidding or as a result of direct negotiations with customers. Our contracts vary in their terms and rates depending on the nature of the operations to be performed, the duration of the work, the amount and type of equipment and services provided, the geographic areas involved, market conditions and other variables. Our contracts often cover multi‑well and multi‑year projects. Except for a limited number of rigs operated under master agreements, each drilling rig operates under a separate drilling contract.
During fiscal year 2019, substantially all of our drilling services were performed on a “daywork” contract basis, under which we charged a rate per day, with the price determined by the location, depth and complexity of the well to be drilled, operating conditions, the duration of the contract, and the competitive forces of the market. We may also enter into contracts where we charge a fixed rate per foot of hole drilled to a stated depth, with a fixed rate per day for the remainder of the hole. Contracts performed on a “footage” basis generally involve a greater element of risk to the contractor compared to contracts performed on a “daywork” basis. Also, we may enter into “turnkey” contracts under which we charge a fixed sum to deliver a hole to a stated depth and agree to furnish services such as testing, coring and casing the hole which are not normally done on a “footage” basis. “Turnkey” contracts entail varying degrees of risk greater than the usual “footage” contract. We also actively pursue “performance daywork” contracts. These contracts typically have a lower dayrate portion and give us the opportunity to share in the well cost savings based on meeting or exceeding certain key performance indicators that are mutually agreed on by ourselves and our customers.
The duration of our drilling contracts are generally either “well‑to‑well” or for a fixed term. “Well‑to‑well” contracts can be terminated at the option of either party upon the completion of drilling of any one well. Fixed-term contracts generally have a minimum term of at least six months up to multiple years. These contracts customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer but may include an “early termination payment” to be paid to us if the contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, under certain limited circumstances such as destruction of a drilling rig, bankruptcy, sustained unacceptable performance by us or delivery of a rig beyond certain grace and/or liquidated damage periods, no early termination payment would be paid to us.
Contracts generally contain renewal or extension provisions exercisable at the option of the customer at prices mutually agreeable to us and the customer. In most instances, contracts provide for additional payments for mobilization and demobilization of the rig.
Contract Backlog
As of September 30, 2019, and 2018, our drilling contract backlog, being the expected future dayrate revenue from executed contracts, was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Approximately 25 percent of the total September 30, 2019 backlog is reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal year 2021 and thereafter. Included in backlog is early termination revenue expected to be recognized after the periods presented in which early termination notice was received prior to the end of the period. 
The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the percentage of the September 30, 2019 backlog reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal year 2021 and thereafter:

(in billions) | September 30, 2019 | | September 30, 2018 | 
U.S. Land | $ | 1.0 | | | $ | 0.9 | | 21.4 | %
Offshore | — | | | — | | | — 
International Land | 0.2 | | | 0.2 | | | 47.5
 | $ | 1.2 | | | $ | 1.1 | | | 

We do not have material long-term contracts related to our H&P Technologies segment. As noted above, under certain limited circumstances a customer is not required to pay an early termination fee. There may also be instances where a customer is financially unable or refuses to pay an early termination fee. In addition, contract terms could be modified or extended after the initial contract is signed. Accordingly, the actual amount of revenue earned may vary from the backlog reported. For further information, see Item 1A— “Risk Factors — Our current backlog of contract drilling services revenue may continue to decline and may not be ultimately realized as fixed‑term contracts may in certain instances be terminated without an early termination payment.”
Employees
Our core values reflect who we are and the way our employees interact with one another, our customers, partners and shareholders. Our first core value of Actively C.A.R.E. means that we treat one another with respect. We care about each other, and from a safety perspective, our employees are committed to Controlling and Removing Exposures for themselves and others. Our core value of Service Attitude means that we do our part and more for those around us. We consider the needs of others and provide solutions to meet their needs. Our third core value, Innovative Spirit means that we constantly work to improve and are willing to try new approaches. We make decisions with the long–term view in mind. Finally, our core value of teamwork means that we listen to one another and work toward a common goal. We collaborate to achieve results and focus on success for our customers and shareholders.
As of September 30, 2019, we had 7,767 employees within the United States (17 of whom were part‑time employees) and 743 employees in international operations. The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services. We consider our employee relations to be robust. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a union. However, some of our international employees are unionized.
Insurance and Risk Management
Our operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including personal injury and death, environmental, and weather risks, which could expose us to significant losses and damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us. Furthermore, if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our drilling contracts contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, pollution and reservoir damage. However, our contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts by us, or subcontractors and/or suppliers or by reason of state anti-indemnity laws. Our customers and other third parties may also dispute these indemnification provisions, or we may be unable to transfer these risks to our drilling customers or other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements.
We insure working land rigs and related equipment at values that approximate the current replacement costs on the inception date of the policies. However, we self-insure large deductibles under these policies. We also carry insurance with varying deductibles and coverage limits with respect to stacked rigs, offshore platform rigs, and “named wind storm” risk in the Gulf of Mexico.
We have insurance coverage for comprehensive general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability, and certain other specific risks. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. We retain a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability programs. We self-insure a number of other risks including loss of earnings and business interruption and most cyber risks. We are unable to obtain significant amounts of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
Our insurance may not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits. No assurance can be given that all or a portion of our coverage will not be canceled, that insurance coverage will continue to be available at rates considered reasonable or that our coverage will respond to a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from our insurers or our insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.
Government Regulations
Our operations are subject to a variety of national, state, local and international environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, treaties and conventions. We monitor our compliance with environmental regulations in each country of operation and generally have seen an increase in environmental regulation. We have made and will continue to make the required expenditures to comply with current and future environmental requirements. We do not anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental rules and regulations and required controls will significantly change our competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2020, as these regulations are generally imposed on exploration and production companies instead of contract drilling services companies. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations and that the cost of such compliance is not material to our business or financial condition. For a more detailed description of the environmental rules and regulations applicable to our operations, see Item 1A— “Risk Factors — Failure to comply with or changes to governmental and environmental laws could adversely affect our business.”
Sustainability
At the direction of the oil and gas exploration and production companies we work with, we contract to drill oil and gas wells. The exploration and production companies determine whether and when to extract those resources from the ground, following completion of the well. Below are summaries of what we do and what we do not do, the latter of which is provided because it is often incorrectly assumed that our operations overlap with exploration and production, midstream and downstream parts of the oil and gas sector in ways they do not.
What We Do

• | Strive to make drilling for oil and gas safer and more efficient


• | Build and renovate drilling rigs at two industrial facilities in Texas and Oklahoma


• | Oversee drilling operations on our rigs on customer sites


• | Drill predominantly on-shore in the U.S.

What We Do Not Do

• | Hydraulic fracturing


• | Buy, lease, prepare, manage or restore land on which rigs are located, or have responsibility for the protection of wildlife or biodiversity of our customers’ properties


• | Pump or extract oil or gas from the ground


• | Procure, transport or pump water underground, or treat, store, manage or remove waste water from the drilling sites, or arrange for its disposal


• | Assume responsibility for the prevention of fugitive releases or emissions associated with the oil and gas exploration or production process


• | Engage in oil and gas transport, refining or storage


• | Engage in downstream operations

Thus, many of the environmental and safety risks associated with the oil and gas sector fall outside the scope of our operations and areas of responsibility. Our most critical responsibility is therefore the safety of our employees and the employees of our customers. To be successful, we strive to be leaders in innovation, technology, cost competitiveness, safety, customer service, relationship tending, and reputation management.  To maintain this leadership edge and generate shareholder value, we invest in our employees, customers, communities, and other stakeholders in the ways listed below.
Recruiting
Our recruiting practices and decisions on whom to hire are among our most important activities. In addition to traditional school recruiting events, we utilize social media and local job fairs across the U.S. to find diverse, motivated and responsible employees.
Education and Training
We strive to create a culture and work environment that enables us to attract, train, promote, and retain a diverse group of talented employees who together can help us gain a competitive advantage. We are dedicated to the continual training and development of our employees, especially of those in field operations, to ensure we can develop future managers and leaders from within our organization. Our organizational development team has responsibility for talent management as well ongoing training and development, including development and succession plans, mentoring and change management initiatives, and diversity and inclusion programs. Our training starts right at the beginning with good on–boarding procedures that focus on safety, responsibility, ethical conduct and inclusive teamwork.
In addition to on–boarding training, we provide extensive ongoing training and career development focused on:


• | compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") and laws applicable to our business including:


▪ | the importance of creating an inclusive environment that encourages the best out of all employees and avoids illegal discrimination


▪ | the importance of individual responsibility in meeting our Code's requirements and taking action when needed, including reporting


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, trade controls and anti–boycott training for appropriate employees (the H&P FCPA Policy, which prohibits facilitation payments, can be found on our website)


• | skills and competencies directly related to employees' positions


• | commitment to an incident–free work environment


• | responsibility for personal safety and the safety of fellow employees, others on location and the environment

Our Educational Assistance Plan offers reimbursement of tuition fees for any employee pursuing an undergraduate degree and, in some cases, post–graduate degrees. 
Health and Welfare
We support our employees’ and their families’ health with full medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees and their families, life insurance and long-term disability plans, and health and dependent care flexible spending accounts. We foster teamwork and a sense of community amongst our employees through our H&P Way Fund that provides assistance to employees and their families experiencing emergencies.
Retirement
We provide a 401(k) plan with a company match.
Safety
All of our safety programs are designed to comply with applicable laws and industry standards as well as to benefit employees, customers and communities. We have a dedicated Health, Safety and Environmental (“HSE”) function overseen by senior executives and implemented at every H&P drilling rig and facility worldwide. Our safety-focused C.A.R.E. program promotes employee and customer safety and well-being. In addition, our H&P Technologies segment is investing in digital technology safety solutions for the purpose of controlling and removing exposures on FlexRigs. We incorporate safety features into our rig designs through our Safety by Design program. The success of our safety initiatives, including our C.A.R.E. and Safety by Design programs, and the Company’s performance with respect to safety metrics are important elements of the compensation of our executives, as discussed further in our proxy statement. 
Our Safety by Design program helps us:

• | Identify and work to eliminate hazards in the rig design phase


• | Use leading-edge technology to enhance efficiency and thus reduce the number and severity of safety risks


• | Standardize designs, which can reduce the variability in the types of rigs we use to allow our employees to have a greater familiarity with the rigs than would be achieved if they had to master a wider variety of rig types


• | Design and configure loads and interconnects with rig moves in mind. By striving to integrate equipment to the greatest extent possible, we minimize risks associated with moves and risks associated with double handling

Our COE promotes process excellence and safety by providing experienced drilling and maintenance real-time support around the clock to our operations.  Our COE Call Center and Real-Time Monitoring Groups are staffed with experienced systems technicians who work with field personnel to leverage each group’s knowledge in troubleshooting rig events.  In addition, experienced engineers monitor safety critical alarms and perform daily safety performance and data analysis throughout the fleet.
In the event that an operational incident does occur, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive Emergency Management and Crisis Response Plan to help ensure H&P has the ability to respond promptly and effectively to the most severe adverse situations or crises.
Environmental Management
H&P does not itself lease properties used for the operations of our customers.  However, many of our customers operate in regions that have stringent safety and environmental laws and regulations, with which we comply as applicable. The standards we employ include:

• | Applying industry-accepted environmental best practices


• | Minimizing rig physical footprints, and using technology to configure drilling rigs, where appropriate, for space efficient multi-well pads, all to minimize the impact on the environment in which we and our customers operate


• | Conversion of many of our rigs to allow partial substitution of cleaner burning natural gas as a fuel source to reduce air emissions


• | Upgrading our drilling rig fleet to utilize AC drive power and control systems which are more energy efficient and have significantly lower noise levels as compared to SCR and mechanical drilling rigs


• | Using a variety of recycling and other initiatives in our facilities and operations to minimize waste

Ethics and Compliance
We expect corporate, professional and personal responsibility from each of our employees as well as compliance with high ethical standards to achieve operational excellence. In addition to the corporate governance oversight provided by the Board of Directors and its committees, management observes and enforces our Code described on our website. Our Code provides employees with the tools to make consistent, ethical decisions and emphasizes the duty to report any concerns or violations.
In addition to our Code, we have and enforce a Code of Ethics for Principal Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers and a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Compliance Policy. We foster a culture of trust and transparency and frequently remind our employees that they are encouraged to ask questions and report concerns. To empower every employee to promote responsible behavior, we have implemented an independent and anonymous reporting mechanism for employees to voice concerns pertaining to our Code, policies or compliance with law without fear of retaliation. Our Ethics Hotline, administered by a third–party, provides a convenient and confidential channel for employees and non-employees to report any suspected compliance concerns or complaints.
We believe this focus on finding and getting the best out of our people, our programs, our standards and our technology collectively support our operations, our reputation and our returns.
