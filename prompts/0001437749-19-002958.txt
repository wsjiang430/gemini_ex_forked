ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General Development of Business
 
National HealthCare Corporation, which we also refer to as NHC or the Company, began business in 1971. Our principal business is the operation of skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, independent living facilities and homecare programs. Our business activities include providing sub–acute and post–acute skilled nursing care, intermediate nursing care, rehabilitative care, memory and Alzheimer’s care, senior living services, and home health care services. We have a non–controlling ownership interest in a hospice care business that services NHC owned health care centers and others. In addition, we provide management services, accounting and financial services, as well as insurance services to third party operators of health care facilities. We also own the real estate of 13 healthcare properties and lease these properties to third party operators. We operate in 10 states, and our owned and leased properties are located in the Southeastern, Northeastern, and Midwestern parts of the United States.
 
Narrative Description of the Business
 
At December 31, 2018, we operated or managed 75 skilled nursing facilities with a total of 9,510 licensed beds. These numbers include 28 facilities that are owned with 3,632 beds, 39 facilities that are leased with 4,963 beds, and eight facilities that are managed for others with 915 beds. Of the 39 leased facilities, 35 are leased from National Health Investors, Inc. ("NHI").
 
Our 24 assisted living facilities (twelve owned, nine leased, and three managed) have 1,132 units (884 units owned, 205 units leased, and 43 units managed).
 
Our five independent living facilities (one owned, three leased, and one managed) have 475 retirement apartments (93 apartments owned, 245 apartments leased, and 137 apartments managed).
 
We acquired a controlling ownership interest in a 14-bed behavioral health hospital in August 2018. This hospital specializes in geriatric behavioral health and is the only behavioral health hospital the Company currently operates.
 
We operated 35 homecare programs licensed in three states (Tennessee, South Carolina, and Florida) and provided 387,798 homecare patient visits in 2018.
 
We have a partnership agreement and a 75.1% non–controlling ownership interest in Caris Healthcare, LP (“Caris”), a business that specializes in hospice care services in NHC owned health care centers and in other settings. Caris provides hospice care to over 1,000 patients per day in 28 locations in Georgia, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.
 
We operate specialized care units within some of our healthcare facilities such as Alzheimer's disease care units and sub–acute nursing units. Similar specialty units are under consideration at several of our facilities, as well as free standing projects.
 
Net Patient Revenues. Health care services we provide include a comprehensive range of services. In fiscal 2018, 95.1% of our net operating revenues were derived from such health care services. Highlights of health care services activities during 2018 were as follows:
Skilled Nursing Facilities. The most significant portion of our business and the base for our other health care services is the operation of our skilled nursing facilities (“SNF’s”). In our facilities, experienced medical professionals provide medical services prescribed by physicians. Registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and certified nursing assistants provide comprehensive, individualized nursing care 24 hours a day. In addition, our facilities provide licensed therapy services, quality nutrition services, social services, activities, and housekeeping and laundry services. Revenues from the 67 facilities we own or lease are reported as net patient revenues in our financial statements. Management fee income is recorded as other revenues from the eight facilities that we manage. We generally charge 6% of facility net operating revenues for our management services.
 
The following table shows the occupancy rates for our owned and leased skilled nursing facilities:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
---------------+-------------------------+-----
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Overall census | | 89.8 | % | | 90.2 | % | 89.5 | %

Rehabilitative Services. We provide therapy services through Professional Health Services, a subsidiary of NHC. Our licensed therapists provide physical, speech, respiratory and occupational therapy for patients recovering from strokes, heart attacks, orthopedic conditions, neurological illnesses, or other illnesses, injuries or disabilities. We maintained a rehabilitation staff of over 1,800 highly trained, professional therapists in 2018. Most of our rehabilitative services are for patients in our owned and managed skilled nursing facilities. However, we also provide services to over 70 additional health care providers. Our rates for these services are competitive with other market rates.

Medical Specialty Units. All our skilled nursing facilities participate in the Medicare program, and we have expanded our range of offerings by the creation of center–specific medical specialty units such as our memory care units and subacute nursing units. Our trained staff provides care for Alzheimer’s patients in early, middle and advanced stages of the disease. We provide specialized care and programs for persons with Alzheimer’s or related disorders in dedicated units within many of our skilled nursing facilities. Our specialized rehabilitation programs are designed to shorten or eliminate hospital stays and help to reduce the cost of quality health care. We develop individualized patient care plans to target appropriate medical and functional planning objectives with a primary goal where feasible for a return to home or a similar environment.
Assisted Living Facilities. Our assisted living facilities provide personal care services and assistance with general activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing, meal preparation and medication management. We perform resident assessments to determine what services are desired or required and our qualified staff encourages residents to participate in a range of activities. In 2018, the rate of occupancy was 78.7%. The occupancy rate for 2018 is lower primarily due to the two newly constructed assisted living facilities that began operations during 2017. Certificates of Need (“CONs”) are not required to build these projects in most states and we believe overbuilding has occurred in some of our markets.
Independent Living Facilities. Our independent living facilities offer specially designed residential units for the active and ambulatory elderly and provide various ancillary services for our residents, including restaurants, activity rooms and social areas. Charges for services are paid from private sources without assistance from governmental programs. Independent living centers may be licensed and regulated in some states, but do not require the issuance of a CON such as is required for skilled nursing facilities. We have, in several cases, developed independent living centers adjacent to our nursing facilities with an initial construction of 40 to 80 units. These units are rented by the month; thus, these centers offer an expansion of our continuum of care. We believe these independent living units offer a positive marketing aspect to all of our senior care offerings and services.
 
We have one independent living facility which is a "continuing care community", where the resident pays a substantial entrance fee and a monthly maintenance fee. The resident then receives a full range of services, including home health nursing, without additional charge.
 
Homecare Programs. Our home health care programs (“homecares”) assist those who wish to stay at home or in assisted living residences but still require some degree of medical care or assistance with daily activities. Registered and licensed practical nurses and therapy professionals provide skilled services such as infusion therapy, wound care and physical, occupational and speech therapies. Home health aides may assist with daily activities such as assistance with walking and getting in and out of bed, personal hygiene, medication assistance, light housekeeping and maintaining a safe environment. Under the Medicare reimbursement payment system, we receive a prospectively determined amount per patient per 60-day episode. Under our managed care contracts, we may receive a 60-day episode payment or be paid by a per-visit payment model. Medicare episodes in 2018 were 16,436. In 2018, we served an average census of 3,652 patients and provided 387,798 visits.
Pharmacy Operations. At December 31, 2018, we operated four regional pharmacy locations (two locations in Tennessee and one location each in South Carolina and Missouri). These pharmacies primarily service our patients that are in an inpatient setting using a central location to deliver pharmaceutical supplies. Our regional pharmacies bill Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) electronically and directly for inpatients who have selected a PDP.
Other Revenues. We generate revenues from management, accounting and financial services to third party operators of healthcare facilities, from insurance services to our managed healthcare facilities, and from rental income. In fiscal 2018, 4.9% of our net operating revenues were derived from such sources. The significant sources of our other revenues are described as follows:

A. | Management, Accounting and Financial Services. We provide management services to skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and independent living facilities operated by third party operators. We typically charge 6% of the managed centers’ net operating revenues as a fee for these services. Additionally, we provide accounting and financial services to other healthcare operators. No management services are provided for entities in which we provide accounting and financial services. As of December 31, 2018, we perform management services for twelve healthcare facilities (ten management contracts for third parties and two management contracts where we have an equity method investment) and accounting and financial services for 20 healthcare facilities.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


B. | Insurance Services. NHC owns a Tennessee domestic licensed insurance company. The company is licensed in several states and provides workers’ compensation coverage to substantially all NHC's managed healthcare facilities. A second wholly-owned insurance subsidiary is licensed in the Cayman Islands and provides general and professional liability coverage in substantially all of NHC’s owned and managed healthcare facilities.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


C. | Rental Income. The healthcare properties currently owned and leased to third party operators include nine skilled nursing facilities and four assisted living communities.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Non–Operating Income. We generate non–operating income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments, from dividends and realized gains and losses on marketable securities, interest income, and other miscellaneous non–operating income. The significant source of non–operating income is described as follows:
 
Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investments. Earnings from investments in entities in which we lack control but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for on the equity method. Our most significant equity method investment is a 75.1% non–controlling ownership interest in Caris, a business that specializes in hospice care services in NHC owned health care centers and in other settings. Caris currently has 28 locations serving five states (Georgia, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia).

Quality of Patient Care
 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) introduced the Five-Star Quality Rating System to help consumers, their families and caregivers compare skilled nursing facilities more easily. The Five-Star Quality Rating System gives each skilled nursing operation a rating of between one and five stars in various categories (five stars being the best). The Company has always strived for patient-centered care and quality outcomes as precursors to outstanding financial performance. The average Five-Star rating for all of our skilled nursing facilities was 4.32 for 2018. The table below summarizes our performance in these quality ratings for the most recent three years:

 | As of December 31, | 
------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------+---
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Total number of skilled nursing facilities, end of year | | 75 | | | 76 | | 74 | 
Number of 4 and 5-star rated skilled nursing facilities | | 63 | | | 62 | | 54 | 
Percentage of 4 and 5-star rated skilled nursing facilities | | 84 | % | | 82 | % | 73 | %

Development and Growth
 
We are undertaking to expand our post–acute and senior health care operations while protecting our existing operations and markets. The following table lists our recent construction and purchase activities.

Type of Operation | Description | Size | Location | Placed in Service
---------------------------+--------------+--------------------+------------------+------------------
SNF | Bed Addition | 44 beds | Charleston, SC | May, 2016

Business Segments
 
The Company has two reportable operating segments: (1) inpatient services, which includes the operation of skilled nursing facilities, assisted and independent living facilities, and the one behavioral health hospital, and (2) homecare services. The Company also reports an “all other” category that includes revenues from rental income, management and accounting services fees, insurance services, and costs of the corporate office. See Note 5 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure of the Company’s operating segments.
 

Customers and Sources of Revenues
 
No individual customer, or related group of customers, accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. We do not expect the loss of a single customer or group of related customers would have a material adverse effect.
 
Certain groups of patients receive funds to pay the cost of their care from a common source. The following table sets forth sources of net patient revenues for the periods indicated:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
----------------------+-------------------------+----
Source | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
Medicare | | 35 | % | | 35 | % | 37 | %
Managed Care | | 12 | % | | 13 | % | 12 | %
Medicaid | | 26 | % | | 26 | % | 26 | %
Private Pay and Other | | 27 | % | | 26 | % | 25 | %
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
We attempt to attract an increased percentage of Medicare, managed care, and private pay patients by providing rehabilitative and other post–acute care services. These services are designed to speed the patient's recovery and allow the patient to return home as soon as it is practical.
 
Medicare is a health insurance program for the aged and certain other chronically disabled individuals operated by the federal government. Medicare covers skilled nursing services for beneficiaries who require nursing care and/or rehabilitation services following a hospitalization of at least three consecutive days. For each eligible day a Medicare beneficiary is in a skilled nursing facility, Medicare pays the facility a daily payment, subject to adjustment for certain factors such as a wage index in the geographic area. The payment covers all services provided by the skilled nursing facility for the beneficiary that day, including room and board, nursing, therapy and drugs, as well as an estimate of capital–related costs to deliver those services.
Medicaid is a medical assistance program for the indigent, operated by individual states with the financial participation of the federal government. The states in which we operate currently use prospective cost–based reimbursement systems. Under cost–based reimbursement systems, the skilled nursing facility is reimbursed for the reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs it incurred in a base year in providing routine resident care services as defined by the program.

Private pay, managed care, and other payment sources include commercial insurance, individual patient funds, managed care plans and the Veterans Administration. Although payment rates vary among these sources, market forces and costs largely determine these rates. Private paying patients, private insurance carriers and the Veterans Administration generally pay based on the center's charges or specifically negotiated contracts.
 
We contract with over 60 managed care organizations ("MCO's") and insurance carriers for the provision of sub-acute and other medical specialty services by our owned and managed healthcare facilities.
 
Regulation and Licenses
 
Health care is an area of extensive regulatory oversight and frequent regulatory change. The federal government and the states in which we operate regulate various aspects of our business. These regulatory bodies, among other things, require us annually to license our skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities in some states and other health care businesses, including home health. To operate nursing facilities and provide health care services we must comply with federal, state and local laws relating to the delivery and adequacy of medical care, distribution of pharmaceuticals, equipment, personnel, operating policies, fire prevention, rate–setting, building codes and environmental protection.  Changes in the laws or new interpretations of existing laws as applied to the skilled nursing facilities, the assisted living facilities or other components of our health care businesses, may have a significant impact on our operations. 
 
Governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies to assure that we continue to comply with their various standards. We must pass these inspections to continue our licensing under state law, to obtain certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and to continue our participation in the Veterans Administration program. We can only participate in other third–party programs if our facilities pass these inspections. In addition, these authorities inspect our record keeping and inventory control.
 
From time to time, we, like others in the health care industry, may receive notices from federal and state regulatory agencies alleging that we failed to comply with applicable standards. These notices may require us to take corrective action and may impose civil money penalties and/or other operating restrictions. If our skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies fail to comply with these directives or otherwise fail to comply substantially with licensure and certification laws, rules and regulations, we could lose our certification as a Medicare and Medicaid provider and/or lose our licenses.
 
Local and state health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities specific to their location regulate, to varying degrees, our assisted living facilities. Although regulations and licensing requirements vary significantly from state to state, they typically address, among other things, personnel education, training and records; facility services, including administration of medication, assistance with supervision of medication management and limited nursing services; physical plant specifications; furnishing of resident units; food and housekeeping services; emergency evacuation plans; and resident rights and responsibilities. If assisted living facilities fail to comply with licensing requirements, these facilities could lose their licenses. Most states also subject assisted living facilities to state or local building codes, fire codes and food service licensure or certification requirements. In addition, the manner and extent to which the assisted living industry is regulated at federal and state levels are evolving.
 
In all states in which we operate, before a skilled nursing facility can make a capital expenditure exceeding certain specified amounts or construct any new skilled health care beds, approval of the state health care regulatory agency or agencies must be obtained, and a Certificate of Need issued. The appropriate state health planning agency must review the Certificate of Need according to state specific guidelines before a Certificate of Need can be issued. A Certificate of Need is generally issued for a specific maximum amount of expenditure and the project must be completed within a specific time period. There is no advance assurance that we will be able to obtain a Certificate of Need in any instance. In some states, approval is also necessary in order to purchase existing health care beds, although the purchaser is normally permitted to avoid a full-scale Certificate of Need application procedure by giving advance written notice of the acquisition and giving written assurance to the state regulatory agency that the change of ownership will not result in a change in the number of beds, services offered and, in some cases, reimbursement rates at the facility.
 
While there are currently no significant legislative proposals to eliminate Certificates of Need pertaining to skilled nursing care in the states in which we do business, deregulation in the Certificate of Need area would likely result in increased competition and could adversely affect occupancy rates and the supply of licensed and certified personnel.
 
Medicare and Medicaid Participation
 
All skilled nursing facilities, owned, leased or managed by us are certified to participate in Medicare. All but eight (seven owned and one managed) of our affiliated skilled nursing facilities participate in Medicaid. All of our homecare offices participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with Medicare comprising the majority of their revenue.
 
During the fiscal years, we received payments from Medicare and, if participating, from Medicaid. We record as receivables the amounts we ultimately expect to receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs and record into profit or loss any differences in amounts received at the time of interim or final settlements. Adjustments have not had a material adverse effect within the last three years.
 
Certifications and Participation Requirements; Efforts to Impose Reduced Payments
 
Changes in certification and participation requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs have restricted, and are likely to continue to restrict further, eligibility for reimbursement under those programs. Failure to obtain and maintain Medicare and Medicaid certification at our skilled nursing facilities would result in denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments which would likely result in a significant loss of revenue. In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding that providers accept discounted payments resulting in lost revenue for specific patients. Efforts to impose reduced payments, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue. Any reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. We are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on our operations. No assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on us.

Medicare Legislation and Regulations
 
Health Care Reform 

The health care industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and other influences, along with the various scientific and technological initiatives.  In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect major change within the U.S. health care system, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the "ACA") which represents significant changes to the current U.S. health care system (collectively the "Acts").  However, the law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges.  The presidential administration and a number of members of Congress have stated their intent to repeal or make additional significant changes to the ACA, its implementation or interpretation.  Effective January 1, 2019, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance.  In December 2018, as a result of the penalty associated with the individual mandate being eliminated, a federal judge in Texas found that the entire ACA was unconstitutional.  However, the law remains in place pending appeal.  Additionally, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the ACA.  These changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased.
 
Since a significant goal of federal health care reform is to transform the delivery of health care by holding providers accountable for the cost and quality of care provided, Medicare and many commercial third-party payors are implementing Accountable Care Organization ("ACO") models in which groups of providers share in the benefit and risk of providing care to an assigned group of individuals. Other reimbursement methodology reforms in which we are participating or expect to participate in include value–based purchasing, in which a portion of provider reimbursement is redistributed based on relative performance on designated economic, clinical quality, and patient satisfaction metrics. Also, CMS is implementing demonstration programs to bundle acute care and post–acute care reimbursement to hold providers accountable for costs across a broader continuum of care. These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in public and commercial health plans. Providers who respond successfully to these trends and can deliver quality care at lower costs are likely to benefit financially.
 
Skilled Nursing Facilities 
 
Medicare is uniform nationwide and reimburses nursing centers under a fixed payment methodology named the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System ("SNF PPS"). SNF PPS is an acuity-based classification system that uses nursing and therapy indexes adjusted by geographical wage indexes to calculate per diem rates for each Medicare patient. Payment rates are updated annually and are generally increased or decreased each October when the federal fiscal year begins. The acuity classification system is named RUGs (Resource Utilization Groups IV). At December 31, 2018, there are 66 classifications of RUG groups.
 
On August 8, 2018, CMS issued a final rule outlining fiscal year 2019 Medicare payments and quality changes for skilled nursing facilities. The 2019 final rule, which began October 1, 2018, provided for an approximate 2.4% market basket update that was spelled out in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The market basket increase is expected to increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year 2019 by $820 million compared to fiscal year 2018 levels.
 
As part of the final rule and effective October 1, 2019, CMS plans to start using a new case-mix model, called the Patient-Driven Payment Model (“PDPM”), which focuses on a resident’s condition and care needs, rather than the amount of care provided, to determine reimbursement levels. The PDPM utilizes clinically relevant factors for determining Medicare payment by using ICD-10 diagnosis codes and other patient characteristics as the basis for patient classification. PDPM utilizes five case-mix adjusted payment components: physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT), speech language pathology (SLP), nursing and social services (nursing) and non-therapy ancillary services (NTA). It also uses a sixth non-case mix component to cover utilization of SNF resources that do not vary depending on resident characteristics.
 
PDPM will replace the existing case-mix classification methodology, Resource Utilization Groups, Version IV. The structure of the PDPM moves Medicare towards a more value-based, unified post-acute care payment system. PDPM also removes therapy minutes as the basis for therapy payment and adjusts the SNF per diem payments to reflect varying costs throughout the stay, through the PT, OT and NTA components. In addition, PDPM is intended to reduce paperwork requirements for performing patient assessments. Under the new PDPM system, the payment to skilled nursing facilities will be based heavily on the patient’s condition rather than the specific services provided by each skilled nursing facility.
 
Homecares (HHAs)
 
Medicare is uniform nationwide and reimburses homecares under a fixed payment methodology named the Home Health Prospective Payment System ("HH PPS"). Generally, Medicare makes payments under the HH PPS based on a national standardized 60–day episode payment, adjusted for case mix and geographical wage index. Payment rates are updated at the beginning of each calendar year. The acuity classification system is named HHRGs (Home Health Resource Groups).
 
On November 13, 2018, CMS published a final rule which updates the Medicare HH PPS rates, including the conversion factor and case-mix weights for calendar years 2019 and 2020. Effective January 1, 2019, CMS estimates the net impact of the PPS rule results in a 2.2% increase ($420 million) in Medicare payments for agencies in 2019. The increase reflects the effects of a 2.2% home health payment update percentage; a 0.1% increase in payments due to decreasing the fixed-dollar-loss ratio in order to pay no more than 2.5% of total payments as outlier payments; and a 0.1% decrease in payments due to the new rural add-on policy mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.
 
Also published in the final rule and effective January 1, 2020, there will be an elimination of therapy thresholds for payment, implementation of the Patient-Driven Group Model (“PDGM”) case-mix methodology refinements and a change in the unit of payment from a sixty (60) day episode to a thirty (30) day episode period. These changes focus on providing value over volume of services to patients. Once the changes are implemented, home health payments will no longer be based on the number of visits provided, but rather the patient’s medical condition and care needs.
 

Medicaid Legislation and Regulations
 
Skilled Nursing Facilities 
 
State Medicaid plans subject to budget constraints are of particular concern to us. Changes in federal funding coupled with state budget problems and Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act have produced an uncertain environment. States will more likely than not be unable to keep pace with post-acute healthcare inflation. States are under pressure to pursue other alternatives to skilled nursing care such as community and home–based services.
 
 7


Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under approved plans.  Most state Medicaid payments are made under a prospective payment system or under programs which negotiate payment levels with individual providers.  The ACA, as currently structured, requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes effectively at or below 138% of the federal poverty level.  However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding.  Some states use, or have applied to use, waivers granted by CMS to implement expansion, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions, or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards.  The presidential administration and a number of members of Congress have indicated their intent to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including allowing states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement. 
 
Effective July 1, 2018 and for the fiscal year 2019, the state of Tennessee implemented specific individual nursing facility rate increases. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2019 fiscal year will be approximately $2,100,000 annually, or $525,000 per quarter.
 
Effective October 1, 2018 and for the fiscal year 2019, South Carolina implemented specific individual nursing facility rate changes. The resulting increase in revenue beginning October 1, 2018 will be approximately $2,200,000 annually, or $550,000 per quarter.
 
Effective July 1, 2018 and for the fiscal year 2019, the state of Missouri approved a Medicaid rate increase of $7.76 per patient day to Missouri skilled nursing providers. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue for the 2019 fiscal year will be approximately $2,000,000 annually, or $500,000 per quarter.
 
Competition
 
In most of the communities in which we operate health care centers, we compete with other health care centers in the area. We operate 75 skilled nursing facilities located in nine states, all of which require a certificate of need prior to the opening of any new skilled nursing facilities.  There are hundreds of operators of skilled nursing facilities in each of these states and no single operator, including us, dominates any of these state’s skilled nursing care markets, except for some small rural markets which might have only one skilled nursing facility. In competing for patients and staff with these facilities, we depend upon referrals from acute care hospitals, physicians, residential care facilities, church groups and other community service organizations. The reputation in the community and the physical appearance of our facilities are important in obtaining patients, since members of the patient’s family generally participate to a greater extent in selecting skilled nursing facilities than in selecting an acute care hospital. We believe that by providing and emphasizing rehabilitative as well as skilled care services at our facilities, we can broaden our patient base and to differentiate our facilities from competing skilled nursing facilities.
 
As we continue to expand into the assisted living market, we monitor proposed or existing competing assisted living centers. Our development goal is to link our skilled nursing facilities with our assisted living centers, thereby obtaining a competitive advantage for both.
 
Our homecare agencies compete with other home health agencies (HHA’s) in most communities we serve. Competition occurs for patients and employees. Our homecare agencies depend on hospital and physician referrals and reputation to maintain a healthy census.
 
We experience competition in employing and retaining nurses, technicians, aides and other high quality professional and non–professional employees. To enhance our competitive position, we have an educational tuition loan program, an American Dietetic Association approved internship program, a specially designed nurse's aide training class, and we make financial scholarship aid available to physical therapy vocational programs. We support the Foundation for Geriatric Education. We also conduct an "Administrator in Training" course, which is 24 months in duration, for the professional training of administrators. Presently, we have six full–time individuals in this program. Two of our three regional senior vice presidents, three regional vice presidents, one regional administrator, and 53 of our 75 health care center administrators are graduates of this program.
 
We experience competition in providing management and accounting services to other senior health care providers. Those services are provided primarily to owners with whom we have had previous involvement through ownership or leasing arrangements. Our insurance services are provided primarily to healthcare facilities for which we also provide management and/or accounting services.
 
Our employee benefit package offers a tuition reimbursement program. The goal of the program is to ensure a well–trained qualified work force to meet future demands. While the program is offered to all disciplines, special emphasis has been placed on supporting students in nursing and physical therapy programs. Students are reimbursed at the end of each semester after presenting tuition receipts and grades to management. The program has been successful in providing a means for many bright students to pursue a formal education.
 

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, our Administrative Services Contractor (National Health Corporation) had 14,891 full and part time employees, who we call "Partners". No employees are represented by a bargaining unit. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.
Investor Information

We are subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. Consequently, we are required to file reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including reports on the following forms: annual report on Form 10–K, quarterly reports on Form 10–Q, current reports on Form 8–K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. These reports and other information concerning our company may be accessed through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
 
You may also find on our website at www.nhccare.com electronic copies of our annual reports on Form 10–K, quarterly reports on Form 10–Q, current reports on Form 8–K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as well as all press releases. We do not necessarily have these posted the same day as they are filed with the SEC or released to the public, but rather have a policy of placing these on the web site within two (2) business days of public release or SEC filing. All such filings are available free of charge. Information contained in our website is not deemed to be a part of this Annual Report.
