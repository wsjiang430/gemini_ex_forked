Our Markets
The global interactive technology education industry is undergoing a significant transition, as primary and secondary school districts, colleges and universities, as well as governments, corporations and individuals around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of using technology to more effectively educate, communicate and collaborate. Across the globe, state governments along with local communities continue to make sustained investments in education.
The K-12 education sector represents one of the largest industry segments. The US sector is comprised of approximately 15,600 public school districts across the 50 states and 132,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools. In addition to its size, the U.S. and certain EMEA K-12 education markets are highly decentralized and are characterized by complex content adoption processes. We believe this market structure underscores the importance of scale and industry relationships and the need for broad, diverse coverage across states, districts and schools. Even while we believe certain initiatives in the education sector, such as the Common Core State Standards, a set of shared math and literacy standards benchmarked to international standards, have increased standardization in K-12 education content, we believe significant state standard specific customization still exists, and we believe the need to address customization provides an ongoing need for companies in the sector to maintain relationships with individual state and district policymakers and expertise in state-varying academic standards.
According to FutureSource Consulting Ltd., the U.S. display market is expected to reach $37 billion in 2022 and increase to $49 billion in 2026 while the global display market is forecast to approximate $10.5 trillion in 2022 while holding constant at approximately $9.8 trillion for 2023 through 2026. While the education sector has historically represented the majority of displays sold, growth in the corporate sector continue to outpace the education sector with sales to the corporate sector expected to reach approximately 47% of the global display market in 2026. The growth in both the education and corporate sectors provides the Company with significant growth opportunities. In addition, the display market is highly fragmented allowing the Company to position itself for increased market share in each of these sectors.
According to “All Global Market Education & Learning,” an industry publication, the market for hardware products is growing due to increases in the use of interactive whiteboards and simulation-based learning hardware. Educational institutions have become more receptive to the implementation of high-tech learning tools. The advent of technology in the classroom has enabled multi-modal training and varying curricula. In general, technology-based tools help develop student performance when integrated with the curriculum. The constant progression of technology in education has helped educators create classroom experiences that are interactive, developed and collaborative.
Our Opportunity
We believe that our Connected Classroom™ solution uniquely positions Boxlight to be the leading provider of EdTech products within our categories in the global education technology market. Our holistic solution of hardware, software, content and professional development improves learning progression by increasing student engagement and timely interventions. Coupled with our innovations, we have a strong brand, operations and supply-chain; our channel into the US and EMEA remains strong and the global market is growing year-on-year; with our global 24/7 technical and customer services team which retains a high satisfaction rating.
Globally it is widely acknowledged that long-term economic growth is closely correlated to investment in education and educational technology, thus sustaining long-term growth in the market, even during periods of economic downturn. Further details of our solution and favorable macro-economic analysis are set forth below:
Growth in U.S. K-12 Market Expenditures
Significant resources are being devoted to primary and secondary education, both in the United States and abroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers report, U.S. education expenditure has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion (~6% of U.S. GDP), with K-12 education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is roughly triple U.S. spending for K-12 education.
The market for K-12 services and technology has historically grown above the pace of inflation, averaging 7.2% growth annually since 1969. Deviations around this mean occur during periods of economic growth and recession causing peaks and troughs in the K-12 market, albeit below other sectors.

7



HolonIQ reported in the Global EdTech Venture Capital Report that there has been some $32 billion in venture capital investment in the education/technology sector in the last decade (approximately 33% within the US) and predicts nearly triple that investment through to 2030. Further, the Report estimates that the global “expenditure on education and training from governments, parents, individuals and corporates continues to grow to historic levels and is expected to reach USD $10 trillion by 2030.”
Increasing Focus on Accountability and the Quality of Student Education
U.S. K-12 education has come under significant political scrutiny in recent years, with findings that American students rank far behind other global leaders in international tests of literacy, math and science, with the resulting conclusion that the current state of U.S. education severely impairs the United States’ economic, military and diplomatic security as well as broader components of America’s global leadership. We believe this scrutiny will cause there to be increased investment into the education sector. 
Trends in Tech-Savvy Education
While industries from manufacturing to health care have adopted technology to improve their results, according to Stanford Business School in its Trends in Tech-Savvy Education, the education field remains heavily reliant on “chalk and talk” instruction conducted in traditional settings; however, that is changing as schools and colleges adopt virtual classrooms, data analysis, online games, highly customized coursework, and other cutting-edge tools to help students learn.
New Technologies
The delivery of digital education content is also driving a substantial shift in the education market. In addition to interactive flat panels, other technologies are being adapted for educational uses on the Internet, mobile devices and through cloud-computing, which permits the sharing of digital files and programs among multiple computers or other devices at the same time through a virtual network. We intend to be a leader in the development and implementation of these additional technologies to create effective digital learning environments.
Growth in the E-learning Market
According to the “E-learning Market – Global Outlook and Forecast 2020-2025,” the e-learning market is expected to display significant growth opportunities in the next five years. While the growth curve is uniform in terms of the number of users, the same is not the case by revenues; the average cost of content creation and delivery with the same is undergoing a consistent decline. However, the advent of cloud infrastructure, peer-to-peer problem solving, open content creation, and rapid expansion of the target audience has enabled e-learning providers to rein in economies of choice and offer course content at a competitive price. While the growth prospects of the e-learning market remain stable, the rise of efficient sub-segments is changing the learning and training landscape gradually.
Vendors are also focusing on offering choices on the course content at competitive prices to gain the share in the global e-learning market. The exponential growth in the number of smartphone users and internet connectivity across emerging markets is driving the e-learning market in these regions. The introduction of cloud-based learning and Augmented/Virtual reality mobile-based learning is likely to revolutionize the e-learning market during the forecast period.
Major vendors are introducing technology-enabled tools that can facilitate user engagement, motivate learners, and help in collaborations, thereby increasing the market share and attracting new consumers to the market. The growing popularity of blended learning that enhances the efficiency of learners will drive the growth of the e-learning market. The e-learning market is expected to generate revenue of $65.41 billion by 2023, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.07% during the forecast period.

Educational Software Category
The Mimio suite of software and applications is a combination of titles from acquisitions of Mimio, Qwizdom, and Sahara (Clevertouch) - leading brands in the IWB and Formative Assessment Software Categories, and since then capabilities have been built upon that IP. The premise of our software is to provide the “glue” that integrates the hardware to provide a Connected Classroom; help educators inform their decisions in the classroom, through more systematic data about their students’ performance and behaviors; make learning more engaging, interactive, accessible, and innovative; and support teachers in becoming more efficient in planning, preparation, reporting and analysis, and effective in instruction and assessment.
MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software
MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities. These lessons and activities can be presented and managed from the front of the classroom using any of Boxlight’s front-of-classroom display systems including MimioTeach, ProColor Interactive LED panels, MimioPro 4, and MimioFrame. MimioStudio can also be operated using a mobile device such as an iPad or tablet that fully replicates the front-of-classroom display generated by MimioStudio. Operation with a mobile device is enabled via the three-user license for MimioMobile, provided with the MimioStudio license that accompanies all front-of-classroom devices from Mimio.
MimioMobile Collaboration and Assessment Application
The introduction of MimioMobile, a software accessory for MimioStudio, in 2014 introduced a new era of fully interactive student activities that are directly and immediately able to be displayed on the front-of-classroom interactive displays through MimioStudio.

MimioMobile allows fully interactive activities to be pushed to student classroom devices. The students can manipulate objects within the activities, annotate “on top” of them, and even create completely new content on their own handheld devices. MimioMobile also enables assessment using mobile devices. The teacher can create multiple choice, true\false, yes\no, and text entry assessment questions. The students can respond at their own pace and their answers are stored within MimioStudio from which the teacher can display graphs showing student results. This “continuous assessment” provides formative assessment that can help guide the teacher as to whether to re-teach the material if understanding is low or move forward in the lesson. We believe that this interactive and student dependent instructional model can dramatically enhance student outcomes.

Integration Strategy
We plan to centralize our business management for all acquisitions through an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system which offers streamlined subsidiary integration utilizing a multi-currency platform. We have strengthened and refined the process to drive front-line sales forecasting to factory production. Through the ERP system, we have synchronized five separate accounting and customer relationship management systems through a cloud-based interface to improve inter-company information sharing and allow management of the Company to have immediate access to snapshots of the performance of each of our subsidiaries in a common currency. As we grow, organically or through acquisition, we plan to quickly integrate each subsidiary or division into the Company to allow for clearer and earlier visibility of performance to enable for timely and effective business decisions.
Logistics (Suppliers)
Logistics is currently provided in the US by our Lawrenceville, Georgia facility and internationally by the Sahara team in London. Together these teams manage multiple third-party logistics partners throughout the world (3PL’s). These 3PL partners allow Boxlight to provide affordable freight routes and shorter delivery times to our customers by providing on-hand inventory in localized markets. Contract manufacturing for Boxlight products is through original design manufacturer (ODM) and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners according to Boxlight’s specific engineering specifications and utilizing IP developed and owned by Boxlight. Boxlight’s factories for ODM and OEM are located in the USA, Taiwan, China and Germany.
Technical Support and Service
The Company currently has its core technical support and service centers located near Atlanta, GA, London, England, and Belfast, Northern Ireland. Additionally, the Company’s technical support division is responsible for the repair and management of customer service cases, resulting in more than 60% of the Company’s customer service calls ending in immediate closure of the 

15



applicable service case. We accomplish this as a result of the familiarity between our products and having specialized customer service technicians hired internally and with key partners in certain international markets.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales force consists of 53 account managers in EMEA including an EMEA sales director, 43 regional account managers in the US including our Vice President Sales US, four sales heads based in Canada, one in Latin America and one in Australia. Our marketing team consists of our Vice President of Marketing Communications, a marketing coordinator, an education specialist, and a graphic designer. Our sales force and marketing teams primarily drive sales of all Boxlight products (including our Mimio, Clevertouch, FrontRow and EOS brands) throughout North, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In addition, we go to market through an indirect channel distribution model and utilize traditional value-added resellers and support them with training to become knowledgeable about the products we sell. We currently have approximately 800 resellers.
We believe we offer the most comprehensive product portfolio in today’s education technology industry, along with best-in-class service and technical support. Our award-winning, interactive classroom technology and easy to use line of classroom hardware and software solutions provide schools and districts with the most complete line of progressive, integrated classroom technologies available worldwide.
We are also developing our Corporate, Higher Education and Government solutions and have separate sales teams in both the US and EMEA focused on these areas. Our expectation is that over time opportunity in these areas will expand to be as large or potentially larger than our K-12 Education business.
Competition
The interactive education industry is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of interactive flat panels and interactive whiteboards. Interactive displays, since the time they were first introduced, have evolved from a high-cost technology that involves multiple components requiring professional installers, to a one-piece technology that is available at increasingly reduced-price points and affords simple installations. With lowered technology entry barriers, we face heated competition from other interactive display developers, manufacturers and distributors. We compete with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive displays and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens and smart phones, such as Smart Technologies, Promethean, ViewSonic, Dell Computers, Samsung, Panasonic and ClearTouch.
Even with these competitors, the market presents new opportunities in responding to demands to replace outdated and failing interactive displays with more affordable and simpler solution interactive displays. Our ability to integrate our technologies and remain innovative and develop new technologies desired by our current and potential new contract manufacturing customers will determine our ability to grow our contract manufacturing divisions. In addition, we have begun to see expansion in the market to sales of complementary products that work in conjunction with the interactive technology, including software, audio solutions, data capture and tablets.

Recent Financing
On December 31, 2021, the Company and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Boxlight, FrontRow, and Sahara as guarantors, entered into a maximum four-year $68.5 million term loan credit facility, dated December 31, 2021 (the “Credit Agreement”), with WhiteHawk Finance LLC, as lender (the “Lender”), and WhiteHawk Capital Partners, LP, as collateral agent (“the Collateral Agent”). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company received an initial term loan of $58.5 million on December 31, 2021 (the “Initial Loan”) and obtained a delayed draw facility of up to $10 million (the “Delayed Draw”). The Initial Loan and the Delayed Draw are collectively referred to as the Term Loans. The “Term Loans” bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus 10.75%; provided that after June 30, 2022, if the Company’s Senior Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than 2.25, the interest rate would be reduced to LIBOR plus 10.25%. Such terms are subject to the Company maintaining a borrowing base in terms compliant with the Credit Agreement.
The proceeds of the Initial Loan were used to finance the Company’s acquisition of FrontRow, and pay off all indebtedness owed to our then lenders. The terms of the Credit Agreement and related loans are described in more detail in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.” Of the Initial Loan, $8.5 million, was subject to repayment on February 28, 2022, with quarterly principal payments of $625,000 and interest payments commencing March 31, 2022 and the $40.0 million remaining balance plus any Delayed Draw loans becoming due and payable in full on December 31, 2025. 
​
In conjunction with its receipt of the Initial Loan, the Company issued to the Lender (i) 528,169 shares of Class A common stock (the “Shares”), which Shares were registered pursuant to our existing shelf registration statement and were delivered to the Lender in January 2022, (ii) a warrant to purchase 2,043,291 shares of Class A common stock (subject to increase to the extent of 3% of any Series B and Series C convertible preferred stock converted into Class A common stock), exercisable at $2.00 per share (the “Warrant”), which Warrant may be subject to repricing on March 31, 2022 based on the arithmetic volume weighted average prices for the 30 trading days prior to March 31, 2022, in the event our stock is then trading below $2.00 per share, (iii) a 3% fee of $1,800,000 and (iv) a $500,000 original issue discount. In addition, the Company agreed to register for resale the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant. The Company also incurred agency fees, legal fees and other costs in connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement. Based on the arithmetic volume weighted average prices of the Company’s Class A common stock for the 30 trading days prior to March 31, 2022, the exercise price of the Warrant was reduced to $1.19 per share and the shares increased to 3,434,103. On July 22, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited institutional investor. According to the terms of the WhiteHawk agreement, this purchase agreement triggered a reduction of the exercise price of the warrants. The warrants were repriced to $1.10 and shares increased to 3,715,075.
On March 29, 2022, the Company received a notice from the collateral agent, alleging, among other things, defaults as a result of (i) failure to repay $8.5 million of the facility by February 28, 2022, (ii) non-compliance with the borrowing base resulting in the Company being in an over advance position under the Credit Agreement, and (iii) failure to timely provide certain reports and documents. As a result, all accrued and unpaid interest owed under the Term Loan, became subject to a post-default interest rate equal to the highest interest rate allowed for under the Credit Agreement plus 2.50% until such time as the events of default were either waived or cured.
​
In February 2022, WhiteHawk and the Company agreed in principle to an extension of the February 2022 Payment. Pursuant to amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated April 4, 2022, the Collateral Agent and Lender agreed to extend the terms of repayment of the $8.5 million originally due on February 28, 2022 until February 28, 2023 and waive and/or otherwise extend compliance with certain other terms of the Credit Agreement in order to allow the Loan Parties adequate time to comply with such terms. In July 2022, the Company and WhiteHawk agreed that the notice had inadvertently included the default with respect to the failure to repay $8.5 million of the facility. As a result, notwithstanding the notice, both WhiteHawk and the Company have agreed that the Company was not in default in making the February 2022 Payment to WhiteHawk.
​
The principal elements of the April amendment included (a) an extension of time to repay $8.5 million of the principal amount of the term loan from February 28, 2022 to February 28, 2023, and (b) forbearance on $3,500,000 in over advances until May 16, 2022 to allow the Company to come into compliance with the borrowing base requirements set forth in the Credit Agreement. In such connection, the Loan Parties have obtained credit insurance on certain key customers whose principal offices are located in the European Union and Australia as, without the credit insurance, their accounts owed to the Loan Parties had been deemed ineligible for inclusion in the borrowing base calculation primarily due to the perceived inability of the Collateral Agent to enforce security interests on such 

17



accounts. In addition, the Lender and Collateral Agent agreed to (i) reduce, through September 30, 2022, the minimum cash reserve requirement for the Loan Parties, (ii) reduce the interest rate by 50 basis points (to LIBOR plus 9.75%) after delivery of the Loan Parties’ September 30, 2023 financial statements, subject to the Loan Parties maintaining 1.75 EBITDA coverage ratio, and (iii) waive all prior Events of Default under the Credit Agreement. In conjunction with the amendment to the Credit Agreement, the parties entered into an amended and restated fee letter (the “Fee Letter”) pursuant to which the parties agreed to prepayment premiums of (i) 5% for payments made on or before December 31, 2022, (ii) 4% for payments made between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, and (iii) 2% for payments made between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2025. Furthermore, the parties agreed that no prepayment premiums would be payable with respect to the first $5.0 million paid under the Term Loan, any payments made in relation to the $8.5 million due on or before February 28, 2023, any required amortization payments under the Credit Agreement and any mandatory prepayments by way of ECF or casualty events.
​
On June 21, 2022, the Company and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (together with the Company, the “Loan Parties”), entered into a second amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the four-year term loan credit facility, originally entered into December 31, 2021 and as amended on April 4, 2022, with the Collateral Agent and Lender. The Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement was entered into for purposes of the Lender funding a $2.5 million delayed draw term loan and adjusting certain terms to the Credit Agreement, including adjusting the Applicable Margin (as defined in the Second Amendment) to 13.25% for LIBOR Rate Loans and 12.25% for Reference Rate Loans, increasing the definition of change of control from 33% voting power to 40% voting power, requiring the Company to engage a financial advisor, and allowing additional time, until July 15, 2022, for the Company to come into compliance with certain borrowing base requirements set forth in the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, among other adjustments.
