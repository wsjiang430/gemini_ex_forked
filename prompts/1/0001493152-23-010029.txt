Our Business Model
 
We believe that the direct-selling channel is ideally suited to marketing our products, because sales of health solution and personal care products are strengthened by ongoing personal contact between retail consumers and distributors. This personal contact may enhance consumers’ nutritional and health education and motivate consumers to begin and maintain wellness and weight management programs. In addition, by using our products themselves, distributors can provide first-hand testimonials of product effectiveness, which can serve as a powerful sales tool.
 
We are focused on building and maintaining our distributor network by offering financially rewarding and flexible career opportunities through the sale of quality, innovative products to health-conscious consumers. We believe the income opportunity provided by our bonus program appeals to a broad cross-section of our members, particularly those seeking to supplement family income, start a home business or pursue entrepreneurial, full and part-time, employment opportunities. Our distributors, who are all independent third parties, profit from selling our products and also earning bonuses through performance of their network group, the establishment of their own network group and the performance of distributors recruited under their own network group. Top performing distributors with their own physical stores may also become stockists of the company, whereby they enjoy benefits such as maintaining a certain amount of the Company’s inventory in their store premises, with the requirement that all product sales are monitored through our centralized stock tracking system and accounted back to us. The stockists have the option of returning or exchanging any unsold inventory consigned to them.
 
We enable distributors to maximize their potential by providing a broad array of motivational, educational and support services. We motivate our distributors through our performance-based compensation plan, product-training seminars, workshops and participation in routine promotional activities.
 
We are committed to providing professionally designed educational training materials that our distributors can use to enhance recruitment and to maximize their sales. We conduct several training sessions per year to motivate our distributors. These training events teach our distributors not only how to develop invaluable business-building and leadership skills, but also how to differentiate our products with their consumers, including information sessions presented by in-house nutritional consultants.
 
Our corporate-sponsored training events provide a forum for distributors, who otherwise operate independently, to share ideas with us and each other. In addition, we are also developing an e-marketing and e-trading platform allowing for marketing and trading of products to members, as well as online recruitment of new members and to provide direct sales to customers.
 
We are committed to providing our distributors with quality products to help them increase sales and recruit additional distributors. We leverage our team of in-house nutritional consultants with rich experience gained in the area of nutrition, in collaborating with our customers and clients to understand the health and wellness market via a process of consultative review. This review team is headed by the Head of Product Development. We then communicate our findings and proposals to third-party suppliers to improve formulations, to bring about new products for distributors and members who are ready to market to end-users.
 
We place a strong emphasis on the science of nutrition. We have obtained the appropriate authorizations from the Food Safety and Quality Division, and the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency of the Ministry of Health, Malaysia for all our products. Whenever products are purchased for inventory replenishment, samples are randomly selected from every batch for testing at laboratories registered with the Ministry of Health Malaysia.

Our customers are able to become lifetime members by paying a one-time membership fee with the purchase of specific products. Doing so allows the customer to enjoy membership discounts on all our products.
 
Members who accumulate a predetermined number of purchases are automatically promoted to become a distributor of the Company. Other than helping distributors achieve physical health and wellness through the use of our products, we offer our distributors, who are independent third parties, bonuses based on various performance factors. Distributors are required to maintain a predetermined number of purchases per year in order to maintain their distributor status.
 
Top performing distributors with their own physical stores may also become stockists of the Company, whereby they enjoy benefits such as maintaining a certain amount of the Company’s inventory in their store premises.

Distributors’ and members’ earnings

Members are encouraged to build their respective network group. Members are promoted to distributors if they manage to recruit the requisite number of members; and the network group is able to achieve set sales targets.

Distributors and members motivation and training
 
We believe that motivation, inspiration and training are key elements in the success of sales via network group marketing. Together with our distributors and members, we have established a consistent schedule of gatherings to support those needs. We conduct several training sessions per year to educate and motivate our distributors and members. The training sessions are typically presented by in-house staff with suitable background in nutrition, in order to provide key nutrition information about our products, as well as providing workshops to promote presentation skills to attending participants.
 
Our Suppliers
 
Currently, all of our products are acquired from unrelated third parties located in Australia, the United States, Germany and Malaysia, and rebranded by us. Due to the high costs associated with research and development of nutrition and health products, we do not maintain any facilities to produce our products. We have no expenditures or expenses relating to research and development of our product. We leverage our team of in-house nutritional consultants with rich experience gained in the area of nutritionist work, in collaborating with our customers and clients to understand the health and wellness market via a process of consultative review. We then communicate our findings and proposals to third-party suppliers to improve formulations and to bring about new products for distributors and members who are ready to market to end-users.

Insurance
 
The Employees’ Social Security Act, 1969, Malaysia mandates employers and employees to make a monthly contribution to the Social Security Organisation, Malaysia, (“SOCSO”) for any employee who is employed for wages paid under a contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer for the purpose of providing social security protection to employees and their dependents against occupational injuries, including industrial accident, accident during emergency at the employers’ premises, occupational diseases and commuting accidents. Depending on the monthly wages earned by the employee, employers shall cause to be deducted from the respective employee’s wages, amounts that ranges between RM0.10 to RM19.75 for monthly wages between RM30 to RM4,000. The employers’ contribution corresponds to the said rates are between RM0.4 to RM69.05. Rates applicable to both the employee and employer are fixed at the maximum rate of RM19.75 and RM69.05 respectively. Employees who have attained 60 years of age are not required to contribute to the scheme. The employer’s responsibility towards this group shall be at a reduced rate which ranges between MYR0.30 to RM49.40 for the said wage band.
 
Other than SOCSO, effective January 1, 2018, employees and employers in the private sector are mandated to contribute to an employment insurance system, (“EIS”) under the Employment Insurance System Act, 2017. Both the employee and employer shall contribute at an equal rate at 0.2% of the employee’s wages under the scheme, subject to a maximum monthly wage rate of RM4,000. No further contribution to the scheme is required from the employee or the employer for employees who have attained 60 years of age; and employees aged 57 and above who have no prior contributions are exempted.
 
We do not have any third-party liability insurance to cover claims in respect of personal injury or property or environmental damage arising from accidents on our property or relating to our operations. Such insurance is not mandatory according to the laws and regulations of Malaysia. We typically do not require our distributors to purchase insurance regarding their operations. We believe this practice is consistent with customary industry standards.
