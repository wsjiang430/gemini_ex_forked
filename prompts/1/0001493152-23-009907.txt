Corporate History
 
General
 
AppYea, Inc. (“AppYea”, “the Company”, “we” or “us”) was incorporated in the State of South Dakota on November 26, 2012 to engage in the acquisition, purchase, maintenance and creation of mobile software applications. The Company is in the development stage with no significant revenues and no operating history. On November 1, 2021 the Company was redomiciled in the State of Nevada.
 
On August 2, 2021, AppYea entered into a stock exchange agreement with SleepX Ltd., a company formed under the laws of the State of Israel (“SleepX”) and controlled by the majority shareholder of AppYea, our chief executive officer Barry Molchadsky. Pursuant to the agreement, the outstanding equity capital consisting of 1,724 common shares of SleepX was exchanged for 174,595,634 shares of common stock of the Company, based on the agreement that determined that to SleepX shareholders will be issued common shares in the amount that will result in them holding 80% of the common shares issued of AppYea. The agreement was subject to certain terms before the agreement could be closed. On December 31, 2021, the agreement was consummated as the terms of the agreement were fulfilled; As a result, SleepX became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The issuance of the shares to SleepX shareholders, due to administrative matters was completed in March 2022 after the Company completed a reverse stock split.
 
In anticipation of the reverse merger described below, on July 2, 2021, Boris Molchadsky a majority shareholder of the Company, acquired in a private transaction from the former majority shareholder two hundred and twenty-five thousand (225,000) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company. The Series A Preferred Shares have the right to vote 1,000 to 1 as shares of common stock and are convertible into 1,500 to 1 of the shares of common stock of the Company. The acquisition of the Preferred Shares provides Boris Molchadsky control of a majority of the Company’s voting equity capital.
 
Business Overview
 
AppYea, Inc. is a digital health company, focused on the development of accurate wearable monitoring solutions to treat sleep apnea and snoring and fundamentally improve quality of life.
 
Our solutions are based on our proprietary intellectual property portfolio comprised of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensing technologies for the tracking, analysis, and diagnosis of vital signs and other physical parameters during sleep time, offering extreme accuracy at affordable cost.
 
AI is a broad term generally used to describe conditions where a machine mimics “cognitive” functions associated with human intelligence, such as “learning” and “problem solving. Basic AI includes machine learning, where a machine uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about a given phenomenon. The machine is “trained” using large amounts of data and algorithms that provide it with the ability to learn how to perform the task.
 
General Background
 
Snoring is a general disorder caused due to repetitive collapsing and narrowing of the upper airway. Individuals with snoring problems are at increased risk of accidental injury, depression and anxiety, heart disease and stroke. Currently available treatments include surgical and non-surgical devices.
 
According to Fior Markets, a market intelligence company, the Global Anti-Snoring Treatment Market is expected to grow from USD 4.3 billion in 2020 to USD 8.6 billion by 2028, with a 9.07% CAGR between 2021 and 2028. While North America had the largest market share of 28.12% in 2020, Asia-Pacific region is witnessing significant growth due to the increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles in emerging economies.

Currently available anti-snoring devices consist mainly of oral appliances that are recommended for use by patients suffering of snoring or obstructive sleep apnea. These appliances are put before sleep and have a simple function of pushing either the lower jaw or the tongue forward. This keeps the epiglottis parted from the uvula and prevents the snoring sound created by the vibration of soft tissues of palate.
 
Sleep apnea is a severe sleep condition in which individuals frequently stop breathing in their sleeping, this leads to insufficient oxygen supply to the brain and the rest of the body which, in turn may lead to critical problems. There are three main types of apnea: (i) Obstructive Sleep Apnea (“OSA”), the most common form caused by the throat muscles relaxing during sleep; (ii) Central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain doesn’t send the proper signals to the muscles that control the breathing; and (iii) complex sleep apnea syndrome, which occurs when an individual suffers from both OSA and central sleep apnea. While OSA is a common disorder in the elderly population, affecting approximately 13 to 32% of people aged over 65, sleep apnea can occur at any age and affects approximately 25% of men and nearly 10% of women.
 
In 2020, North America dominated the sleep apnea device market, as it accounted for 49% of the revenue, the global market size was valued at USD 3.7 billion and is expected to expand by 6.2% CAGR, according to a report by Grand View Research Inc., reaching USD 6.1 billion by 2028.
 
The global sleep apnea and snoring market is driven in large part by solutions that can be applied in at home-settings or healthcare settings, as these tools will drive decisions regarding specific treatments and the associated outlays. However, despite advances in medical imaging and other diagnostic tools, misdiagnosis remains a common occurrence. We believe that improved diagnoses and outcomes are achievable through the adoption of AI-based decision support tools.
 
Our Products and Product Candidates
 
Our initial focus is on the development of supporting solutions utilizing our proprietary platform. Our current business plan focuses on two principal devices and an App currently in development:
 
DreamIT – Biofeedback snoring treatment wristband, combined with the SleepX App.
 
This wristband uses unique algorithms designed by SleepX combined with sensors to monitor physiological parameters during sleep. Based on real time reactions, the wristband will vibrate, when necessary, in order to decrease the snoring and regulate breathing by gently bringing the user to a lighter sleep and thus ceasing the snoring event.
 
The DreamIT product is currently in testing and calibration stage in preparation for serial manufacturing.
 
DreamIT PRO – is a wristband for the treatment of sleep apnea using biofeedback in combination with SleepX PRO app. The unique algorithms of SleepX PRO, combined with the wristband sensors, monitor sleep apnea events and additional physiological parameters during sleep, and when necessary, the wristband vibrates according to real time events, in order to decrease and cease sleep apnea events.
 
The DreamIT PRO product is currently in advanced development stages, following which it would be ready to begin the testing stage in preparation for filing for FDA approval.
 
SleepX PRO – Is a medical application, available for downloading on a smartphone, and used to monitor breathing patterns in the sleep and identify sleep apnea episodes without direct contact to the user.
 
The SleepX PRO product is to begin final calibration, following which we will file for 510(k) FDA approval.

Our Strategy
 
We plan to debut the marketing of the SleepX app and the first DreamIT product in the second quarter of 2023. Concurrently, we plan to file a 510(k) FDA request for the SleepX PRO app for the non-contact diagnosis of sleep apnea and during 2024 an FDA process for DreamIT PRO for the treatment of sleep apnea.
 
Our goal over the next five years is to establish our technology and related products as the gold standard for the targeted sectors. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 
Develop and expand a balanced and diverse pipeline of products and product candidates. Our core platform technologies will include innovative anti-snoring and sleep apnea related devices and product candidates in various development and clinical stages. We plan to add products and product candidates to our pipeline by expanding our technologies being developed to additional indications and through investing in new technologies, products and product candidates. By maintaining this multi-product approach, we aim to provide a broad and comprehensive product offering, which we believe will result in multiple value inflection events, reduced risks to our potentially business associated with a particular product or product candidate and increased return on investment. Furthermore, product candidates that we develop may create attractive collaboration opportunities with diagnostics, medical devices and medical supplies companies.
 
Maintain a global, diverse network of specialists to accelerate knowledge synergies and innovation. We will utilize a global network of specialists to identify large and growing patient populations with significant unmet needs, evaluate and prioritize potential technologies, assist in designing development plans and diagnostic protocols and determine potential indications of our platform technologies to our target patient populations in various territories. We believe that maintaining this diverse network of specialists and industry specialists will allow us to continue to maximize knowledge and cost synergies, utilize shared commercial infrastructure across products, reduce risks of development and commercialization delays to our overall business and leverage our current and future platform technologies and technologies for additional products and product candidates.
 
Establish distribution channels to maximize the commercial potential of our products. We plan to seek out collaborative arrangement with major healthcare providers and consumer specialists to facilitate market adoption of our product candidates. We believe that such institutions are well positioned to directly benefit from improvements in accurate diagnosis and reduction of cost of care associated with the use of our product candidates. We also believe that the marginal cost of our product candidates compared to potential savings will make it economical for healthcare institutions to adopt our products regardless of whether or not additional costs of purchase of these products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs and commercial insurance companies. Through cooperation with healthcare providers, we aim to develop and prove an economic model beneficial to them. In parallel, we intend selling directly, through our website and other online webstores worldwide. Thereafter, we plan to engage with private insurance plans to develop reimbursement programs encouraging the use of our product candidates. We expect that adoption rates of our product candidates will increase if hospitals and other medical institutions are compensated, in full or in part, for additional costs incurred when purchasing our products.
 
We intend to establish a logistical distribution facility in the US and Israel.

Market size of those suffering from snoring and sleep apnea on the one hand and attractive price to the consumer on the other hand are expected to allow the company to gain a large number of users through online marketing. We plan to continue developing big data-based algorithms for predicting life-threatening illnesses and health events and to warn ahead of time.
 
In addition to self-development, we are examining acquisitions of technologies and synergistic companies to enable our customers a holistic solution for quality and healthy sleep.
 
Competition
 
The snoring treatment market is characterized by a large number of players that with solutions concentrated around the nose and mouth such as: Plastic cones inserted into the nose and assembled in the nostrils; Silicone mold that is inserted into the mouth to push the lower jaw forward; strap tied around the head and jaw in order to keep the mouth closed. One of the most common treatments is tying a tennis ball to the back in order to make a habit of not sleeping on the back. These treatments are both inconvenient and ineffective for most people, resulting in the user giving up and discarding the treatment after a short period.
 
In addition, there are a number of apps for monitoring snoring using a microphone but none of them are for treatment. It is important to note that the use of the microphone for breathing monitoring is protected by patents belonging to the company and it intends after the raise to act legally to enforce them.

Sleep Apnea market is divided into two segments:
 
(i) Identification and characterization: In most cases, this procedure takes place overnight in a sleep laboratory, following a doctor’s referral. An inconvenient process that requires the subject to sleep outside his house while connected to many sensors. One of the setbacks of sleeping in a sleep laboratory is that it’s different from the sleeping conditions at home and therefore will not accurately reflect the problem and potentially affect the diagnoses. Furthermore, it is very expensive to conduct such an evaluation, as it requires overnight hospitalization.
 
It is possible to perform the sleep test at home by renting the required equipment for the procedure. Most devices used in home testing measure saturation during the night, by using a clip monitor placed on the index finger and connecting to additional devices. The test is expensive, uncomfortable, and less accurate. The SleepX Pro app was designed to overcome such inconveniences, it is installed on a smartphone and can perform a test every night, accurately, without patient contact, while being convenient, effective, precise, and cheap.
 
(ii) Treatment of sleep apnea: After characterization and identification of the disorder, the most common solution accepted today is CPAP – a Face mask attached with a tube to a compressor which during the night pressurizing air into the patient’s lungs in order to open air passages and prevent them from being blocked. Most people can’t adapt to the solution due to discomfort - Interfering with changing sleep position, pressing the area of the face. Only severe cases, where the patient is at high risk, they continue to use the device. The company’s solution, that instead of pressurizing the blockage, teaches the patient to sleep in a correct position, where the block is not created.
 
We operate in highly competitive segments of the Health Tech markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial medical device enterprises, academic institutions, government agency, and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large Health Tech companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
We expect our principal competitors to be the Philips SmartSleep Snoring Relief band, which is intended to reduce snoring by prompting the user to sleep on his side rather than on the back, with a positional monitor that detects when the user is turning and delivers gentle vibration that prompt the user to sleep on his side. Another competitor is Fitbit, which offers sleep tracking on its devices since 2017, by measuring the users heart rate and movement to provide them with a breakdown of their sleep cycles. In addition to this, in May 2021, Fitbit confirmed that a new feature called Snore & Noise Detect was added to analyse noise levels and determine whether the user is snoring. Amazon’s Alexa is expected to soon allow for the detection of sleep apnea.
 
Manufacturing
 
Currently, we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. While we plan to depend on third party contract manufacturers for device manufacturing, we plan to perform the final assembly, quality control and release of finished goods in our facilities. The components of the wristband are considered off the shelf products with minor adaptive software specifications and design, which makes us independent of one manufacturer. We intend to purchase the wrist band on the shelf components from third party manufacturers and do the assembly, molding, and distribution in a facility in Israel. Ultimately, we intend to bring the whole production line to a local manufacturer in Israel.
 
We currently manufacture our bracelets in an OEM factory in China, with a monthly manufacturing capacity of 48,000 units. We plan on procuring enough units to suffice for three months of orders at all times, in such we minimize our exposure to supply chain disruptions. By holding enough stock in our warehouses to supply orders for three months our management believes that such supply would mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions, should these occur. Furthermore, our products don’t contain any special materials which would have an effect on the ability of our supplier to manufacture the product.

Manufacturers of our products are required among other things, to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s Quality System Regulation. The QSR requires manufacturing quality assurance and quality control as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation.
 
The algorithm and application programming is done in Israel by the Company service providers and employees.
 
Distribution and Revenue Generation
 
In the first stage, the company will market its products to the final consumer through the company’s website via the acquisition of media (investment in online marketing). The company has reviewed and made necessary adjustments for efficient marketing through social networks – Facebook, Instagram, and Google. In the European market the company Conducts negotiations with distributors and pharmacy chain stores. Since the company’s products are based on a smartphone app marketing will also be made through the Apple and Google App Stores.
 
For the DreamIT wristband, our strategy is to establish relationships with third parties (such as well-established sales organizations, distributors, pharmacies, chain stores and marketing coordinators) that will assist us in developing, marketing, selling and implementing our products. In parallel, we intend selling directly, through our website and other online webstores worldwide.
 
We believe that strategic and technology-based relationships with medical facilities are fundamental to our success. We have forged numerous relationships with medical device distributors to enhance our combined capabilities. This approach enhances our ability to accelerate market penetration, accelerate the pace of our sales growth and solidify relationships.
 
We have a variety of marketing programs designed to create brand awareness and market recognition for our product offerings and for sales lead generation. Our marketing efforts include attending and presenting at healthcare related conferences, advertising, content development and distribution, public relations, social media publication of technical and informative articles in industry journals and sales training.
 
In addition, our strategic partners would augment our marketing and sales campaigns through seminars, trade shows and joint public relations and advertising campaigns. Our customers and strategic partners provide references and recommendations that we often feature in external marketing activities.
 
For the PRO devices, our strategy, in addition to the above-mentioned channels, is to market through healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors, HMO’s, insurance companies, cardiologists, hospitals, and sleep laboratories.
 
Facilities
 
Currently, the Company uses third party service providers facilities for manufacturing, assembly and distribution of company products. We intend to open logistic distribution centers in Israel and in the US. The Company shall rent office spaces for her operations in Israel and the US.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labelling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
Government Regulations.
 
Before we can market SleepX PRO and DreamIT PRO to the public in the US, we believe they will need to obtain clearance for commercial sale. Our devices, except for the DreamIT wristband, will be subject to ongoing regulation by the FDA in the US and other federal, state, and local regulatory bodies.

12
--


FDA regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, manufacturing, labelling, pre-clinical and clinical trials, post-market adverse event reporting, post-market surveillance, complaint handling, repair or recall of products, product storage, record keeping, pre-market clearance, advertising and promotion, and sales and distribution.
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device, such as our SleepX APP PRO and DreamIT PRO that is intended to be commercially distributed in the United States requires 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Based on the FDA guidance documents that we have reviewed, we expect to be subject to the shorter and more streamlined 510(k) process for SleepX APP PRO, which typically involves less risk of uncertainty, and the submission of less supporting documentation, and without the costly clinical trials; though of course no prior guarantee can be provided as to such regulatory treatment. Generally, gaining 510(k) clearance for a product depends on demonstrating that the subject product is “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared 510(k) device.
 
For the DreamIT PRO, the clearance process may involve three material steps. First, we will engage the FDA in a pre-submission conference to ensure that we understand and meet the FDA’s requirements, expectations and standards with regard to approval of our product candidates. At this meeting, our team, including our FDA regulatory consultant, will receive FDA comments and guidance regarding our proposed submission during the pre-market notification period for 510(K) clearance (including any suggested modifications to the device description, indications for use or summary of supporting data contained in the notification). Then we will prepare our submission to the FDA accordingly.
 
The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but, if additional testing, verifications or other procedures (or even clinical trials) are required, can take significantly longer.
 
After a medical device receives 510(k) clearance by the FDA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a significant change in its intended use, requires to re-determine the regulatory path.
 
The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can, at its discretion, require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance is obtained.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions: untitled letters or warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusal of or delay in granting 510(k) clearance of new products or modified products or rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances. Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. See “Risk Factor – Government Regulation,” above.
 
The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance of our proposed devices for many reasons, including:
 

● | our inability to demonstrate that our product is safe and effective for its intended users; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our inability to demonstrate that our product is the “substantial equivalent” of a previously cleared device; 
● | the data from clinical studies that we undertake may be insufficient to support clearance; and 
● | failure of the manufacturing process or facilities we use to meet applicable requirements. 

 
In addition, the FDA may change its pre-market policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay clearance of our devices.
 
Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain regulatory compliance prior to marketing our devices could prevent us from generating revenue therefrom or achieving profitability.

Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some customers from using our proposed product and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our proposed devices. If the FDA requires us to go through a more rigorous examination for our proposed product than we currently expect, such as requiring additional testing further verification or other procedures, we may require substantial additional funding sooner than anticipated and/or our product could be severely delayed. Being subject to an extended period of scrutiny or being required to conduct expensive clinical trials would be particularly harmful to our business.
 
Ongoing Regulation by FDA.
 
Upon FDA clearance, we will seek to obtain in the U.S. a CPT code for purposes of reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid.
 
Placing the SleepX APP PRO and DreamIT PRO device on the market requires in addition:
 

● | Establishment, registration and device listing; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to advertising and promotional activities; 
● | Medical device reporting (MDR) regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
● | Corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
● | Labelling and Unique Device Identification (UDI) regulations; and 
● | Post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. (Refer to the section below) 

 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Although premarket clinical trials provide important information on a device’s safety and effectiveness, it is possible that new safety concerns will emerge once the device is on the market. As a result, the FDA continues to monitor device performance after a device has been approved. FDA officials conduct routine inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities across the United States. Manufactures may be informed of inspections in advance, or the inspections may be unannounced. Inspection may be routine or cause by a particular problem. The purpose of these inspections is to make sure developers are following good manufacturing practices. Furthermore, the FDA can shut down a manufacturing facility if required standards are not met.

Clinical Useability Studies
 
In addition to the above, we plan to conduct clinical useability studies in the U.S. or other countries on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for a particular indication. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board, or IRB. Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot assure that access to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary.
Reimbursement
 
Our current go-to-market strategy does not contemplate or rely upon governmental or third party payor reimbursement, to the snoring treatment device. Following FDA approval for the treatment and identification of sleep apnea, we may seek reimbursement for product candidates as a means to expand the adoption of products and broaden our customer base.
 
To the extent that we adopt a market strategy which is in whole or in part reliant on third party reimbursement, commercial sales of our future products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from such third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Each third-party payor may have its own policy regarding what products it will cover, the conditions under which it will cover such products, and how much it will pay for such products. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved devices. Further, healthcare policy and payment reform models and medical cost containment models are being considered and/or adopted in the United States and other countries. Legislative and/or administrative reforms to applicable reimbursement systems may significantly reduce reimbursement for the services in which our products are used or result in the denial of coverage for such services outright. As a result, third-party reimbursement adequate to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development may not be available for our products.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
 
Anti-Kickback Statutes in the United States
 
The U.S. federal anti-kickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and wilfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a U.S. federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that, if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under U.S. federal healthcare programs, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. federal healthcare programs. The reach of the federal anti-kickback statute was broadened by the ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The ACA further provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the U.S. False Claims Act or the Civil Monetary Penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

The U.S. federal anti-kickback statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the anti-kickback statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG or the U.S. Department of Justice.
 
Many states have adopted laws similar to the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute. Some of these state prohibitions are broader than the U.S. federal statute, and apply to the referral of patients and recommendations for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Government officials have focused certain enforcement efforts on marketing of healthcare items and services, among other activities, and have brought cases against individuals or entities with sales personnel who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing physician users in an attempt to procure their business.
 
U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 
HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information and which can impose civil or criminal liability for violations of its provisions.
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
International Regulation
 
The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for the EU MDR (Medical Device Regulation) with which manufacturers selling medical products in the European Union and the European Economic Area, or EEA, must comply. The European Union has adopted regulation of the design, manufacture, labelling, clinical studies, post-market clinical follow-up, post-market surveillance and vigilance for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant EU MDR will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable regulations and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the European Union and EEA, after being certified by a Notified Body. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
