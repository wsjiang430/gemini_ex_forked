Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

General
 
Blue Ocean Acquisition Corp is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
On December 7, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 16,500,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a “Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds of $165,000,000. Substantially concurrent with the closing of the IPO, we consummated a private placement (the “Private Placement”) with our sponsor and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P., a fund managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc (“Apollo”), of an aggregate of 8,235,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,235,000. On December 7, 2021, a total of $168,300,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Trust Account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 
On December 7, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) solely to cover over-allotments, which option was granted to them under the underwriting agreement for the IPO. The sale of these 2,475,000 Over-Allotment Option Units closed on December 9, 2021, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000. Substantially concurrent with the closing of the over-allotment option, we consummated a private placement (the “Additional Private Placement” and, together with the Private Placement, the “Private Placements”) with our sponsor of an additional 990,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $990,000. On December 9, 2021, a total of $25,245,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the Additional Private Placement were deposited into the Trust Account, resulting in a total deposit of $193,545,000 in the Trust Account since the Trust Account was established. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest and are available for a business combination, assuming no redemptions, after payment of up to $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination.
 
On January 21, 2022 we announced that, commencing January 24, 2022, holders of the 18,975,000 Units sold in our initial public offering may elect to separately trade Class A ordinary shares and the Warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated continued to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “BOCNU” and Class A ordinary shares and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW,” respectively.
 


  Table of Contents     Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations (less up to $100,000 interest to pay dissolution expenses), the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 7, 2023 (or by September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended), subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 7, 2023 (or by September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended), or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the “Investment Company Act) which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination that can create value for shareholders over time. We believe our experience and deep network of relationships will help us identify a significant number of appealing business combination opportunities and enable us to evaluate these opportunities. Our management team has significant experience in multiple business models, across geographies and markets. Moreover, we believe that our management team’s backgrounds will make us attractive, long-term partners to business combination targets and help the post-business combination company to thrive in the public markets.
 
Our approach to sourcing and evaluating investment opportunities will draw on our management team’s experience and what we consider to be best practices for value creation. We plan to leverage our management team’s extensive experience and expertise in a methodical process to identify best-in-class initial business combination targets.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
We intend to pursue opportunities with exceptional growth companies addressing large market opportunities in highly differentiated ways. We are not limited by geography-either by focusing only on the U.S. or developed markets or by exploring only large emerging markets. We draw on our management team’s decades of global experience in sourcing transactions, understanding and conducting due diligence on new breakthrough technologies and leadership teams in order to identify and then negotiate a corporate combination. Our management team has experience in a number of areas related to business information and data, new products, digital video and audio platforms, including podcasting, sports and gaming media, and events platforms. We intend to find a target company that defines, is capable of significant and sustained growth, and relies on a disruptive and highly defensible strategy.
Valuation: We intend to target companies whose enterprise value is between $750 million and $2.0 billion. Companies of this size offer the potential for significant long-term shareholder return.
 
High growth sectors: We intend to seek companies within the consumer Internet sector and adjacent industry segments, including, but not limited to, online marketplaces, education technology, advertising technology and direct-to-consumer e-Commerce businesses.
 
Differentiation and scale: We intend to seek to invest in a business with a clearly differentiated market strategy and a clear vision for how it will scale the business and deploy a capital infusion effectively to accelerate growth, maintain or improve margins and outlast competition.
 
Geography: We intend to seek opportunities globally, with a particular emphasis on large-population, high-growth emerging regions in Asia and the Americas, including the United States.
 


  Table of Contents     Large market opportunities: We intend to seek opportunities that have traction and the potential to scale significantly into leaders in their markets. The addressable size of the market has to justify not only the valuation at the time of our initial business combination but also leave considerable runway for future upside. We intend to prioritize companies that take a “winner takes most” or “first mover advantage” approach.
Growth: We intend to seek companies that are on a sustainable growth trajectory, benefiting from the tailwinds of global Internet adoption.
 
Management excellence: We intend to look for teams that are creative, ambitious, visionary and data-driven. A consistent record of growth, experience overcoming challenges, and strategic vision are essential attributes.
 
Operational maturity: We intend to seek companies which have the requisite compliance, financial controls and reporting processes in place and are ready for the regulatory requirements of a public entity.
 
Best-in-class technology: Proprietary technology, or skillful deployment of technology and data, is essential to long-term success. So, too, is early-to-market deployment: Speed is a competitive advantage in the use of technology and data.
 
Opportunistic Strategy: The ability to effect business transformation and achieve growth requires an adaptable, market-tested, data-driven decision-making process and an experienced team. Where a target company’s leadership may lack this experience, our team, including our board members and advisors, can bring great depth in adaptive leadership.
 
Benefit from being public: We intend to work with management and stakeholders who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate substantial growth. The benefits of transitioning from a private to a public entity may include broader access to debt and equity providers, liquidity for employees and potential acquisitions, and expanded branding in the marketplace.
 
These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.
 
We will have until 18 months from the closing of our IPO, or June 7, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination, with an automatic three-month extension if we have signed a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination within such 18-month period. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within such 18-month period, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months, or until September 7, 2023, to complete a business combination) without submitting such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of our memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon ten days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $1,897,500 ($0.10 per unit) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for such three-month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loan will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amount out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. If we do not complete our initial business combination, we will not repay such loan. Furthermore, the letter agreement with our initial shareholders and Apollo contains a provision pursuant to which our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loan out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete our initial business combination. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of the loans made by our sponsor, our officers and directors, or their affiliates to us prior to or in connection with our initial business combination (including any loan made to extend our time period for consummating our initial business combination) may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. We will issue a press release announcing the extension at least three days prior to the applicable deadline.
 


  Table of Contents     Acquisition Process
 
We intend to conduct thorough due diligence to determine a prospective target’s quality and intrinsic value. That would include reviewing financial statements, legal documents, patents and proprietary technology, and historical data. We intend to meet with members of management, consult with industry experts, clients and competitors, and seek information from analysts and others familiar with the prospective target company’s business and prospects.
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the target or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post- business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable.
 
In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 


  Table of Contents     If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our Trust Account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Further, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders and Apollo have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with the exception of Apollo and certain advisors to the Company party thereto, any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares held by them.
Limitations on Redemption
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, a greater net tangible asset or cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. Furthermore, although we will not redeem shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination, we do not have a maximum redemption threshold based on the percentage of shares sold in our initial public offering. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.
  Table of Contents     Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In the case of a general meeting, such election must be made, unless extended by us in our sole discretion, no later than two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval, while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons.
 
If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to tender offer rules; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e- 4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote
 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and, with the exception of Apollo and certain advisors to the Company, any public shares in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination by June 7, 2023 (or by September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity.
 


  Table of Contents     Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares (as defined below), without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the Units sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the Units sold in the IPO without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only until June 7, 2023 (or until September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distribution with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023, if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended)

  Table of Contents     Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to a traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than a typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.

We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we pay to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have four executive officers: Marcus Brauchli, our Chairman, Richard Leggett, our Chief Executive Officer, Matt Lasov, our Chief Financial Officer, and Sean Glodek, our Vice President. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
