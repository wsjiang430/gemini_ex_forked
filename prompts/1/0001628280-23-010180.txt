Item 1.    Business Overview
Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. ("we", "Aquestive", the "Company") is a pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to solve patients' problems with current standards of care and provide transformative products to improve their lives. We are developing pharmaceutical products that deliver complex molecules through alternative administrations to invasive and inconvenient standard of care therapies. Aquestive has five licensed commercialized products which are marketed by our licensees in the U.S. and around the world. We are the exclusive manufacturer of these licensed products. Aquestive also collaborates with pharmaceutical companies to bring new molecules to market using proprietary, best-in-class technologies, like PharmFilm®, and has proven drug development and commercialization capabilities. Aquestive is advancing a product pipeline for the treatment of severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The Company has also developed a product pipeline focused on treating diseases of the central nervous system, or CNS. Our production facilities are located in Portage, Indiana, and our corporate headquarters and primary research laboratory facilities are based in Warren, New Jersey.
We manufacture licensed products at our facilities and anticipate that our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient for commercial quantities of our products and product candidates currently in development. Our facilities have been inspected by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Australian Government Department of Health's Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA), and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and are subject to inspection by all applicable health agencies, including the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). Not all collaborative or licensed products of the Company that may be commercially launched in the future will necessarily be manufactured by us, such as the case with KYNMOBI®.
PharmFilm® – Our Oral Film Technology
We are presently the worldwide leader in oral film drug delivery and manufacturing, having historically supplied the substantial majority of the world’s oral films for prescription pharmaceutical use, and we have the capability to produce more than one billion commercial doses a year. We developed our PharmFilm® technology to provide meaningful clinical and therapeutic advantages over other existing dosage forms and, in turn, to improve the lives of patients and caregivers. PharmFilm is protected by our patent portfolio, which currently includes at least 204 issued patents worldwide, of which at least 40 are U.S. patents, and more than 120 pending patent applications worldwide. Several of the patents in this intellectual property portfolio are utilized in each of our proprietary pipeline products. We are continuing to develop additional intellectual property and know-how related to the applications and engineering of PharmFilm alone or in combination with other technologies to create product capabilities that have compelling value propositions.
PharmFilm is comprised of proprietary polymer compositions that serve as film formers to hold active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, and excipients in place. Proprietary and patent-protected compositions, formulations and manufacturing techniques and technology are employed to ensure that the API is distributed uniformly throughout the film and that target absorption levels are achieved. Our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes enable PharmFilm to be engineered to fit a variety of target product profiles in order to best address unmet patient needs present within specific disease states. PharmFilm, which is similar in thickness and size to a postage stamp, can be administered via buccal, sublingual or lingual oral delivery.
We believe the innovative nature of our drug delivery platform has the potential to offer a number of meaningful advantages to patients, caregivers and physicians compared to current standard of care therapies, including:
•preferred alternative to more invasive drug administration methods such as injection, rectal or nasal applications;
•faster, or at least equivalent, onset of action;
•ease of administration and availability (no device required, no gel to transport);
•direct absorption into the bloodstream reducing or avoiding “first pass” effects in the liver;
•reduced gastrointestinal, or GI, side effects;
•positive dosing outcomes, especially for patients with physical (e.g., dysphagia) or psychological barriers to other methods of drug administration;
•stable, durable, portable and quick dissolving (with or without water);
•customizable delivery routes for tailored pharmacokinetic, or PK, profiles (buccal, sublingual or lingual); and
•customizable taste profiles.

Proprietary Growth Drivers
Complex Molecule Portfolio
Our PharmFilm® technology allows us to develop medicines that offer non-invasive delivery, customized suitability for patients with dysphagia, or trouble swallowing, can be administered without water and ensures consistent therapeutic dosing. We believe that these characteristics will permit us to achieve the desired patient outcomes, while potentially reducing the total cost of patient care.
We have developed a proprietary pipeline of complex molecule-based product candidates as alternatives to invasively administered standard of care therapeutics addressing large market opportunities. The active programs in our complex molecule pipeline portfolio are:
•AQST-109-SF (or sublingual film)– the first and only orally delivered epinephrine product candidate that has shown clinical results comparable to autoinjectors (such as EpiPen® and Auvi-Q®) for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Epinephrine is the standard of care in the treatment of anaphylaxis and is currently administered via intramuscular injection (IM) including auto-injectors, such as EpiPen® and Auvi-Q®, which require patients or caregivers to inject epinephrine into their thighs during an emergency allergic reaction. As a result of this route of administration, many patients and their caregivers are reluctant to use currently available products. However, AQST-109 would, if approved by the FDA, allow a patient to simply place a dissolvable strip, approximately the size and weight of a postage stamp, under the tongue, providing an appropriate medication where it is needed, when it is needed and in a form preferred by patients.
We completed a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial for AQST-109 in Canada. This Phase 1 randomized, single-ascending dose study was performed in order to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacologic profile of AQST-109. On February 25, 2022, we reported positive topline data from Part 1 of our crossover study of AQST-109, EPIPHAST, a randomized, open-label, three-part adaptive design, crossover study in healthy adult subjects comparing the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of epinephrine delivered via AQST-109 oral film compared to epinephrine IM. The EPIPHAST study was also conducted in Canada. In Part 1 of the EPIPHAST study, multiple oral film formulations and dosage strengths of AQST-109 were evaluated. The lead formulation of AQST-109 has shown clinically meaningful blood concentrations when delivered in two different physical configurations, with a median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of 13.5 minutes and 22.5 minutes, respectively. Part 1 also showed arithmetic mean maximum concentrations (Cmax) of 771 pg/mL and 580 pg/mL for the two configurations, or geometric mean Cmax values of 258pg/mL and 268pg/mL for the two configurations, respectively. These geometric mean Cmax and median Tmax values are consistent with those previously reported for approved injectable epinephrine devices such as EpiPen. Under the EPIPHAST study, the healthy volunteers were also exposed to a 0.5mg IM of epinephrine, allowing for a comparison with the PK, safety, and tolerability of the higher end of the approved dosage range of epinephrine, consistent with guidance received from the FDA in a written response to our Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for AQST-109. The findings show that these two configurations of the selected AQST-109 formulation can deliver clinically meaningful blood concentrations of epinephrine sooner than that observed with the higher dose of epinephrine IM injection, and in line with existing epinephrine autoinjectors. In addition, dosing with AQST-109 resulted in changes in blood pressure and heart rate that were comparable to epinephrine auto-injectors. The EPIPHAST trial indicated that treatment was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events, significant medical events, or treatment-related severe adverse events reported. On February 24, 2022, the FDA cleared our IND, allowing for clinical investigation of AQST-109 in the U.S. The FDA confirmed that the 505(b)(2) approval pathway is acceptable for the development of AQST-109. The FDA granted Fast Track designation in March 2022 to AQST-109 for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.
In April 2022, we reported positive topline results from Part 2 of the EPIPHAST study for AQST-109. Part 2 is a randomized, crossover design comparing AQST-109 12mg to epinephrine IM 0.3mg. Utilizing a replicate crossover design, Part 2 confirmed in a larger population of 24 healthy subjects the key PK and PD measures observed in Part 1 of the EPIPHAST study and the first-in-human PK study. The median Tmax was observed to be 15 minutes for AQST-109, compared to 50 minutes for the epinephrine IM 0.3mg. 
In July 2022, we reported positive topline results from the final two arms of Part 3 of the EPIPHAST study for AQST-109. The purpose of Part 3 was to continue to study the administration of the film under a variety of conditions to further characterize its PK, PD and safety. The final two arms were designed to assess the impact of (1) administering the film sublingually two minutes after consuming a peanut butter sandwich and (2) swallowing the film whole immediately with water. Part 3 study results demonstrated consistent Tmax of 12 minutes with sublingual administration of AQST-109 epinephrine oral film, after consuming a peanut butter sandwich. Part 3 study also showed positive results with an unexpectedly high level of gastrointestinal absorption after swallowing AQST-109 whole immediately with water that was distinct from the sublingually absorbed profile.
In September 2022, we reported positive topline results from the EPIPHAST II trial for AQST-109. The EPIPHAST II trial was designed to compare single doses of AQST-109 to EpiPen 0.3mg and epinephrine IM 0.3mg, as well as repeat doses of AQST-109 to repeat doses of epinephrine IM 0.3mg. Results from the single dose administration showed AQST-109 achieved a significantly faster Tmax (12 minutes), compared to both EpiPen (22.5 minutes) and epinephrine IM 0.3mg (45 minutes). AQST-109 repeat dosing provided significantly higher drug plasma concentrations, with a Tmax of 8 minutes after administration, and extensive absorption was observed. The mean Cmax of AQST-109 was 465 pg/mL after one dose and 2,958 pg/mL after two doses. In comparison, the epinephrine IM 0.3mg Cmax was 489 pg/mL after one dose and 911 pg/mL after two doses. The single dose of EpiPen resulted in a Cmax of 869 pg/mL. Changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were similar after a single dose of AQST-109 when compared to a single dose of EpiPen. This data, along with the data from the completed EPIPHAST study, was the basis for our second End-of-Phase 2 (EoP2) meeting with the FDA. We received a positive written feedback from the FDA after our initial EoP2 meeting request to discuss Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) for AQST-109, which we believe indicates that our approach to characterizing attributes of AQST-109 appears reasonable in the context of a potential future filing. 
In late December 2022, we received the final minutes from the EoP2 meeting with the FDA which provided clarity as to the FDA’s expectations regarding key program areas. We are conducting an additional PK study to aide in the selection of the comparator products to be used in the upcoming pivotal trial in the second half of 2023. We anticipate conducting the pivotal PK study in the third quarter of 2023, and continue to plan for a potential launch in 2025, if approved by the FDA.
•AQST-108-SF – AQST-108 is composed of the prodrug dipivefrin which is enzymatically cleaved into epinephrine after administration. Dipivefrin is currently available outside of the U.S. for ophthalmic indications. A sublingual film formulation 
delivering systemic epinephrine has been development by Aquestive for the treatment of conditions other than anaphylaxis. Based on topline results of a recent second Phase 1 PK trial in 28 healthy adult volunteers conducted by Aquestive, AQST-108 was generally well-tolerated, with systemic adverse events observed that are consistent with the known adverse events profile for epinephrine. Additional indications and delivery methods are currently being explored preclinically. Upon completion of the preclinical work, we will request a pre-IND meeting for AQST-108 with the FDA and plan to disclose the indication and path forward for development, once we have received feedback from the FDA.
Proprietary CNS Product Candidate
We believe the application of PharmFilm is particularly valuable and relevant to patients suffering from certain CNS disorders to meet patients' unmet medical needs and to solve patients' therapeutic problems. We believe there remains significant opportunity to develop additional products in the CNS market. Additionally, our know-how and proprietary position have broad application beyond CNS, and we plan to explore the applications of PharmFilm in other disease areas. Our most advanced asset within our proprietary CNS portfolio, focused in epilepsy, is as follows:
•Libervant™ – a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered soluble film formulation of diazepam is our most advanced proprietary investigational product candidate. Aquestive developed Libervant as an alternative to device-dependent rescue therapies currently available to patients with refractory epilepsy, which are a rectal gel and nasal sprays. In August 2022, the FDA granted tentative approval for Libervant for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older. The FDA has concluded that Libervant has met all required quality, safety, and efficacy standards for approval. Due to an existing FDA regulatory grant of orphan drug market exclusivity for Valtoco®, a diazepam nasal spray product sold by another company, Libervant is not yet eligible for marketing in the United States. As a result of the FDA determination, the FDA cannot give final approval for Libervant until the expiration or inapplicability of the orphan drug market exclusivity, including, for example, by a reversal of the FDA’s decision and determination that Libervant is “clinically superior” to Valtoco. We are actively engaging the FDA regarding its determination. We provided the FDA with additional clinical data in September 2022 and were informed that the FDA was reviewing this data. Furthermore, in October 2022, we provided the FDA with a draft protocol for a head-to-head comparative PK study of Libervant versus the competing product. We continue to believe that, particularly in the case of our submitted studies on the effect of food on the absorption of diazepam formulations, Libervant has the distinct advantage of being able to be readily administered when needed without regard to food, providing an important benefit to patients. However, overcoming the orphan drug marketing exclusivity is difficult to establish, with limited precedent, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our position seeking to overcome such market exclusivity and approve Libervant for U.S. market access earlier than January 2027, the schedule date for expiration of orphan drug market exclusivity, if this effort is not successful. Further, there can be no assurance that a competitor will not obtain other FDA market exclusivity that blocks U.S. market access for Libervant. More details on this product approval are described in the “Competition” section of this Item I. Business of this Form 10-K.
In September 2022, we announced the grant of an exclusive license to Atnahs Pharma UK Limited ("Pharmanovia") for Pharmanovia to develop and commercialize Libervant for the treatment of prolonged or acute, convulsive seizures in all ages in certain countries of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway and the Middle East and North Africa (the "Territory") during the term of the Pharmanovia licensee. Pharmanovia will lead the regulatory and commercialization activities for Libervant in the Territory and the Company will serve as the exclusive sole manufacturer and supplier of Libervant in the Territory. 
Licensed Commercial Products and Product Candidates
Our portfolio also includes products and product candidates that we have licensed, or will seek to license, or for which we have licensed our intellectual property for commercialization. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our licensed product portfolio generated $40.0 million and $42.3 million in revenue to Aquestive, respectively. Those products include:
•Suboxone® – a sublingual film formulation of buprenorphine and naloxone, respectively an opioid agonist and antagonist, that is marketed in the United States and internationally for the treatment of opioid dependence. Suboxone was launched by our licensee, Indivior Inc., or Indivior, in 2010. Suboxone is the most prescribed branded product in its category and was the first sublingual film product for the treatment of opioid dependence. We are the sole and exclusive supplier and manufacturer of Suboxone and have produced over 2.5 billion doses of Suboxone since its launch in 2010. As of December 31, 2022, Suboxone retains approximately 34% film market share as generic film-based products have penetrated this market. We have filed patent infringement lawsuits against certain companies relating to generic film-based products for buprenorphine-naloxone. More details regarding these lawsuits are described in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20, Contingencies. 
•Exservan® – an oral film formulation of riluzole, has been developed by the Company for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We believe that Exservan can bring meaningful assistance to patients who are diagnosed with ALS and face difficulties swallowing traditional forms of medication. Exservan was approved by the FDA on November 22, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced the grant of a license to Zambon S.p.A. ("Zambon") for the development and commercialization of Exservan in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of ALS. Zambon is a multinational pharmaceutical company with a focus on the CNS therapeutic area. Under the terms of the license agreement with Zambon, an upfront payment was 
paid to Aquestive for the development and commercialization rights of Exservan in the EU, and Aquestive will be paid development and sales milestone payments and low double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the EU. Zambon is responsible for the regulatory approval and marketing of Exservan in the countries where Zambon seeks to market the product, and Aquestive will be responsible for the development and manufacture of the product. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Aquestive received a $0.5 million milestone payment upon in connection with the receipt of regulatory approval for Exservan pursuant to the terms of the license agreement with Zambon.
In January 2021, we announced that the Company granted an exclusive license to Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Holdings America, Inc. ("MTHA") for the commercialization in the United States of Exservan. MTHA is a multinational pharmaceutical company with a focus on patients with ALS. The product was launched by MTHA in June 2021. Under the terms of the MTHA license agreement, Aquestive is the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of Exservan for MTHA in the United States. Exservan may potentially fulfill a critical need for ALS patients, given it can be administered safely and easily, twice daily, without water.
In March 2022, we announced the grant of an exclusive license to Haisco Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. ("Haisco") for Haisco to develop and commercialize Exservan for the treatment of ALS in China. Haisco is a China-based public pharmaceutical company. Haisco will lead the regulatory and commercialization activities for Exservan in China. Aquestive will serve as the exclusive sole manufacturer and supplier for Exservan in China. Under the the terms of license agreement with Haisco, as amended, Aquestive received a $7.0 million upfront cash payment, and will receive regulatory milestone payments, double-digit royalties on net sales of Exservan in China, and earn manufacturing revenue upon the sale of Exservan in China. 
•KYNMOBI® – a sublingual film formulation of apomorphine, which is a dopamine agonist, was developed to treat episodic off-periods in Parkinson’s disease. We licensed our intellectual property to Cynapsus Therapeutics, Inc., a company that was acquired by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Sunovion, for the commercialization of KYNMOBI under an Agreement dated April 1, 2016, as amended (the "Sunovion License Agreement"). KYNMOBI was approved by the FDA on May 21, 2020 and commercially launched by Sunovion in September 2020. On November 3, 2020, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Monetization Agreement") with MAM Pangolin Royalty, LLC, an affiliate of Marathon Asset Management ("Marathon"). Under the terms of the Monetization Agreement, we sold all of our contractual rights to receive royalties and milestone payments due under the Sunovion License Agreement related to Sunovion's apomorphine product, KYNMOBI. 
•Zuplenz® – an oral soluble film formulation of ondansetron, a 5-HT antagonist, was developed for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy and post-operative recovery. Ondansetron is available as branded and generic products as intravenous injections, intramuscular injections, orally dissolving tablets, oral solution tablets, and film. We licensed commercial rights for Zuplenz to Hypera in Brazil (which Hypera markets as Ondif). Hypera received approval to market Zuplenz in Brazil from the Brazilian regulatory authority (ANVISA) on February 21, 2022. We licensed commercial rights for Zuplenz to Fortovia Therapeutics Inc. (previously Midatech Pharma PLC, "Fortovia") in the United States, Canada, and China. Fortovia launched Zuplenz in the United States in 2015. We had been the sole and exclusive manufacturer of Zuplenz for Fortovia. On August 31, 2020 Fortovia filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. On January 29, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court approved an agreement pursuant to which the license and supply agreement between Aquestive and Fortovia was terminated, and all rights to commercialize Zuplenz returned to us, effective January 30, 2021. 
•AzstarysTM – an FDA-approved, once-daily product for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients age six years or older. AZSTARYS consists of serdexmethylphenidate, a prodrug of d-methylphenidate (d-MPH), co-formulated with immediate release d-MPH. In March 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Zevra Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly KemPharm, Inc.) (“Zevra”), to terminate a Collaboration and License Agreement entered into by the Company and Zevra in April 2011. Under this termination arrangement, the Company has the right to participate in any and all value that Zevra may derive from the commercialization or any other monetization of KP-415 and KP-484 compounds or their derivatives. Among these monetization transactions are those related to any business combinations involving Zevra and collaborations, royalty arrangements, or other transactions from which Zevra may realize value from these compounds, including the product Azstarys. On March 2, 2021, Zevra announced FDA approval of Azstarys for the treatment of ADHD. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received payment of $2.0 million under this arrangement, which was included in License and royalty revenues.
•Libervant™ - a buccal film formulation of diazepam tentatively approved by the FDA for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.  The Company entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Atnahs Pharma UK Limited, a company registered in England and Wales ("Pharmanovia"), effective as of September 26, 2022 (the "Pharmanovia Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company granted Pharmanovia an exclusive license to certain of the Company's intellectual property to develop and commercialize Libervant for the treatment of prolonged or acute, convulsive seizures in all ages in certain countries of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway and the Middle East and North Africa (the "Territory") during the term of the Pharmanovia Agreement. Under the Pharmanovia Agreement, Pharmanovia will lead the regulatory and commercialization activities for Libervant in the Territory and the Company will serve as the exclusive sole manufacturer and supplier of Libervant in the Territory.
•Sympazan® – an oral soluble film formulation of clobazam used for the treatment of seizures associated with a rare, intractable form of epilepsy known as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or LGS, in patients aged two years of age or older, was approved by the FDA on November 1, 2018. We commercially launched Sympazan in December 2018. On October 26, 2022, the Company entered into a License Agreement with Otter Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a subsidiary of Assertio Holdings, Inc. (“Assertio”), a specialty pharmaceutical company offering differentiated products to patients, pursuant to which the Company granted an exclusive, worldwide license of its intellectual property for Sympazan to Assertio during the term of that agreement. The Company is the exclusive sole manufacturer and supplier of Sympazan for Assertio.
Market Overview
Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic allergic reaction that can be triggered by certain foods, medications, insect stings and latex, among other allergens. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis typically occur within seconds or minutes of exposure and may include low blood pressure, skin rash or itching, constriction of the airway and difficulty breathing and nausea and vomiting. If not treated immediately, anaphylaxis can lead to death due to airway restriction or cardiac arrest. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening systemic allergic reaction, with an estimated incidence of 50 to 112 episodes per 100,000 people per year. An international study found that hospital admissions for anaphylaxis has increased over a 15-year study period. The most common causes of reactions that can include anaphylaxis are medications, foods (such as peanuts), and venom from insect stings. Because anaphylaxis can progress quickly, the ability to administer a reliable and accurate dose of epinephrine as quickly as possible following a reaction is critical for patient recovery and survival. 
Treatment of anaphylaxis typically consists of an intramuscular injection of epinephrine administered at the earliest opportunity, followed by additional intramuscular or intravenous injections as needed. A generic form of epinephrine auto-injector (brand form EpiPen®) is the leading self-administered form of epinephrine. People with known allergies and who are at risk for anaphylaxis are advised to carry two epinephrine auto-injectors with them at all times and self-administer at the first signs of an anaphylactic reaction. Auto-injectors can be inconvenient to transport and many patients and caregivers dislike injections as a delivery method. Proper dosing and the ability to effectively administer epinephrine in a timely, reliable manner is critical for patients experiencing anaphylaxis. However, we believe that the inability to administer complex molecules via oral administration has limited the development of treatments that have the potential to provide significant patient benefit. We designed AQST-109, a “first of its kind” oral sublingual film formulation delivering systemic epinephrine, as a rescue medicine for the treatment of anaphylaxis, using Aquestive’s proprietary PharmFilm® technologies, to improve patient compliance and lower the total cost of care. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for a non-injectable, easier to administer product with a fast onset of action. A product with this profile could enable patients to conveniently and rapidly self-administer a reliable and accurate dose of epinephrine during an anaphylactic reaction, which we believe will improve patient compliance. Subject to our achieving regulatory approval of this product candidate, which we cannot assure, we believe AQST-109 has the potential to reduce the treatment burden currently associated with intramuscular injections and may lower costs to the healthcare system associated with anaphylaxis, due to inaccurate or untimely dosing.
Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a chronic CNS disorder characterized by recurrent seizure activity. There are 3.4 million people in the United States suffering from epilepsy. According to Symphony Health data, antiepileptic medications generated billions of dollars of sales in the United States in 2022. The direct (medical) and indirect (lost wages and productivity) annual costs associated with epileptic patients in the United States are significant.
Epilepsy treatment regimens typically consist of chronic and acute management therapies. Chronic medicines are used on a daily basis to suppress seizure activity. Approximately 1.1 million of those suffering from epilepsy will continue to suffer with breakthrough seizures and may require an acute (rescue) management strategy. Patients are routinely prescribed antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs, as “maintenance” therapy to control chronic seizure activity. Most AEDs specifically target neuronal excitation or neuronal inhibitory pathways. Patients are routinely prescribed benzodiazepines as “rescue” therapy for the management of acute seizure emergencies.
Rescue therapies are administered as needed in the event of an acute seizure to rapidly terminate seizure activity. One of the most effective benzodiazepines currently available for the treatment of acute seizures is diazepam. Diazepam has historically been marketed as a product administered rectally and more recently, a nasal spray product was introduced to the market. Rectal administration of this drug 
presents a particular challenge for patients. We developed our product candidate Libervant as an alternative to the device-dependent rescue therapies currently available to patients with refractory epilepsy.  See “Our Product Portfolio and Pipeline” above and “Competition” below in this Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K for additional information concerning the Libervant FDA approval process and market access issues.
There are multiple epileptic syndromes including LGS, which is a rare, intractable form of epilepsy. Patients with LGS are often drug resistant, predisposing them to recurrent seizures, and are typically prescribed a combination of antiepileptic medications, which often includes clobazam. Clobazam (branded name Onfi) is available in both a tablet and suspension formulation.  Generic versions of the clobazam tablet and suspension formulation are available to patients, as well. Sympazan was developed as an alternative to these other routes of administration of clobazam.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We operate two manufacturing and primary packaging facilities located in Portage, Indiana, where we currently manufacture our licensed products, Suboxone, Exservan, Ondif and Sympazan, on an exclusive basis. These facilities are expected to have a combined capacity to accommodate the production of our proprietary product pipeline candidates and licensed products, without any current need for additional infrastructure. In 2022, we completed work to expand our manufacturing capabilities to include serialization and secondary packaging. This expansion allows us to support our existing and possible future business collaborations more broadly. With the GMP facilities in Indiana, we will continue to explore possible additional manufacturing capabilities in 2023. We will also continue to consider our anticipated facilities and infrastructure needs as our product development grows. We have produced over 1.0 billion doses in the last five years. As a company, our research and development laboratories are registered with the DEA for Schedule II-V drugs.
We are subject to various regulatory requirements, such as the regulations of the FDA, the DEA, the EU and other foreign health authorities such as the TGA. We are required to register our facilities and adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) standards. These standards require manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures throughout the entire manufacturing process. Our facilities have undergone inspections by the FDA, DEA, TGA, and several quality assurance inspections by pharmaceutical companies for cGMP compliance. In each case, the facilities have passed inspection and are subject to periodic re-inspection. Failure to comply with these and other statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse events with the product or product complaints must be reported and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval.
We purchase our raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, from qualified, approved vendors both domestically and internationally. While we typically source raw materials from the lowest cost provider whenever possible, we continue to pursue a multi-supplier strategy for critical raw materials, where available or appropriate. Our product packaging foil is supplied by a single manufacturer. Such manufacturer utilizes multiple manufacturing facilities for production of our packaging foil. We may enter into more formal supply agreements in the future as production volumes increase and are more predictive.
Subject to the supervision of our internal clinical development staff, we use third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to administer and conduct many aspects of our planned clinical trials including monitoring and managing data, and we will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols. We intend for such CROs to play a significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data from such trials.
Competition
We compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that develop and commercialize therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of disease areas and indications. Additionally, we compete with companies that utilize advanced drug administration platforms, such as oral, injectable, intranasal, transdermal patch and pulmonary delivery, to create improved therapeutics over current standards of care. This industry is highly competitive and new products and technologies evolve and come to market at a rapid pace. The companies operating in this market include multinational organizations, established biotechnology companies, single product pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and generic drug companies. Many of the larger, established organizations currently have commercialization capabilities in-house, and may have partnership or license agreements in place with smaller companies for commercialization rights. These companies may develop new drugs to treat the indications that we target or seek to have existing drugs approved for the treatment of the indications that we target.
We will compete with commercialized products in all markets for which we have approval and are seeking approval.
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid evolution and advancements of technologies, intense competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any products and product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.  Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products and the ease of use and effectiveness of any companion diagnostics.  The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products.
On January 10, 2020, a competitor of Aquestive obtained FDA approval of its diazepam nasal spray drug candidate, Valtoco, and was granted orphan-drug-exclusivity for this drug commencing as of January 10, 2020.  A company that obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug receives orphan market exclusivity for that drug for the designated indication for a period of seven years from the grant date in the United States. This orphan drug exclusivity approval prevents a subsequent product seeking FDA approval from being marketed in the United States during the exclusivity period for the same active moiety for the same orphan drug indication except in the case where the drug candidate sponsor is able to demonstrate, and the FDA concludes, that the later drug is “clinically superior” to the approved products (e.g., safer, more effective, or providing a major contribution to patient care) within the meaning of FDA regulations and guidance.  In assessing whether a drug candidate sponsor has demonstrated that its drug candidate provides a “major contribution to patient care” over and above the currently approved drugs, which is evaluated by the FDA on a case by case basis, there is no single objective standard and the FDA may, in appropriate circumstances, consider such factors as convenience of treatment location, duration of treatment, patient comfort, reduced treatment burden, advances in ease and comfort of drug administration, longer periods between doses, and potential for self-administration.
In August 2022, the FDA granted tentative approval for Libervant for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older. The FDA concluded that Libervant has met all required quality, safety, and efficacy standards for approval. Due to an existing FDA regulatory grant of orphan drug market exclusivity for our competitor's diazepam nasal spray product discussed above, Libervant is not yet eligible for marketing in the United States. As a result of the FDA determination, the FDA cannot give final approval for Libervant until the expiration or inapplicability of the orphan drug market exclusivity. We are actively engaging the FDA regarding its determination. We provided the FDA with additional clinical data in September 2022 and were informed that the FDA was reviewing this data. Furthermore, in October 2022, we provided the FDA with a draft protocol for a head-to-head comparative PK study of Libervant versus the competing product. We continue to believe that, particularly in the case of our submitted studies on the effect of food on the absorption of diazepam formulations, Libervant has the distinct advantage of being able to be readily administered when needed without regard to food, providing an important benefit to patients. However, overcoming the orphan drug marketing exclusivity is difficult to establish, with limited precedent, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our position seeking to overcome such market exclusivity and approve Libervant for U.S. market access. Further, there can be no assurance that a competitor will not obtain other FDA market exclusivity that blocks U.S. market access for Libervant. 
Material Agreements
More details regarding material agreements are described in Part IV Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6, Material Agreements. 
Intellectual Property
We currently seek, and intend to continue seeking, patent protection whenever commercially reasonable for any patentable aspects of our product candidates and related technology or any new products or product candidates we acquire in the future. Where our intellectual property is not protected by patents, we may seek to protect it through other means, including maintenance of trade secrets and careful protection of our proprietary information.
In addition, we intend to seek orphan drug exclusivity in jurisdictions in which it is available. A prerequisite to orphan drug exclusivity in the United States and in the EU is orphan drug designation. An orphan drug designation may be granted where a drug is developed specifically to treat a rare or uncommon medical condition. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first regulatory approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, meaning that the applicable regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in certain very limited circumstances, for a period of 7 years in the United States and 10 years in the EU. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for the indication protected by exclusivity, or the same drug for a different indication.
Patents
Our patent portfolio currently comprises at least 232 issued patents worldwide, of which at least 43 are U.S. patents, and more than 120 pending patent applications worldwide. These issued patents and pending patent applications provide both process of making and composition of matter protection for our PharmFilm® technology and products and product candidates, including Suboxone and our PharmFilm® formulations of tadalafil, diazepam, clobazam, riluzole, and epinephrine. These patents and, if issued as patents, pending patent applications will likely expire between 2023 and 2042. The pending patent applications filed in 2017 will provide composition of matter and process of making protection for our PharmFilm® dosage formulations of diazepam and epinephrine and, if issued as patents, will likely expire by 2042. The projected expiration dates exclude any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
PharmFilm® – Our Oral Film Technology
Our PharmFilm® technology is covered by at least 12 patent families. These patent families provide process, composition of matter protection for our PharmFilm® technology, and comprise at least 49 issued patents worldwide, of which at least 12 are U.S. patents, and related pending patent applications worldwide. The patents and pending patent applications, if issued as patents, will likely expire between 2023 and 2042, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
The PharmFilm® technology patents and/or patent applications also generically and specifically protect the technology utilized in the products and product candidates in our CNS programs, our complex molecule programs, as well as our licensee programs. For example, encompassed within our platform technology patents and/or patent applications is specific coverage directed to PharmFilm dosage formulations of CNS molecules such as diazepam. Also encompassed within our platform technology is coverage for our complex molecule program which includes molecules such as epinephrine. Our platform technology patents and/or patent applications further cover the products Suboxone and Zuplenz, as well as our formulations of the molecules apomorphine and tadalafil, which are part of our licensed programs. The expiration dates for patents covering these products and product candidates, and for pending applications if issued as patents, extend from 2023 to 2042, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
We note that several of our issued patents are or have been involved in administrative proceedings, such as reexamination and inter partes review at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and opposition at the European Patent Organization, or EPO.
Certain of our patents and patent applications, if granted, will be published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA. If any of these potential generic competitors claim that their product will not infringe our listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, then they must send notice to us once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. We may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification, which would automatically prevent the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant.
The rest of our patent portfolio largely relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to our product development portfolio and other product candidates and related compositions and/or manufacturing processes.
Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Information
We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our colleagues, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances, nor used outside the scope of their employment. In the case of our colleagues, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention provisions. Further, we generally require confidentiality agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Trademarks
We also rely on trademarks to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our trademarks or registered trademarks are filed in the United States and other select geographical areas.
Regulatory
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending applications, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
•completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process takes many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including current Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted.
The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND application must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements, which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

Phase 1 | In Phase 1, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. 
Phase 2 | Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. 
Phase 3 | Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee for each prescription drug product, which beginning in Fiscal Year 2018 replaced the product and establishment fees.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA endeavors to review applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review Priority Review applications within six to eight months.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities and possibly conducts a sponsor inspection, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the NDA and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The review by the FDA is two months for a Class I resubmission and six months for a Class 2 resubmission. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS, or Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess whether the REMS plan is effective. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.
Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Ongoing adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs and NDA specifications after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and obtain licenses from certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs or other applicable laws, such as adverse event recordkeeping and reporting. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and training and compliance efforts in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs or other applicable laws, such as adverse event recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Regulatory authorities may require remediation, withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems or new concerns are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, 
injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution may be pursued.
In addition, any distribution of prescription drug products must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act or the DSCSA, has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. These requirements are being phased in over a ten-year period. The DSCSA ultimately will require product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA replaced the prior drug “pedigree” requirements under the PDMA and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers. These licensing requirements preempt states from imposing licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or otherwise encompassed by standards established by the FDA pursuant to the DSCSA. Until the FDA promulgates regulations to address the DSCSA’s new national licensing standard, current state licensing requirements typically remain in effect.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
ANDA Approval Process
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by submitting an ANDA to the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved Suitability Petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.
505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the branded reference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents with claims that cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (ii) such patent has expired; (iii) the date on which such patent expires; or (iv) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If the reference drug NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent related exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot review, or in some cases, approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. For example, a company may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains an active moiety that has not been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule or ion responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During the five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety and that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug, except that FDA may accept an application for filing after four years if the follow-on applicant makes a paragraph IV certification.
A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation of a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan indication for which it received the designation, it will not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, we may still be subject to competition. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
In the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
The Federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal False Claims Act in 
connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,000 and $25,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals can bring actions under the Federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act.
In addition to the privacy and security requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (which we refer to collectively as HIPAA), HIPAA also expanded and created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
There are also an increasing number of state laws with requirements for manufacturers and/or marketers of pharmaceutical products. Some states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement requires manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state, and soon federal, authorities.
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the previous calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
In addition, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations impose certain obligations on entities subject to the law, such as health plans and most healthcare providers, and their business associates who provide certain services involving the use or disclosure of HIPAA protected health information on their behalf, with respect to the privacy and security of such protected health information. Further, most states have enacted laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances, such as specific disease states.
Compliance with such laws and regulations requires substantial resources. While we no longer engage in the commercial sale of any proprietary drug products, because of the breadth of these various fraud and abuse laws, it is possible that some of our business activities in the past could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices did not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other settlement to resolve allegations of violations of these laws, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, we may be subject to contractual damages and reputational harm as result of such non-compliance. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In the European Union, or EU, we may seek marketing authorization under either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following a national authorization, the applicant may seek further marketing authorizations from other EU countries under a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
In the EU, medicinal products designated as orphan products benefit from financial incentives such as reductions in marketing authorization application fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity following medicinal product approval. For a medicinal product to qualify as orphan: (i) it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating; (ii) the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than five in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
United States Healthcare Reform
Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the PPACA, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, or commonly known as the donut hole in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse, and enforcement. These changes impacted existing government healthcare programs and are resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs to individuals with an income of up to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the PPACA. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact our sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval, business and financial condition. Where new patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new Medicaid options made available through the PPACA, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. Various portions of the PPACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court, previous administrations issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost-sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the PPACA. It is unclear whether the PPACA will be overturned, repealed, replaced, or further amended. 
There has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. On July 24, 2020, four Executive Orders were signed and enacted directing the Secretary of HHS to: (1) eliminate protection under an Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for certain retrospective price reductions provided by drug manufacturers to sponsors of Medicare Part D plans or pharmacy benefit managers that are not applied at the point-of-sale, which may be delayed until 2032 by the recent Consolidated Appropriations Act ; (2) allow the importation of certain drugs from other countries through individual waivers, permit the re-importation of insulin products, and prioritize 
finalization of FDA’s December 2019 proposed rule to permit the importation of drugs from Canada; (3) ensure that payment by the Medicare program for certain Medicare Part B drugs is not higher than the payment by other comparable countries (depending on whether pharmaceutical manufacturers agree to other measures); and (4) allow certain low-income individuals receiving insulin and epinephrine purchased by a Federally Qualified Health Center, or FQHC, as part of the 340B drug program to purchase those drugs at the discounted price paid by the FQHC. On October 1, 2020, the FDA issued its final rule allowing importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada. On September 13, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing HHS to implement a rulemaking plan to test a payment model, pursuant to which Medicare would pay, for certain high-cost prescription drugs and biological products covered by Medicare Part B, no more than the most-favored-nation price (i.e., the lowest price) after adjustments, for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that has a comparable per-capita gross domestic product. While some proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress has indicated that they will continue to pursue new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
Most recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, included a number of significant drug pricing reforms, which include the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (beginning in 2026) that requires manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and a redesign of the Part D benefit, as part of which manufacturers are required to provide discounts on Part D drugs (beginning in 2025).
It is difficult at this time to predict whether additional executive or legislative initiatives may be proposed related to drug pricing. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of products for which we receive regulatory approval or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our products and product candidates, if and when approved, is partially dependent on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from public (i.e., federal and state government) and private (i.e., commercial) payors. These third‑party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy, either in whole or in part, if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third‑party payors will continue to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost‑containment mechanisms, and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
As discussed above, the cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third‑party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures, given the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional regulatory and legislative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third‑party payor policies, as well as healthcare legislative reforms.
Additionally, discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products must be offered under various federal and state healthcare programs, including: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare Part B Program and Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discount Programs, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule Program, and the Health Resources and Services Administration’s 340B Drug Pricing Program. Specific prices must be reported to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose us to penalties.
Some third‑party payors may have cost‑containment measures to be adopted or implemented in the future, including any changes to any Medicare reimbursement program, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. There can be no assurance that our products and product candidates will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products and product candidates will be considered cost‑effective by third‑party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available, or that the third‑party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products and product candidates, if approved, profitably.
Additional information regarding these programs is discussed under the heading “If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for our products or product candidates, if approved, their commercial success may be severely hindered” in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Regulation
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other regulations, in each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 130 colleagues. All of our colleagues were employed in the U.S. Of these colleagues, 16 are directly involved in research and development, 81 are involved in manufacturing operations, and 33 are involved in business development and general and administrative activities. Our colleagues are not represented by a labor union. 
Culture and Colleagues Engagement
We believe that our colleagues are an essential element of our strategy and critical to our continued success. Our corporate values – safety, compliance, collaboration, integrity and high performance are built on the foundation that the colleagues we hire, the steps we use to engage them and the way we treat one another promote the creativity, innovation and productivity that spurs the Company’s success.
Supporting that philosophy, our management team is responsible for ensuring that our policies and procedures reflect and reinforce the Company’s desired corporate culture including policies and procedures related to risk management, ethics and compliance. 
We engage advisors to ensure that we design, plan and execute competitive compensation strategies and benefit programs to help us attract and retain a diverse workforce with the appropriate skills and talent that drive the organization's success. We also engage our colleagues in important dialogue regarding organizational performance, and reward our colleagues accordingly to create a successful and attractive workplace. We are committed to creating a culture of inclusion in which all colleagues have the opportunity to be heard, make an impact and thrive.
Colleagues’ Health, Wellness and Safety
The well-being of our colleagues is a top priority, and we are committed to creating a safe and healthy workplace. We provide ongoing training in support of that commitment.
 We remain proactive in ensuring the safety of our colleagues, their families, our patients and our products as we continue to monitor the COVID-19 landscape both in the United States and globally. We were able to overcome many of the challenges presented by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic by engaging colleagues early and often through organizational messaging aimed at reinforcing our commitment to safety. We continue to engage and educate our colleagues to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to minimize any impact to our business. We follow the CDC guidelines and provide testing to and quarantining of colleagues, when necessary.
Environmental Safety
We have few environmental risks but are committed to be part of the global solution. We run environmentally responsible laboratory waste collection, recycling and disposal programs. We educate and encourage our colleagues to be environmentally responsible. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with government and environmental regulations.
