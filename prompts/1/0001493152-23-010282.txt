ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Bitech Technologies Corporation (formerly, Spine Injury Solutions Inc.) (the “Company”, “we” or “us”) was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 4, 1998. In connection with the Company’s planned expansion of its business following the completion of the acquisition of Bitech Mining Corporation, a Wyoming corporation (“Bitech Mining”), it filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on April 29, 2022 to change its corporate name to Bitech Technologies Corporation.


Currently, we have refocused our business development plans as we seek to position ourselves as a global technology solution enabler dedicated to providing a suite of green energy solutions with industry focus on green data centers, commercial and residential utility, EV infrastructure, and other renewable energy initiatives. We plan to pursue these innovative energy technologies through research and development, planned acquisitions of other green energy technologies and plans to become a grid-balancing operator using Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) solutions and applying new green technologies in power plants as a technology enabler in the green energy sector. While participating in the clean energy economy, we are seeking business partnerships with defensible technology innovators and renewable energy providers to facilitate investments, provide new market entries toward emerging-growth regions and implement or manufacture these innovative, scalable energy system solutions with technological focuses on smart grids, Building Energy Management System (BEMS), energy storage, and EV infrastructure.
 
To accelerate growth of a planned intellectual property (IP) portfolio through acquisition strategies, we plan to execute our “Smart Acquisition Model” depicted in the diagram below with selected acquisitions of defensible technologies accompanied with visionary management teams who can demonstrate a common goal with us in order to unlock the full potential with capital infusion, accelerate growth. To achieve our development plans, we plan to incubate those acquired companies toward foreseeable plans for mergers and acquisitions, formation of global joint ventures, while facilitating new market entry to today’s fastest growing Southeast Asia region. With this acquisition model, we expect to build a valuable technology portfolio of IP assets in various innovative green energy technologies, leveraging our network of global capital partners with low-cost manufacturing capacity and oversea outsourcing technical talents from our niche sources in Vietnam.
 

We plan to execute a “Dual Growth Business Model” as depicted in the diagram below encompassing (1) IP portfolio growth which includes technology licensing or technology acquisitions, enhanced with our plans to carry out research and development for specific applications, and (2) sustainable revenue growth by executing planned BESS acquisitions via joint ventures with capital partners to collect joint venture income from BESS operations or Vietnam-based manufacturing partners which can manufacture products derived from our technology solutions.

In light of these initiatives and other reasons noted below, the Company has, however, elected to discontinue its efforts to commercialize the electric power generation and charging system (the “Tesdison Technology”) it formerly licensed from SuperGreen Energy Corporation (“SuperGreen”) pursuant to the Patent & Technology Exclusive and Non-Exclusive License Agreement dated January 15, 2021, as amended, entered into between SuperGreen and the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Bitech Mining Corporation (“Bitech Mining”) (the “SuperGreen License”). The Company has determined that the Tesdison Technology was not functional nor was it capable of being developed into a commercially viable product as had been represented to the Company by SuperGreen, its founder Calvin Cao, and his brother Michael Cao, leading up to Bitech Mining entering into the SuperGreen License. In addition, the Company will temporarily pause the further development of Intellisys-8, the Company’s planned chipset and related software that had been designed to reduce power consumption and heat in computer systems and accelerate their computational speed due to the currently unfavorable market conditions within the cryptocurrency market.
 
Acquisition of Bitech Mining Corporation
 
The Company acquired Bitech Mining on March 31, 2022 (the “Closing Date”) through a share exchange pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) by and among the Company, Bitech Mining, each of Bitech Mining’s shareholders (each, a “Seller” and collectively, the “Sellers”), and Benjamin Tran, solely in his capacity as Sellers’ Representative (“Sellers’ Representative”). The transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement is hereinafter referred to as the “Share Exchange”). The Share Exchange Agreement provides that the Company will acquire from the Sellers, an aggregate of 94,312,250 shares of Bitech Mining’s Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Bitech Mining (collectively, the “Bitech Mining Shares”). In consideration of the Bitech Mining Shares, the Company issued to the Sellers an aggregate of 9,000,000 shares of the Company’s newly authorized Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). Each Bitech Mining Share shall be entitled to receive 0.09543 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into 53.975685 shares (an aggregate of approximately 485,781,300) of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Company Common Stock”) upon filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company’s authorized common stock so that there are a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized but unissued to permit a full conversion of all the Series A Preferred Stock. Effective as of June 27, 2022, the Series A Preferred Stock automatically converted into 485,781,168 shares of Company Common Stock following the June 27, 2022 filing of an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of the Company’s authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000 shares. Upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Sellers held, in the aggregate, approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock on a fully diluted basis.
 
The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization and reverse acquisition for financial reporting purposes, and Bitech Mining is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in our business and operations, a discussion of the past financial results of our predecessor, Spine Injury Solutions Inc., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles, the historical financial results of Bitech Mining, the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered our historical financial results.
