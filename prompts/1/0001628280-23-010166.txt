Solutions and Services
BigBear.ai is a leader in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for decision support. We provide our customers with a competitive advantage in a world driven by data that is growing exponentially in terms of volume, variety, and velocity. We believe data—when leveraged effectively—can be a strategic asset for any organization. 
Through our supply chain & logistics, autonomous systems and cybersecurity solutions, we help our customers make sense of the world in which they operate, understand how known and previously unforeseen forces impact their operations, and determine which decision and course of action will best achieve their objectives. With all of our solutions, as needed by each customer, we offer specialized consulting services to design, customize, deploy, operate, and support our solutions for federal and commercial customers. Due to the breadth and depth of experience and expertise in our team, many of our customers rely on BigBear.ai resources to supplement their technical and operational staff for long-term engagements as well.
Supply Chains & Logistics Solutions
Our supply chain & logistics solutions include our Observe Data-as-a-Service (“DaaS”) solution, our ProModel discrete event simulator and our Dominate forecasting tool. 
Observe DaaS—Data Conflation at Scale. Observe is a near-real time data collection and curation tool designed to collect and process enormous volumes of data from multiple domains, including BigBear.ai data collections, customer proprietary data, and third-party data, to create more holistic insights. Observe captures and distills data to identify relevant information, forming a more coherent and continuously updated view of the situations that matter to our customers anywhere across the globe. Our collections cover many subjects, including facilities, locations, news, events, social media, public communications, internet services and more. For situations that require a more customized solution, Observe collections can be used to enrich the customer’s proprietary data and analytics via modern, robust application programming interfaces (APIs). Our Observe DaaS solution is live in production, with over 25 sources, across more than 100 countries, and 140 million records processed daily. 
ProModel Discrete Event Simulator—Course of Action Analysis & Digital Twin. ProModel is a robust discrete-event simulation technology that captures the behavior of complex interdependent processes and enables rapid course-of-action analysis through a “what if” user interface that allows customers to alter various parameters without changing the model directly. The ProModel 
digital twin modeling platform is used to plan, design and improve new or existing manufacturing, logistics, business processes and other operational systems, and has been implemented in multiple vertical use cases including shipyard planning (Shipyard AI), patient flow optimization in hospitals (Future Flow) and complex portfolio management (Enterprise Portfolio Simulator). Because our Discrete Event Simulator is built and deployed as foundational technology, it can be tailored to many use cases for customers based on specific needs and embedded in existing platforms for an optimal user experience.
Dominate—Macroeconomic & Geopolitical Forecasting. Dominate is a decision support engine that provides customers goal-oriented advice to help them determine the right decision or course of action to best achieve their desired results. Using technology derived from our battlefield expertise, Dominate forecasts future outcomes based on different decision options, assigns a likelihood to each of those outcomes, and allows users to understand potential impacts for each of these decision options. Dominate is based on a resilient analytical architecture specifically designed to make sense of data sets that are periodically dirty, erroneous, or full of gaps. Customers can easily manipulate constraints or modify outcome goals through an interactive interface to quickly reveal the impacts of different decisions. Even in complex environments, Dominate helps customers reveal unexpected insights and develop innovative courses of action.
Cybersecurity Solutions
“BEARCLAW”—AI-Powered, Machine Accelerated Binary Analysis and SpaceCREST—Vulnerability Assessment & Monitoring, Digital Twin. Our cybersecurity offerings include our Binary Extraction Analysis Repository / Customizable Logic Automated Workflow (“BEARCLAW”) engine and the Space Cyber Resiliency through Evaluation and Security Testing (“SpaceCREST”) laboratory environment. Our BEARCLAW engine is a modular framework that incorporates AI/ML to assess vulnerabilities using automation and our data collections to conduct analysis on binaries and better, more quickly inform analysts to help them rapidly identify and/or respond to threats. 
SpaceCREST is a laboratory environment designed to study and evaluate vulnerabilities of space assets in a cyber-physical system, develop cyber resiliency, and provide situational awareness and monitoring of those assets. The SpaceCREST initiative leverages Redwire Corporation’s digital engineering ecosystem, including its Hyperion Operational Space Simulation (“HOSS”) Lab and Advanced Configurable Open-system Research Network (“ACORN”) capabilities. Using HOSS and the ACORN platform, BigBear.ai develops tools and technologies to perform vulnerability research on space infrastructure hardware components, identify potential vulnerabilities that could compromise space systems, and provide tools and techniques that demonstrate how to mitigate and protect against the potential vulnerabilities identified. SpaceCREST’s digital twin helps operators rapidly identify when an attack or system failure is occurring. SpaceCREST also performs catastrophic testing without physically destroying the space asset or interrupting operations and our team of specialists then develops cyber security to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks for our customers. 
Our specialists also provide ongoing offensive and defensive cybersecurity analysis services to certain key customers and our mission operators often partner with government teams to contribute to missions for the intelligence community and the Department of Defense (the “DoD”). 
Autonomous Systems Solutions
We are well positioned to address the need for scaled cyber-physical systems for complex customers in the federal government, and in the future, the private sector. Our autonomous systems solutions currently in use by the DoD provide geospatial tracking, anomaly detection, computer vision capabilities, and AI at the edge. By conflating millions of data points using AI/ML, our autonomous systems benefit from increased situational awareness, enable predictive forecasts, and can alert both analysts and decision-makers of potential threats. Analysts can combine data sets, including traditional and nontraditional sources, including social media, traditional news media and event data (e.g., GDELT), SIGINT (e.g., X-band, Lband, AIS), SAR, weather and enterprise data sources, to improve situational awareness. Currently, our algorithms run against a myriad of sensors in a maritime environment to support forces who may be operating in disadvantaged or disconnected environments. We believe that this can be leveraged in ground, space, and air combat force contexts in the future.
Research & Development
Our team has more than 20 years of combined experience developing and deploying software products. Historically, much of our research and development has been funded and directed by defense and intelligence customers for their specific needs and objectives. In 2022, we increased hiring and headcount in our innovations lab as well as investment in various research projects aimed at continuing to develop and refine our solutions, including enhancing features and functionality, adding new modules, and improving the application of the latest AI/ML technologies in the solutions we deliver to our customers.
One area of our research and development efforts has focused on contributing to the Joint All-Domain Command and Control (“JADC2”)—the DoD’s strategy to connect sensors globally from all branches of the armed forces into a unified network, powered by AI. JADC2 is one of the Pentagon’s top priorities, and we are aiming to play a major role in the realization of this concept by delivering the operating system for its delivery.
Customers
BigBear.ai’s customers include U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, manufacturing, distribution and logistics, healthcare and life sciences. To date, BigBear.ai has predominantly served federal, military, and intelligence agencies of the U.S. government. We are proud of the trusted, multi-decade relationships we have with several U.S. defense and intelligence agencies, including the Joint Staff, U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). These customers entrust us with their most critical data and operations and represent most of our historical growth.
Our capabilities are also used extensively by the private sector, with hundreds of complex manufacturing, retail, and logistics clients. Our process simulation and modeling solutions help companies manage massive and complex physical and information environments and gain clarity on facility, equipment and personnel systems, forecasting requirements, and simulating real-world situations. 
We are continuing to grow our customer base in our three markets: supply chains & logistics, cybersecurity, and autonomous systems. This is a focus area for us in 2023 as we find ways to apply our existing technology to new use cases and meet growing customer demand. As new use cases are onboarded, we expand our capabilities by adding new data sources, analysis tools, and integrated services to our platform to support new industries and decision scenarios. Thus, every new engagement expands our capability baseline and opens the door to a pipeline of new opportunities within that market and within adjacent markets.
Revenue Mix
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from contracts with the federal government and government agencies. Due to the sensitive and oftentimes classified nature of our work with these customers, a significant portion of BigBear.ai’s contracts still require our data scientists and software engineers to co-locate on-premises to tailor our solutions for these unique environments and use cases. However, as we have continued to amass knowledge and intellectual property (“IP”), our proprietary products now require less customization, and our pipeline has begun to reflect our customers’ desire to more rapidly integrate our capabilities into their current operating environments.
Competitive Advantage
BigBear.ai’s principle competitive advantage is that we are an organization built on a culture of recruiting and retaining talent that we believe attracts the brightest talent in the industry. BigBear.ai is made up of hundreds of employees with domain expertise and hands-on experience in the environments that we build and deliver solutions for. We are focused on creating technology that solves real customer problems, and our team is a critical part of understanding the challenges our customers face.
Additionally, BigBear.ai has been a trusted partner to federal, military, and intelligence agencies of the U.S. government for decades—we take that trust seriously and we work every day to keep it. Because of our history in complex systems integration and AI orchestration, we are well positioned to support the current wave of excitement regarding artificial intelligence, as key decision makers and leaders across government and industry are recognizing the necessity of at-scale, production-grade augmented decision intelligence. Specifically, we believe we are well positioned because of our team’s ability to deploy innovative solutions quickly, offering our customer’s competitive pricing and robust support while leveraging our track record of success in complex environments.

Competition
Our competitors include software companies that develop horizontal solutions in the supply chain & logistics, cybersecurity and autonomous systems markets, as well as vertically focused analytics tools within our target markets. We also face competition from government contractors and system integrators who are building custom solutions to enter this market. In many cases, we are competing with the internal software development efforts of our potential customers. Organizations frequently attempt to build their own decision support and analytics platforms using a patchwork of custom development, outside consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and significant internal IT resources, before turning to BigBear.ai.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include:
•platform agility and product functionality
•data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance
•ease and speed of adoption, use, and deployment
•product innovation and roadmap
•pricing and cost structures
•customer experience, including technical support and education
•brand awareness and reputation
•track record of success in complex environments
While we compete favorably on these factors, some of our competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, broader customer bases, larger sales and marketing budgets, more technology, channel, and distribution partners, wider geographic presence, greater focus in specific vertical markets, lower labor and research and development costs, larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide support, make acquisitions, and develop and introduce new products.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonality in the timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the timing of the execution of our contracts, as we have historically executed many of our contracts in the third and fourth quarters due to the fiscal year ends and procurement cycles of our customers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our sales efforts involve considerable time and expense and our sales cycle is often long and unpredictable” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our results of operations and our key business measures are likely to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis in future periods and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations.” Additionally, recurring delays in the federal government’s budgeting process can adversely affect the award of new contracts or growth on existing contracts during continuing resolutions.
Regulatory
Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods.
For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, contractual provisions, and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights.
We seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business through patent protection in the United States and abroad; however, we are not dependent on any particular patent or application for the operation of our business. In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into proprietary information and invention assignment agreements or similar agreements with our employees, consultants, and contractors. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights through provisions in our agreements with customers.
Legal Proceedings
We are subject to litigation, claims, investigations and audits arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Although legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to any matters currently pending against us and we intend to vigorously defend against such matters. The outcome of these matters, individually and in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital
Our employees are critical to the success of our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 649 full-time employees, substantially all of which are employed in the United States. We also engage part-time employees, independent contractors, and third-party personnel to supplement our workforce.
None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages due to employee disputes, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
Our human capital resources objectives include recruiting, retaining, training, and motivating our personnel. The principal purposes of our incentive compensation policies are to attract, retain, and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their ability and achieve our objectives. We strive to foster a diverse and inclusive culture and environment that encourages active dialogue and robust engagement on the issues most salient to employee satisfaction and believe our employees are empowered to play a significant role in shaping the direction and success of the company.
