Company Overview



We are a clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California, focused on the development of therapeutics for unmet medical needs in chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis by employing innovative research, and, where appropriate, combination therapy. Our Company was founded by several world-leading scientists in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. Our world-renowned scientists Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann, Prof. Lawrence Steinman, Prof. Raphael Mechoulam, recently deceased, Dr. Jonathan Rothbard, and Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal have significant experience and significant previous success in drug discovery. The scientists are from the University of Oxford (“Oxford”), Stanford University and Hebrew University of Jerusalem (the “Hebrew University”), and the management team has extensive experience in financing and growing early-stage healthcare companies. Prof. Raphael Mechoulam passed away in March 2023, but his research at Hebrew University is being carried on by other scientists as noted later in this document under the “SCAs Platform” section.



We have three different product development platforms that are focused on different diseases or medical conditions, and that target different factors, molecules or proteins, as follows:




● | Anti-TNF platform: focusing on fibrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor (“anti-TNF”);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SCAs platform: focusing on drugs which are synthetic cannabidiol (“CBD”) or cannabigerol (“CBG”) analogues (“SCAs”); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | α7nAChR platform: focusing on alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (“α7nAChR”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our lead product candidate recently completed Phase 2a and Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trials in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and the Netherlands for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture, a condition that affects the development of fibrous connective tissue in the palm of the hand. Currently, we are planning or conducting clinical trials only for certain indications under the anti-TNF platform, such as a planned Phase 2 trial for post-operative cognitive decline as well as a planned Phase 2 trial for frozen shoulder. The Company was recruiting patients for a feasibility trial for frozen shoulder, for which we have ended such recruitment at nine patients, due to a regulatory request in the UK to end slow recruiting trials. The result of the closure of the trial means that another trial will likely need to be undertaken in the future to recruit additional participants. Of our three product development platforms, only one, the SCAs platform, involves products that are related to cannabidiol (CBD) (and not to cannabis or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)), and no clinical trials for indications or products under the SCAs platform are currently being conducted in the United States or abroad. We are currently undertaking preclinical research and development activities for the SCA and the α7nAChR platforms.



Business Strategy



Our goal is to capitalize on our research in chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis by pursuing the following strategies:




● | advance our clinical-stage product candidate for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture from its current late-stage development to seek and obtain approval in the U.K., European Union (“EU”) and the United States (“U.S.”) for such product candidate, potentially commercialize the product candidate in the U.K., EU and U.S. and identify the optimal commercial pathway in other markets around the world; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | move our pre-clinical product candidates into clinical trials, seek and obtain approval in the U.K., EU and U.S. for such future product candidates, and potentially commercialize such future product candidates in the U.S., U.K. and EU; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | leverage our proprietary product development platforms to discover, develop and commercialize novel first-in-class products for the treatment of chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strengthen our position in research in chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis.

Overview of Product Development Platforms



The following chart summarizes the products and indications, including those currently in clinical trial, for our three product development platforms.






“*Regulatory approvals obtained from the MHRA and CCMO and the relevant accredited ethics committees to perform clinical trials in the U.K. and The Netherlands. No marketing applications or requests for marketing approval have been submitted to the FDA for any products at this time.”



On December 1, 2021, the Company announced positive top line data for the Phase 2b clinical trial of Dupuytren’s Contracture.



On February 22, 2023, the Company announced the closure of recruitment of patients for the feasibility trial for frozen shoulder, for which we have ended such recruitment at nine patients, due to a regulatory request in the UK to end slow recruiting trials. The result of the closure of the trial means that another trial will likely need to be undertaken in the future to recruit additional participants.



The product development platforms are each described in more detail below.



Fibrosis & Anti-TNF Platform



Our anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) platform began at our wholly-owned subsidiary, 180 Therapeutics L.P. (“180 LP”). This platform is focused on studying the molecular mechanism of inflammatory diseases and fibrosis and on the discovery of TNF as a mediator of fibrosis, as well as other immune-driven diseases. This research was first undertaken in the 1980s by our Co-Chairman, Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann, based on analysis of tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). We are applying this same approach to the analysis of human disease tissue from patients with active fibrosis, research led by Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal in Oxford (who is also the Chairman of our Clinical Advisory Board), which has led to the identification of new therapeutic targets and approaches that we are developing. Profs. Nanchahal and Feldmann, in collaboration with other scientists, are leveraging their experience and expertise in developing anti-inflammatories to search for new applications for anti-TNF therapeutics. We are seeking to demonstrate that anti-TNF drugs, such as adalimumab, have a positive effect on new indications such as Dupuytren’s Contracture, frozen shoulder and post-operative cognitive dysfunction/delirium (“POCD”).











Our first product candidate in clinical development is for the potential treatment of early-stage fibrosis of the hand, Dupuytren’s Contracture, for which there is currently no approved treatment in the U.K. or EU. Collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum has been approved in the USA for late-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture. The proposed treatment will be administered by a local injection of adalimumab, an anti-TNF antibody, into early-stage disease tissue. The results for the Phase 2a clinical trial for Dupuytren’s Contracture, supported by the Wellcome Trust, U.K. Department of Health and the Company, were published in July 2018. The study demonstrated positive tissue response indicative of anti-fibrotic mechanisms, as well as guiding dosing for follow up trials. Having defined the most efficacious dose and preparation and based on these positive proof of concept data, the Company, together with the Wellcome Trust and the U.K. Department of Health, initiated a Phase 2b trial in patients with early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture. The initial plan was to randomize 138 patients in a ratio of 1:1 to receive four injections of adalimumab or placebo at three-month intervals and followed for a total of 18 months from baseline. With additional funding from the Wellcome Trust, the Phase 2b trial completed recruitment of 174 patients in April 2019, having commenced dosing in February 2017. The final patient was enrolled in April 2019. The Phase 2b clinical trial for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture has been completed. On December 1, 2021, the Company announced top line data from the trial, which indicates that the primary end point of nodule hardness and the secondary end point of nodule size on ultrasound scan were met with statistically significant differences. There were no related severe adverse events. The full results have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and will be disclosed upon publication. Through this fibrosis and anti-TNF product development platform, we are also performing research for the development of potential treatments of frozen shoulder, liver and lung fibrosis and POCD.



The following chart summarizes the timing of current and future clinical trials, based on current proposals, under the anti-TNF platform.







We have obtained regulatory approvals from the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Dutch Centrale Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek (CCMO), as well as from the relevant accredited ethics committees, in order to perform clinical trials in the U.K. and The Netherlands solely for indications under the anti-TNF platform. No marketing applications or requests for marketing approval have been submitted to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any indications or products under the anti-TNF platform at this time. On March 29, 2022 we submitted a request to FDA for a Type C Meeting to discuss clinical outcome assessment in clinical trials of the anti-TNF platform for early stage Dupuytren’s disease. On April 26, 2022, FDA granted the meeting request and agreed to provide written responses in lieu of a meeting. On June 9, 2022, FDA provided the aforementioned written responses in which the agency questioned whether nodule hardness and size would constitute an appropriate end point in such studies. Specifically, FDA stated, “The proposed outcome measures of nodule hardness and nodule size do not appear to be clinical outcome measures that measure how a patient feel, functions, or survives, which would be needed to support a demonstration of efficacy in your future registrational studies.”



On February 22, 2023, the Company announced the closure of recruitment of patients for the feasibility trial for frozen shoulder, for which we have ended such recruitment at nine patients, due to a regulatory request in the UK to end slow recruiting trials. The result of the closure of the trial means that another trial will likely need to be undertaken in the future to recruit additional participants.



HMGB1 Program



Our HMGB1 program was formed with the in-licensing of the technology from the University of Oxford on November 2, 2021. Our HMGB1 program falls under the Fibrosis and Anti-TNF Platform. We have identified HMGB1 as a therapeutic target that acts on multiple endogenous adult stem cells to accelerate the physiological regenerative response to current or future injuries. These findings have broad relevance to the fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine and suggest a therapeutic approach to promote tissue repair such as in NASH liver regeneration.











The technology was developed by Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal’s laboratory at the University Oxford prior to licensing. Due to the early stage of development of HMGB1, we are still in the process of assessing milestones and development timelines. The licensing of HMGB1 included the lead development candidate for liver fibrosis. Our HMGB1 program continues to advance slowly. The molecular dynamics for the binding of this molecule are extremely complex and potentially need more extensive research in order to identify a lead candidate.



No regulatory approvals have been sought or obtained from appropriate authorities at this time for any products or indications under the HMGB1 platform.



SCAs Platform



Our SCAs platform began at our wholly-owned subsidiary, CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“CBR Pharma”) with the collaborative work of its founders Prof. Mechoulam, deceased, and Prof. Feldmann. This platform focuses on the development of synthetic pharmaceutical grade molecules close or distant analogs of non-psychoactive cannabinoids such as CBD for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain. These development efforts are a result of a 20-year collaboration between Prof. Feldmann, who discovered and commercialized anti-TNF therapy for treatment of RA and subsequently a number of inflammatory diseases, which is currently the best-selling drug class in the world, and Prof. Mechoulam, who was a world leading expert in cannabis chemistry who successfully identified THC, CBD and, subsequently, the endocannabinoids. We are working with a research team based at the Kennedy Institute at Oxford, consisting of Prof. Feldmann, Prof. Richard Williams and others, and a research team based at Hebrew University, consisting of Prof. Avi Domb, Prof. Amnon Hoffman and others, to generate new drugs, test them, and optimize their uptake and delivery to disease targets. The aim is to develop novel, orally active analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications based on synthetic compounds to target chronic diseases. We term these synthetic compounds generically as “synthetic CBD analogs” (“SCAs”). Our primary development targets are arthritis and chronic and recurrent pain, while our secondary development targets are diabetes/diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, obesity and fatty liver disease.



No regulatory approvals have been sought or obtained from appropriate authorities at this time for any products or indications under the SCAs platform.



α7nAChR Platform



Our α7nAChR platform began at our wholly-owned subsidiary, Katexco, where its founders identified α7nAChR as a key receptor for the amyloid proteins associated with diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. α7nAChR is expressed on the surface of both neuronal cells in the brain and on important cells of the immune system. The research conducted by Dr. Jonathan Rothbard and Prof. Steinman has shown that small molecules available as drugs taken by mouth can engage this receptor and potentially reduce inflammatory diseases. Dr. Rothbard and Prof. Steinman have also shown that α7nAChR is critical in reducing disease animal models of multiple sclerosis and RA, as well as heart attack and stroke. Our α7nAChR product development platform is currently focused on developing α7nAChR agonists for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, initially ulcerative colitis induced after cessation of smoking.



No regulatory approvals have been sought or obtained from appropriate authorities at this time for any products or indications under the α7nAChR platform.



Product Candidates



We are attempting to build a broad and diverse pipeline of product candidates in chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis. Our product candidates are and will be selected for development based on: potential to address unmet medical needs; development feasibility as determined by our preclinical research and development efforts; potential to rapidly achieve proof-of-concept based on easy-to-measure validated regulatory endpoints; and significant commercial potential.
Anti-TNF Platform Dupuytren’s Contracture



Overview



Dupuytren’s Contracture, also referred to as hand fibrosis, is a progressive, incurable disease characterized by the development of fibrous cords in the palm of the hand, commonly affecting the ring and/or small finger and often multiple joints, leading to contracture and the inability to straighten the affected fingers. Symptoms, when presented to a physician, range from the appearance of nodules in the palm, which can be painless or painful and often disconcerting to the patient, to the loss of the use of the contracted finger. There are currently no approved treatment options for those patients who present with symptomatic, early-stage disease.



Surgery remains the standard treatment for patients with Dupuytren’s Contractures but is associated with extended recovery periods and risks of recurrence.



We are developing therapies by repurposing of the anti-TNF therapeutic adalimumab, previously approved and used under the brand name Humira for several autoimmune conditions, for the treatment of early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture. Research at Oxford University has indicated an anti-TNF mechanism can slow or prevent the proliferation of myoblast cells that lead to the formation and growth of the fibrous nodules/cords in the palm and possible finger contracture. We have advanced the development program through Phase 2b clinical trials to evaluate the impact of multiple, intralesional injections on disease progression and functional improvement.



Dupuytren’s patients who have advanced disease are primarily treated by orthopedic or plastic surgeons, who rely on invasive interventions when the contracture impacts hand function. Current treatment options include open surgeries (fasciotomies or fasciectomies) and the less invasive procedures of needle aponeurotomy (NA) or collagenase injections. The less invasive procedures are designed to disrupt the integrity of a contracted cord so the fingers can be straightened. Unfortunately, these options are associated with a high rate of recurrence. Dissatisfaction within the medical and Dupuytren patient community with outcomes for later-stage disease and the lack of options to intervene at an early/pre-contracture stage indicate there is an unmet medical need for early-stage intervention.



According to the Dupuytren’s Foundation, Dupuytren’s Contracture prevalence is estimated to be up to 7% of the U.S. population. Based on the Foundation’s estimates, approximately three million patients have contractures that should be treated but only 10% to 20% of those patients are treated. Reasons for the lack of treatment may include the type of available interventions, poor long-term outcomes, and reimbursement hurdles.



In primary interviews in late 2021 with 8 orthopedic/plastic surgeons, conducted by Red Sky Partners (an independent third-party consulting firm) on our behalf and designed to better understand the unmet need for patients with Dupuytren’s Contracture, revealed a strong desire among hand surgeons and patients to treat this condition early, before the development of late stage contractures, in a non-invasive manner that will limit further progression, preserve function and prevent or delay invasive surgery. Surgeons’ reactions to the rationale for the use of adalimumab to address this unmet need were overall positive and the mechanistic concept of an anti-TNF compound was considered compelling. In the view of the majority of surveyed hand surgeons, the non-invasive, safe product profile would potentially position adalimumab as an important therapeutic option for a much wider range of patients than are typically treated today. Assuming clinical efficacy and safety are supported with published data, we believe that adalimumab would become an attractive alternative to surgery, needle aponeurotomy or collagenase. Further, we believe it has potential use in many early-stage patients who are not treated today.



Based on both primary (feedback from these physician interviews) and secondary research, Red Sky Partners concluded that an initial label focused on patients with a clear contracture where adalimumab would soften nodules and limit progression would be highly differentiated from current therapies and could generate revenues in the range of $300 million to $350 million annually in the U.S. More significantly, the opportunity to offer a safe, non-invasive therapeutic leading to improved function could dramatically expand the treatable population as more patients seek treatment and more physicians are motivated to offer their patients an alternative to waiting to see if their disease progresses, which they cannot do today. This product positioning could generate a revenue opportunity two to three times the initial market opportunity.



Phase 2 Clinical Trials



Our wholly-owned subsidiary, 180 LP, contributed to the funding of a Phase 2a clinical trial for Dupuytren’s Contracture along with the Wellcome Trust and the U.K. Department of Health, which using an experimental medicine clinical trial design demonstrated positive tissue response, as well as guiding dosing and tolerability for follow-up trials. The data was published in June 2018.











For the Phase 2a trial, we recruited 28 patients, eight assigned to the 15 milligrams (mg), 12 to the 35 mg and eight to the 40 mg adalimumab cohorts. There was no change in mRNA levels for ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1 and CDH11. Levels of α-SMA protein expression in patients treated with 40 mg adalimumab (1.09 ± 0.09 ng per μg of total protein) were significantly lower (p = 0.006) compared to placebo treated patients (1.51 ± 0.09 ng/μg). The levels of procollagen type I protein expression were also significantly lower (p = 0.019) in the subgroup treated with 40 mg adalimumab (474 ± 84 pg/μg total protein) compared with placebo (817 ± 78 pg/μg). There were two serious adverse events, both considered unrelated to the study drug. In this dose-ranging study, injection of 40 mg of adalimumab in 0.4 ml resulted in down regulation of the myofibroblast phenotype as evidenced by reduction in expression of α-SMA and type I procollagen proteins at 2 weeks.



Having defined the most efficacious dose and preparation and based on these positive proof-of-concept data, the Company, together with the Wellcome Trust and the U.K. Department of Health, initiated a Phase 2b trial in patients with early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture. The initial plan was to randomize 138 patients in a ratio of 1:1 to receive four injections of adalimumab or placebo at three-month intervals and followed for a total of 18 months from baseline. The Phase 2b trial, which was funded by grants from the Wellcome Trust and the U.K. Department of Health, with a contribution from 180 LP to purchase the drug, completed recruitment of 174 patients in April 2019 and commenced dosing in February 2017 in the U.K. and Groningen, The Netherlands.



The Phase 2b clinical trial for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture has been completed. On December 1, 2021, the Company announced top line data from the trial, which indicates that the primary end point of nodule hardness and the secondary end point of nodule size on ultrasound scan were met with statistically significant differences. There were no related severe adverse events. The full results have been published in the Lancet Rheumatology publication on April 29, 2022.



Other Product Candidates or Indications



In addition to the potential treatment, we are developing for Dupuytren’s Contracture described above, we are seeking to repurpose anti-TNF for use as a treatment for other fibrotic conditions such as frozen shoulder. Prof. Feldmann’s previous work in the 1980’s demonstrated that anti-TNF is an effective anti-inflammatory with many possible uses, and it was subsequently approved for various forms of inflammatory arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as other indications. This has since created what is currently the best-selling drug class in the world, anti-TNF therapeutics, which, according to a Research Reports World report published on November 3, 2022, was valued at $42.7 billion in 2022. By using a well-known and extensively used therapeutic, adalimumab, the research and development process may be truncated because of existing product information relating to safety, as the drug has been widely used over the past 20 years in millions of patients.
Frozen Shoulder



Frozen shoulder, also referred to as adhesive capsulitis, is an extremely painful and debilitating condition that affects an individual’s everyday activities, including sleep. According to the National Institute of Health, frozen shoulder is most common in people between the ages of 40 and 60. It is estimated that 2 to 5% of the population are affected by frozen shoulder at some point, and it is somewhat more common in women than in men. People with diabetes are particularly likely to develop a frozen shoulder: About 10 to 20% of them get it, but it is not yet known why this happens. In addition, approximately 20% of people suffering from a frozen shoulder will develop the same problem in their other shoulder. According to an article published in Shoulder & Elbow in 2010, it is estimated that up to 30% of patients with diabetes develop frozen shoulder, and the symptoms tend to be more persistent and recalcitrant in this group.



During the pain predominant inflammatory phase, patients are typically treated with analgesics, physiotherapy and corticosteroid injections. Patients with persistent stiffness may be referred to secondary care for capsular release by manipulation under anesthesia, hydrodilatation or surgical arthroscopy. To our knowledge, there is currently no approved targeted therapy, and in conjunction with the National Institute for Health Research (U.K.), we are investigating the feasibility of recruiting patients during the early pain-predominant inflammatory phase of the disease and delivery of a local injection of anti-TNF. The set-up stage for this Phase 2 clinical trial for the local injection of anti-TNF for frozen shoulder started in June 2021. A £250,000 grant has been awarded from NIHR to the University of Oxford to support execution and clinical trial sites are being identified. The Company is providing additional funding to support this trial. The recruitment of men and women across England with early-stage Frozen shoulder for a trial to determine the feasibility of conducting a large randomized controlled trial to assess whether an intra-articular injection of anti-TNF (Adalimumab) can reduce pain and improve function in people with pain predominant early-stage frozen shoulder, which was called the Anti-Freaze-F trial, began in May 2022. The Anti-Freaze-F trial was being run by the University of Oxford and originally sought to recruit 84 participants. Following delays in gaining approvals due to backlogs in the NIHR system due to COVID-19 and consequential staff vacancies, nine participants were recruited for participation in the trial through mid-February 2023. Subsequently, the NIHR’s Research Recovery and Reset program identified the trial as slow moving, due to the considerable challenges we faced to open recruitment sites and enroll sufficient participants during COVID-19. Therefore, the NIHR asked the chief investigators to close the trial for further recruitment. The participants enrolled to date will receive their injections and follow up according to the established protocol. The Company had previously requested a no-cost extension, which was denied. The result of the closure of the trial means that another trial will likely need to be undertaken at a future time to recruit additional participants.










Human Liver Fibrosis



Fibrosis of the liver is characterized by long-term damage to the organ caused by the replacement of normal liver tissue with scar tissue. The condition is most commonly caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), which encompasses non-alcoholic fatty liver (“NFL”) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”). NAFLD affects approximately 30% of the U.S. population, according to an article published in Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology in 2016. Approximately 2% of patients with NFL and approximately 15% to 20% of patients with NASH progress to cirrhosis, fibrosis of the liver with major health issues.



To our knowledge, there is no current approved treatment for individuals with NASH. We therefore believe that there is a large potential market for the creation of an effective preventative treatment. According to Allied Market Research, the market for treating liver fibrosis was approximately $13 billion in 2018 and is projected to rise to approximately $20 billion in 2022, rising at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 11% per year. We initiated preclinical studies for NASH based on human liver samples during the second quarter of 2020.



Post-operative Cognitive Decline (POCD)



POCD is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome, defined as disturbance of attention, awareness and cognition, which develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day. Patients with hip fracture are at particularly high risk of developing POCD. The U.K.’s national audit data for 2018 showed that 25% of all patients with hip fracture suffered from delirium. POCD is associated with poor functional outcomes, reduced quality of life and longer hospital stays. People with hip fracture who developed delirium are twice as likely to die as inpatients, and nearly four times more likely to need placement in a nursing home. POCD has also been closely associated with long-term cognitive impairment. 



Hip fractures are one of the main challenges facing elderly patients and healthcare systems. According to an article published in The Lancet Public Health in 2017, hip fractures are associated with an average loss of 2.7% of the healthy life expectancy in the middle-aged and older population in the U.S. and Europe. People suffering hip fracture have a mean age of 83 years, are frail, and two-thirds are women. They suffer a 30-day mortality of 7% and experience a persistent reduction in their health-related quality-of-life similar to that of a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis. According to various studies, POCD is developed in 13-40% of patients following cardiac surgery. With 500,000 open heart surgeries and 450,000 hip surgeries in the USA each year, in advanced age patients, a beneficial therapy to treat POCD would be a significant benefit to these patients. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study using anti-TNF for POCD and start patient recruitment during the second or third quarter of 2023. An issued patent to protect this potential use has been licensed from The Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research.



SCAs Platform



Overview



Cannabinoids are a class of compounds derived from cannabis plants. The two major cannabinoids contained in cannabis are CBD and THC. Although one cannabinoid, THC, is known to cause psychoactive effects associated with the use of herbal cannabis, no other cannabinoid is known to share these properties. In recent decades, there have been major scientific advances that have led to the discovery of new plant-derived cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system. There are at least two types of cannabinoid receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, cannabinoid receptor 1 (“CB1”) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (“CB2”). CB1 receptors are considered to be among the most widely expressed G protein-coupled receptors in the brain and are particularly abundant in areas of the brain concerned with movement and postural control, pain and sensory perception, memory, cognition, emotion, and autonomic and endocrine function. CB1 receptors are also found in peripheral tissues including peripheral nerves and non-neuronal tissues such as muscle, liver tissues and fat. CB2 receptors are expressed primarily in tissues in the immune system and are believed to mediate the immunological effects of cannabinoids. CBD does not interact with CB1 receptors and is only a weak agonist of CB2 receptors. CBD interacts with other important neurotransmitter and neuromodulatory systems in the human body, including transient receptor potential channels, adenosine uptake and serotonin receptors. The far-reaching and diverse pharmacology of the numerous cannabinoids provides significant potential for development of cannabinoid therapeutics across many indications and disease areas, but also adds to the complexity of the research.











For the SCA program, we have agreements in place with Hebrew University and Oxford, pursuant to which we intend to conduct research to develop and characterize novel SCAs for the treatment of certain target indications, and to perform early-phase clinical trials. Through the Research Agreements with Hebrew University and Oxford, we established research facilities at the Hebrew University and Oxford, in which the development and testing of new cannabinoids designed and synthesized at the Hebrew University will be facilitated. The labs at the Hebrew University will synthesize the chemical compounds and perform preliminary efficacy and safety studies.



Once these initial studies are completed at the Hebrew University, the chemical compounds are sent to Prof. Richard Williams at Oxford, where further evaluation is carried out to identify candidates which have the best potential for clinical efficacy and commercial development. Subsequently, we will support the clinical development of the lead compound(s), culminating in Phase 2 clinical trials to establish clinical utility in chronic pain and inflammatory indications.



The focus of the research is the development of safe and well-tolerated compounds with analgesic and immunomodulatory activity and with the capacity to synergize with current therapies, which target downstream inflammatory processes. After conducting initial research and development, we selected the most promising of the chemical derivatives to move into Phase 1/2 clinical trials, pending successful toxicity studies. In addition, we have identified two lead solid dosage oral formulations of CBD from animal studies, and preparations are underway to facilitate pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy human volunteers.



Product Candidates or Indications



We believe that there are unmet needs for orally available, relatively safe anti-inflammatory drugs, especially those with analgesic properties. We believe that SCAs have the potential to fulfill these needs and we have started to develop novel, orally available and patentable drug candidates to treat certain diseases or conditions such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, psoriasis, obesity and fatty liver, and various painful conditions. Our work on SCAs is currently in the preclinical development stage.



Because medical cannabis is a complex mixture of compounds from plants, providing a consistent level of the active compound of interest or controlling the level of the other natural compounds is difficult. Accordingly, we are working on orally available SCAs, not derived from plants, to address the deleterious issues of medical cannabis described above. If successful, these SCAs could become approved drug products that offer a robustly consistent and safe dosage that allows patient intake to be carefully controlled.



We believe that the development and clinical study of SCAs will reveal that SCAs have several key advantages over medical cannabis, including:




● | use of a pure compound (>99.5%) rather than a mixture of compounds; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to test and control dosing, which in turn controls efficacy and side effect levels; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | creation of a reproducible product; and 
--+--------------------------------------------


● | ability to engineer novel synthetic analogs to control binding preferences to select receptors, control agonist or antagonist effects of receptor binding (pharmacokinetics and dynamics), modify half-life of the drug in the body, and create pro-drug forms that are only activated in specified tissues, thereby potentially reducing off target side effects. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition to the above advantages, testing SCAs in scientific, double-blind clinical trials would help to allay physicians’ concerns regarding the therapeutic use of marijuana-based compounds. This change could increase the number of patients that have access to these drug therapies. If clinical trials are successful, there are a number of potential markets and indications for SCAs which we could target, which include individuals suffering from chronic and recurrent pain, diabetes, osteoarthritis, obesity and fatty liver disease.











α7nAChR Platform



Overview



Two of our lead scientists, Prof. Steinman and Dr. Rothbard, previously identified a key receptor for the amyloid proteins associated with diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, called α7nAChR. The α7nAChR is expressed on the surface of both neuronal cells in the brain and on cells of the immune system. The research conducted by Dr. Rothbard and Prof. Steinman has shown that small molecules available as drugs taken by mouth can engage this receptor and potently reduce inflammatory diseases. Dr. Rothbard and Prof. Steinman have shown that this receptor is critical in reducing disease in animal models of multiple sclerosis and RA, as well as heart attack and stroke.



Our efforts to understand the role of the high concentration of small heat shock proteins (“sHsp”) found in the lesions in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis led us to realize that the protein was (i) immune suppressive and (ii) therapeutic in animal 2 models of multiple sclerosis, cardiac and retinal ischemia, and stroke. A significant realization was that amyloid fibrils composed of proteins or small peptides exhibited biological responses equivalent to the sHsps. The fibrils and the sHsps specifically bound and activated macrophages (“MΦ”) and regulatory B cells. Crosslinking and precipitation experiments demonstrated that both species bound nAChR and signaled through Jak2/Stat3. We realized that nicotine treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (“EAE”) induces an identical pattern of immune suppression as our treatments and exhibits pre-clinical efficacy that is comparable with many of the drugs that are approved for multiple sclerosis (MS) when they were tested in EAE models. Collectively, these observations have informed our strategy to develop an orally available, small molecule agonist of α7nAChR for inflammation and autoimmune diseases.



The α7 subunit of α7nAChR is an integral part of an endogenous immune suppressive pathway, in which activation of the vagus nerve stimulates acetylcholine secretion, which in turn binds α7nAChR on MΦs and regulatory B lymphocytes. Activation of the MΦs initiates an immunosuppressive cascade of events that lead to reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppression of B and T cell activation and control of inflammation.



In autoimmune diseases like RA, where there is intense inflammation destroying joints, and in multiple sclerosis, where the brain is under attack with damage to vital neurologic circuits, the body’s immune system turns against its own tissues. Other diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to gout, also reveal manifestations of an unwanted autoimmune attack.



Activation of the α7nAChR results in a signaling cascade involving Jak2 and Stat3 leading to the conversion of the macrophages to an immune suppressive phenotype and the production of IL-10. IL-10 is known to reduce inflammatory cytokines, most prominently TNF, IL-1, and IL-6. Consequently, α7nAChR agonists should complement anti-TNF therapy, which opens up the possibility of developing a new class of orally available medicines which are anti-inflammatory but much safer than existing medications such as NSAIDS, Cox2 inhibitors, methotrexate, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. This is because α7nAChR agonists are activating an endogenous regulatory pathway, rather than blocking important pathways needed for diverse processes. The market opportunity arises from the complex and expensive effort by several large and small biotechnology companies in the development of a spectrum of orally available partial agonists specific for α7nAChR. The compounds underwent extensive preclinical assessment and were used in 18 studies comprising 2,670 subjects.











The drugs universally were shown to be safe, but ineffective in trials for neurologic and psychiatric diseases, namely Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. In randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, the compounds failed to meet their primary endpoint.



We plan to use these previous studies as a foundation to potentially develop a patentable α7nAChR analog within this family to use as an immune suppressive to treat a range of inflammatory and autoimmune indications including RA, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, gout and osteoarthritis. Our scientists have found that the α7 receptor on macrophages and regulatory B lymphocytes are different from the target of the drugs developed so far.



Product Candidates or Indications



We intend to identify, characterize, synthesize, and patent an orally available small molecular weight agonist of α7nAChR by screening non-patented analogs of large numbers of known agonists defined by pharmaceutical companies. We intend to outsource this work to Evotec GMBH, an integrated early discovery organization, and one which we have worked with in the past, specializing in ion channels and transporters, offering clients specialized technologies and scientific expertise to move from target to lead compounds.



Following a safety and efficacy assessment program, we intend to select candidates for pre-clinical development as a prelude to the potential initiation of clinical studies, which could potentially be followed by an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to the FDA. Our first intended target indication for its α7nAChR development platform is smoking cessation induced ulcerative colitis.



Outsourcing and Manufacturing



We are currently outsourcing our clinical trials, which are conducted at Oxford University, Edinburgh, U.K. and Groningen, The Netherlands and only involve certain indications under the anti-TNF platform. We expect to continue to outsource our clinical trials and conduct them at (1) in the case of the anti-TNF platform, Oxford University and Groningen, The Netherlands, (2) in the case of the SCAs platform, Hebrew University and Oxford University, and (3) in the case of the α7nAChR platform, to be determined.



We also expect to outsource all of our manufacturing activities, including those activities at the research or clinical stage, with SCAs to be produced at Hebrew University and α7nAChR to be produced by Evotec GMBH and the anti-TNF platform utilizing off-the-shelf adalimumab. In addition, we expect our products to be good manufacturing practice (GMP) grade and produced by accredited contract research organizations (CROs).



Material Agreements



We have entered into material research and licensing agreements (the “Research Agreements”) with various universities and parties in order to conduct research to develop potential product candidates. We have also entered into other material consulting and advisory services agreements with various scientists (the “Consulting Agreements”) to assist with such research.
Overview of Research Agreements



The Research Agreements include agreements with the Hebrew University and Oxford. For the anti-TNF platform, the Research Agreements with Oxford allow the Company to contribute financially to sponsor the research being conducted for the anti-TNF platform. In return, the Company will receive an exclusive option to license any intellectual property arising from the Research Agreements. There are also license agreements in place whereby we have exclusively licensed certain intellectual property from Oxford.



For the SCA program, we have agreements in place with Hebrew University and Oxford, pursuant to which we intend to conduct research to develop and characterize novel SCAs for the treatment of certain target indications, and to perform early-phase clinical trials. Through the Research Agreements with Hebrew University and Oxford, we established research facilities at the Hebrew University and Oxford, in which the development and testing of new cannabinoids designed and synthesized at the Hebrew University will be facilitated.











The Research Agreements are each described below.



Research Agreements with the Hebrew University



On May 13, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary CBR Pharma entered into a research and license agreement (the “2018 Hebrew Agreement”) with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Ltd.

The First Oxford Agreement is effective, unless earlier terminated, for so long as the specified patent application remains in effect as an issued patent, pending patent application or supplementary protection certificate or for a term of 20 years, whichever is longer.



On August 15, 2018, CannBioRex Pharma Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (“CannU.K.”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of our wholly-owned subsidiary CBR Pharma, entered into the Research Agreement (the “Second Oxford Agreement”) with Oxford, pursuant to which CBR Pharma (through CannU.K.) has sponsored Oxford’s research and development of SCAs developed from the Hebrew Licensed Technology. At Oxford, the SCAs generated in the Hebrew University are being tested for analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in established pre-clinical models.











Pursuant to the Second Oxford Agreement, Oxford undertook a research project (the “Research Project”) based around the clinical development of SCAs that are known to exhibit both anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The aim of the Research Project was to develop and characterize chemical compounds that are synthesized at Hebrew University to create treatments for chronic pain, RA and other chronic inflammatory conditions, and to eventually obtain regulatory approval to initiate early-phase clinical trials by mid to late 2022 or as soon as possible thereafter. The Second Oxford Agreement had an initial term of one year beginning on March 22, 2019, but was extended by amendment to March 31, 2020, or any later date agreed to by the parties, unless terminated earlier. The Second Oxford Agreement was not extended any further after March 31, 2020, and CannU.K.’s relationship with Oxford continued with additional agreements with Oxford, as described below.

Stanford License Agreement



On May 8, 2018, Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our wholly-owned subsidiary Katexco, entered into an option agreement (the “Stanford Option”) with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”), pursuant to which Stanford granted Katexco an option to acquire an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of certain inventions. In consideration for the Stanford Option, Katexco paid Stanford $10,000 (the “Option Payment”), creditable against the license issue fee agreement.



On July 25, 2018 (the “Stanford Effective Date”), Katexco exercised the Stanford Option, and entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Stanford License Agreement”) with Stanford, pursuant to which Katexco was granted the rights to certain U.S. patents related to (i) alpha B-crystallin as a therapy for autoimmune demyelination and (ii) peptides as short as six amino acids that form amyloid fibrils that activate B-1 cells and macrophages and are anti-inflammatory and therapeutic in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases (the “Stanford Licensed Patents”). Through the Stanford License Agreement, Katexco established research facilities at Stanford. We will support the clinical development of the lead compound(s), culminating in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials to establish potential clinical utility in ulcerative colitis indications.











Under the Stanford License Agreement, no rights of Stanford, including intellectual property rights, are granted to Katexco other than those rights granted under the Stanford Licensed Patents.



As consideration for the grant of the Stanford Licensed Patents, Katexco paid Stanford an initial fee of $50,000, inclusive of the Option Payment. The Company also issued 5,574 common shares to Stanford and provided a letter stating the value of such shares. A portion of the shares issued to Stanford were later distributed to five individuals, including our Chief Scientific Officer and co-chairman.



Beginning upon the first anniversary of the Stanford Effective Date and each anniversary thereafter, Katexco will pay Stanford an annual license maintenance fee of $20,000 on the first and second anniversaries and $40,000 on each subsequent anniversary. Furthermore, Katexco is obligated to make the following payments, including (i) $100,000 upon initiation of Phase 2 trial, (ii) $500,000 upon the first FDA approval of a product (the “Licensed Product”) resulting from the Stanford Licensed Patents, and (iii) $250,000 upon each new Licensed Product thereafter. Royalties, calculated at 2.5% of net sales (calculated as gross revenue received by Katexco or its sublicensees, their distributors or designees, from the sale, transfer or other disposition of products based on the Stanford Licensed Patents minus 5%), will be payable to Stanford. In addition, Katexco has reimbursed Stanford $51,385 to offset the Stanford Licensed Patent’s patenting expenses and will reimburse Stanford for all Stanford Licensed Patent’s patenting expenses, including any interference and or re-examination matters, incurred by Stanford after March 3, 2018.



We can terminate the Stanford License Agreement without cause by providing a 30-day notice. In the case of a change of control, upon the assignment of the Stanford License Agreement, Katexco is obligated to pay Stanford a $200,000 change of control fee. The Stanford License Agreement also provides Stanford with the right to purchase for cash up to either (i) 10% or (ii) the percentage necessary for Stanford to maintain its pro rata ownership interest in Katexco, of Katexco’s equity securities issued in a private offering. The shares issued to Stanford in connection with the Stanford License Agreement, gave Stanford and the five individuals who received a portion of the shares a total ownership of 2.11% in Katexco’s stock, prior to the July 2019, corporate restructuring completed between 180 and each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma, pursuant to which 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma became wholly-owned subsidiaries of 180LS (the “Reorganization”) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).



The Evotec Agreement



On June 7, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary Katexco entered into the Evotec Agreement with Evotec, a leading CRO, pursuant to which Evotec was retained to perform certain research services. Pursuant to the Evotec Agreement, the goal of the joint project (the “Evotec Project”) is to identify small molecules that pharmacologically stimulate the human ChrFam7a receptor and function. The Evotec Project is being conducted in two phases over a 24-month period where resources are allocated by the steering committee, which is controlled equally by the parties to the Evotec Agreement, on a quarterly basis.



Subject to certain exemptions described in the Evotec Agreement, Katexco owns all intellectual property rights, conceived, invented, discovered or made by Evotec during the performance of its services, other than intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Evotec relating to its already existing technology and components to be used in the services to be provided under the Evotec Agreement.



The Evotec Agreement is subject to a minimum payment of $4,937,500 and a maximum payment of $5,350,250 to Evotec. This program was paused in mid-2019 and the Company expects to re-engage with Evotec in 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has made payments to Evotec in the amount of approximately $1.1 million.



The Petcanna Agreement



On August 20, 2018, we entered into a sublicense agreement with Petcanna Pharma Corp. (“Petcanna”), a private company which was founded by Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann (our Co-Executive Chairman), and Yissum (the “Petcanna Agreement”).



Under the Petcanna Agreement, we granted Petcanna an exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable sublicense to make commercial use of certain patents related to cyclohexenyl compounds and listed in the Petcanna Agreement (the “Petcanna IP”) in order to develop, manufacture, market, distribute or sell products that incorporate the Petcanna IP in products that are intended for the treatment of veterinary medical conditions, initially osteoarthritis.











As consideration for the sublicense, Petcanna agreed to issue to us approximately 9,000,000 of Petcanna’s common shares in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of the date of this filing, Petcanna has not issued shares to any shareholder and has not commenced operations. We intend to retain 85% of such shares and transfer 15% of such shares to Yissum. In the event that Yissum does not accept such shares, we will have an obligation to pay Yissum 15% of the-then current fair market value of such shares. Petcanna will also pay a 1% royalty to us on Petcanna’s net sales of products that incorporate the Petcanna IP.



All right, title and interest in and to the Petcanna IP, including any improvements to the Petcanna IP, will vest solely in our company.



Unless the parties to the Petcanna Agreement agree otherwise in writing, the Petcanna Agreement will terminate on the occurrence of the later of: (i) the date of expiration of the last of the Petcanna IP, (ii) the date of the final expiration of exclusivity on any Product granted by any regulatory or government body, and (iii) the expiration of a continuous period of twenty (20) years during which there was no First Commercial Sale of any product. The terms “Product” and “First Commercial Sale” apply as they are defined in the Petcanna Agreement. Our ability to grant this sublicense to Petcanna is contingent upon (i) Yissum having the necessary rights to the Hebrew Patent Applications assigned to it from all applicable parties, (ii) Yissum being able to grant a license to us per the terms of the Hebrew Agreement, and (iii) the Hebrew Patent Applications and any related resulting patents being valid and maintained in good standing for the respective terms of the Hebrew Licensing Agreement and the Petcanna Agreement.



Kennedy License Agreement



On September 27, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary 180 LP entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Kennedy License Agreement”) with the Kennedy Trust For Rheumatology Research (“Kennedy”), pursuant to which Kennedy granted to 180 LP an exclusive license in the U.S., Japan and member countries of the EU (including the United Kingdom), to certain licensed patents (the “Kennedy Licensed Patents”), including the right to grant sublicenses, and the right to research, develop, sell or manufacture any pharmaceutical product (i) whose research, development, manufacture, use, importation or sale would infringe on the Kennedy Licensed Patents absent the license granted under the Kennedy License Agreement or (ii) containing an antibody that is a fragment of or derived from an antibody whose research, development, manufacture, use, importation or sale would infringe on the Kennedy Licensed Patents absent the license granted under the Kennedy License Agreement, for all human uses, including the diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of diseases and conditions.



Under the Kennedy License Agreement, Kennedy reserves the perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, worldwide right for the Kennedy Licensed Patents and its affiliates, employees, students and other researchers to carry out any acts which would otherwise infringe on the Kennedy Licensed Patents for the purposes of teaching and carrying out research and development, including the right to accept external sponsorship for such research and development and the right to grant sub-licenses for the same purposes.



As consideration for the grant of the Kennedy Licensed Patents, 180 LP paid Kennedy an upfront fee of £60,000, and will also pay Kennedy royalties equal to (i) 1% of the net sales for the first annual $1 billion of net sales, and (ii) 2% of the net sales after the net sales are at or in excess of $1 billion, as well as 25% of all sublicense revenue, provided that the amount of such percentage of sublicense revenue based on amounts which constitute royalties shall not be less than 1% on the first cumulative $1 billion of net sales of the products sold by such sublicenses or their affiliates, and 2% on that portion of the cumulative net sales of the products sold by such sublicenses or their affiliates in excess of $1 billion.



The term of the royalties paid to Kennedy will expire on the later of (i) the last valid claim of a patent included in the Kennedy Licensed Patents which covers or claims the exploitation of a product in the applicable country; (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the product in the country; or (iii) 10 years from first commercial sale of the product in the country.



We may terminate the Kennedy License Agreement without cause by providing 90-days’ notice.











Kinexum Agreement



On January 13, 2023, we entered into a contract with Kinexum in the ordinary course of business (the “MSA”). Pursuant to the MSA, Kinexum will provide assistance to the Company in connection with the Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) and Marketing Approval Application (MAA) which the Company expects to submit to the MHRA in connection with the Company’s planned use of adalimumab to treat progressive early-stage Dupuytren’s disease. Including the costs associated with the Kinexum contract, the Company anticipates that it will spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000, cumulative in the three quarters ending September 30, 2023 for activities associated with the MHRA filing and other regulatory preparation.
Consulting Agreements



The Consulting Agreements are each described below.



Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal Consulting Agreement



On February 25, 2021, we (and CannBioRex Pharma Limited, which was added as a party to the agreement later), entered into a Consultancy Agreement dated February 22, 2021, and effective December 1, 2020, with Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal (as amended, the “Consulting Agreement”). Prof. Nanchahal has been providing services to the Company and/or its subsidiaries since 2014 and is currently a greater than 5% stockholder of the Company and the Chairman of our Clinical Advisory Board.



On March 31, 2021, we entered into a First Amendment to Consultancy Agreement with Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal, which amended the Consultancy Agreement entered into with Prof. Nanchahal on February 25, 2021, to include CannBioRex Pharma Limited, a corporation incorporated and registered in England and Wales (“CannBioRex”), and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as a party thereto, and to update the prior Consultancy Agreement to provide for cash payments due to Prof. Nanchahal to be paid by CannBioRex, for tax purposes, provide for CannBioRex to be party to certain other provisions of the agreement and to provide for the timing of certain cash bonuses due under the terms of the agreement.



Prof. Nanchahal is a surgeon scientist focusing on defining the molecular mechanisms of common diseases and translating his findings through to early phase clinical trials. He undertook his PhD, funded by the U.K. Medical Research Council, whilst a medical student in London and led a lab group funded by external grants throughout his surgical training. After completing fellowships in microsurgery and hand surgery in the USA and Australia, he was appointed as a senior lecturer at Imperial College. His research is focused on promoting tissue regeneration by targeting endogenous stem cells and reducing fibrosis. In 2013 his group identified anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as therapeutic target for Dupuytren’s Contracture, a common fibrotic condition of the hand. He is currently leading a Phase 2b clinical trial funded by the Wellcome Trust and Department of Health to assess the efficacy of local administration of anti-TNF in patients with early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture and a clinical trial for patients with early-stage frozen shoulder. He is a proponent of evidence-based medicine and was the only plastic surgery member of the NICE Guidance Development Groups on complex and non-complex fractures. He was a member of the group that wrote the Standards for the Management of Open Fractures published in 2020. This is an open-source publication to facilitate the care of patients with these severe injuries.



Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Prof. Nanchahal agreed, during the term of the agreement, to serve as a consultant to the Company and provide such services as the Chief Executive Officer and/or the board of directors of the Company shall request from time to time, including but not be limited to: (1) conducting clinical trials in the fields of Dupuytren’s Contracture, frozen shoulder and post-operative delirium/cognitive decline; and (2) conducting laboratory research in other fibrotic disorders, including fibrosis of the liver and lung (collectively, the “Services”).











In consideration for providing the Services, the Company (through CannBioRex Pharma Limited) agreed to pay Prof. Nanchahal 15,000 British Pounds (GBP) per month (approximately $20,800) during the term of the agreement, increasing to GBP 23,000 (approximately $32,000) on the date (a) of publication of the data from the phase 2b clinical trial for Dupuytren’s Contracture (RIDD) and (b) the date that the Company has successfully raised over $15 million in capital. The fee will increase annually thereafter to reflect progression in other clinical trials and laboratory research as approved by the board of directors. The Company also agreed to pay Prof. Nanchahal a bonus (“Bonus 1”) in the sum of GBP 100,000 upon submission of the Dupuytren’s Contracture clinical trial data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, which submission occurred in December 2021, and which bonus was paid in December 2021. In addition, for prior work performed, including completion of the recruitment to the RIDD (Dupuytren’s) trial, the Company agreed to pay Prof. Nanchahal GBP 434,673 (approximately $605,000) (“Bonus 2”). At the election of Prof. Nanchahal, Bonus 2 shall be paid at least 50% (fifty percent) or more, as Prof. Nanchahal elects, in shares of the Company’s common stock, at a share price of $60.00 per share, or the share price on the date of the grant, whichever is lower, with the remainder paid in GBP. Bonus 2 shall be deemed earned and payable upon the Company raising a minimum of $15 million in additional funding, through the sale of debt or equity, after December 1, 2020 (the “Vesting Date”) and shall not be accrued, due or payable prior to such Vesting Date. Bonus 2 shall be payable by the Company within 30 calendar days of the Vesting Date. Finally, Prof. Nanchahal shall receive another one-time bonus (“Bonus 3”) of GBP 5,000 (approximately $7,000) on enrollment of the first patient to the phase 2 frozen shoulder trial, and another one-time bonus (“Bonus 4”) of GBP 5,000 (approximately $7,000) for enrollment of the first patient to the phase 2 delirium/POCD trial. On March 30, 2021, the Company issued Prof. Nanchahal 5,035 shares of Company common stock in lieu of GBP 217,337 and on April 15, 2021, the Company issued Prof. Nanchahal 1,886 shares of Company common stock in lieu of GBP 82,588. The Company also waived the requirement for the Company having to raise $15 million in order for Prof. Nanchahal to agree to receive an aggregate of GBP 300,000 via the issuance of shares. Prof. Nanchahal agreed that the remaining GBP 134,673 that is due pursuant to Bonus 2 shall be paid after the Company has raised a minimum of $15 million in additional funding. On August 23, 2021, at the request of Prof. Nanchahal, the Company agreed to issue Prof. Nanchahal 3,077 shares of common stock in consideration for the remaining 31% (or 134,749 GBP, or $184,606) of Bonus 2, based on a $60.00 per share price. The shares were issued under the Company’s 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which has been approved by stockholders.



Effective on April 27, 2022, we and CannBioRex entered into a Second Amendment to Consulting Agreement with Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal (the “Second Nanchahal Amendment”). Pursuant to the Second Nanchahal Amendment, Prof. Nanchahal agreed that upon acceptance of the data for the phase 2b clinical trial for Dupuytren’s disease for publication (which occurred March 1, 2022, subject to editing and final approvals), his monthly fee was increased to £23,000, provided that £4,000 of such increase shall be accrued and £19,000 per month of such fees shall be payable per the payroll practices of the Company in cash by the Company starting effective March 1, 2022, and until the earlier of (a) November 1, 2022 or (b) such time as the Board of Directors determines that the Company has sufficient cash on hand to pay such Accrued Amounts, which the Company expects will not be until it has raised a minimum of $15,000,000 (the “Funding Determination Date”), at which time all accrued amounts shall be due.



On December 28, 2022, we and CannBioRex, entered into a Third Amendment to Consultancy Agreement with Prof. Nanchahal (the “Third Nanchahal Amendment”). The Third Nanchahal Amendment amended the Consultancy Agreement to provide that the monthly cash fee payable to Prof. Nanchahal pursuant to such agreement would remain at its then current rate, £23,000 per month, through December 31, 2022, and then increase to £35,000 per month during the term of the Consultancy Agreement from January 1, 2023, until the end of the term of the Consultancy Agreement (collectively, the “Fee”). The Third Nanchahal Amendment also provided that the Fee will be adjusted yearly with the recommendation of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Company, which will consider in its determination of the amount of such increase, the U.K. consumer price index and Prof. Nanchahal’s contributions to advancing the Company’s mission, among other things. The Third Nanchahal Amendment also provided that in the event the Consultancy Agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason other than cause, Prof. Nanchahal is entitled to a lump sum payment of 12 months of his monthly fee as at the date of termination.



Notwithstanding the above, the board of directors or Compensation Committee of the Company may grant Prof. Nanchahal additional bonuses from time to time in their discretion, in cash, stock or options.











The Consulting Agreement has an initial term of three years, and renews thereafter for additional three-year terms, until terminated as provided in the agreement. The Consulting Agreement can be terminated by either party with 12 months prior written notice (provided the Company’s right to terminate the agreement may only be exercised if Prof. Nanchahal fails to perform his required duties under the Consulting Agreement), or by the Company immediately if (a) Prof. Nanchahal fails or neglects efficiently and diligently to perform the Services or is guilty of any breach of its or his obligations under the agreement (including any consent granted under it); (b) Prof. Nanchahal is guilty of any fraud or dishonesty or acts in a manner (whether in the performance of the Services or otherwise) which, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, has brought or is likely to bring Prof. Nanchahal, the Company or any of its affiliates into disrepute or is convicted of an arrestable offence (other than a road traffic offence for which a non-custodial penalty is imposed); or (c) Prof. Nanchahal becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors. If the Consulting Agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason other than cause, Prof. Nanchahal is entitled to a lump sum payment of 12 months of his fee as at the date of termination.



The Consulting Agreement includes a 12 month non-compete and non-solicitation obligation of Prof. Nanchahal, preventing him from competing against the Company in any part of any country in which he was actively engaged in the Company’s business, subject to certain exceptions, including research conducted at the University of Oxford. The Consulting Agreement also includes customary confidentiality and assignment of inventions provisions, in each case subject to the Company’s previously existing agreements with various universities, including the University of Oxford, where Prof. Nanchahal serves as a Professor of Hand, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.



Service Agreement with Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann



On June 1, 2018, CannBioRex Pharma Limited (“CannBioRex”) and Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann Ph.D., our Executive Co-Chairman, entered into a Service Agreement (the “Feldmann Employment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Feldmann Employment Agreement, Prof. Sir Feldmann serves as the Chairman, CEO and Executive Director of CannBioRex or in such other capacity consistent with his status. Prof. Sir Feldmann’s responsibilities include those customary for the roles in which he serves. Prof. Sir Feldmann receives compensation of £115,000 per year, with annual compensation reviewed by the Board and eligibility for discretionary bonuses, as determined by the Board. CannBioRex also reimburses Prof. Sir Feldmann’s travelling and other business expenses.



Pursuant to the Feldmann Employment Agreement, all intellectual property rights created by Prof. Sir Feldmann or related to his employment belong to and vest in CannBioRex.



The Feldmann Employment Agreement contains a customary non-compete clause prohibiting Prof. Sir Feldmann from working for any competing businesses during the term of his employment, or holding equity in other businesses, except he may hold or beneficially own securities of publicly-traded companies if the aggregate beneficial interests of him and his family does not exceed 5% of that class of securities.



Prof. Sir Feldmann is also prohibited for 12 months following termination (the “Post-Termination Period”) be involved in any capacity with a competing business or potential joint venture in the United Kingdom or in any other country. During the Post-Termination Period, he may not solicit business from CannBioRex and its affiliates’ customers; or any company with whom he was activity involved in the course of his employment; or about which he holds confidential information. Prof. Sir Feldmann further covenants to not interfere with CannBioRex’s business relationships by inducing or attempting to induce suppliers to take adverse actions during the Post-Termination Period. He also agrees not to induce or attempt to induce any CannBioRex employee to leave the company during the Post-Termination Period. The Feldmann Employment Agreement contains customary non-disclosure and confidentiality obligations, sick leave and vacation time.



The Feldmann Employment Agreement does not have a fixed term. Either party may terminate the agreement by delivering written notice 9 months in advance. CannBioRex may also terminate the Feldmann Employment Agreement at any time with immediate effect by giving written notice. If CannBioRex terminates Prof. Sir Feldmann’s employment without providing 9 months written notice, he will become entitled to a payment equal to his basic salary he would have been entitled to receive if 9 months’ notice were given. The governing law for the Feldmann Employment Agreement is the law of England.



The Board of Directors, as recommended by the Compensation Committee of the Company (and/or the Compensation Committee) or separately, may also award Prof. Sir Feldmann bonuses from time to time (in stock, options, cash, or other forms of consideration) in its discretion.











On November 17, 2021, the Board of Directors, as recommended by the Compensation Committee, increased the salary of Prof. Sir Feldmann to $225,000 per annum. 



Effective on April 27, 2022, CannBioRex and Prof. Sir Feldmann entered into an amendment to the consulting agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed effective March 1, 2022, that Sir Feldmann’s salary would be reduced by $225,000 (100%), and that such reduced amounts would be accrued and paid on the Funding Determination Date.



Lawrence Steinman, M.D. Consulting Agreement



On November 17, 2021, and effective on November 1, 2021, the Company entered into a Consulting Agreement with Lawrence Steinman, M.D., the Company’s Executive Co-Chairman (the “Consulting Agreement”). Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Dr. Steinman agreed to provide certain consulting services to the Company, including, but not limited to, participating in defining and setting strategic objectives of the Company; actively seeking out acquisition and merger candidates; and having primary scientific responsibility for the Company’s á7nAChR platform (collectively, the “Services”). The term of the agreement is for one year (the “Initial Term”); provided that the agreement automatically extends for additional one year periods after the Initial Term (each an “Automatic Renewal Term” and the Initial Term together with all Automatic Renewal Terms, if any, the “Term”), subject to the Renewal Requirements (described below), in the event that neither party provided the other written notice of their intent not to automatically extend the term of the agreement at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Automatic Renewal Term. The Term can only be extended for an Automatic Renewal Term, provided that (i) Dr. Steinman is re-elected to the Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company immediately preceding the date that such Automatic Renewal Term begins; (ii) the Board affirms his appointment as Co-Chairman for the applicable Automatic Renewal Term (or fails to appoint someone else as Co-Chairman prior to such applicable Automatic Renewal Term) and (iii) Dr. Steinman is continuing in his role of having the responsibility for the scientific development for the Company’s á7nAChR platform (the “Renewal Requirements”). The Consulting Agreement also expires immediately upon the earlier of: (i) the date upon which Dr. Steinman no longer serves as Co-Chairman and no longer has primary scientific responsibility for our á7nAChR platform; and (ii) any earlier date requested by either (1) the Company (as evidenced by a vote of a majority of the Board (excluding Dr. Steinman) at a meeting of the Board), or (2) Dr. Steinman (as evidenced by written notice from Dr. Steinman to the Board). Additionally, the Company may terminate the Consulting Agreement immediately and without prior notice if Dr. Steinman is unable or refuses to perform the Services, and either party may terminate the Consulting Agreement immediately and without prior notice if the other party is in breach of any material provision of the Consulting Agreement.



The Company agreed to pay Dr. Steinman $225,000 per year during the term of the agreement, along with a one-time payment of $43,750, representing the difference between his old compensation and new compensation, dating back to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Dr. Steinman agreed to not compete against the Company, unless approved in writing by the Board of Directors, during the term of the agreement, and also agreed to certain customary confidentiality provisions and assignment of inventions requirements. The Consulting Agreement also has a 12-month non-solicitation prohibition following its termination.



On December 8, 2021, Dr. Steinman was also granted stock options to purchase 1,250 shares of the Company’s common stock, which have a term of 10 years; an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, $79.00 per share, and are subject to the Company’s 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. In addition, beginning in calendar year 2022, for each year during the Term of the Consulting Agreement, the Company will, subject to future approval by the Board, grant Dr. Steinman $125,000 of value of equity compensation. Future equity grants will vest over a 48-month period and be in accordance with the Plan. Timing of the future grants, nature of the equity grants (e.g., RSU, PSU, restricted stock, etc.) and any changes in the value of future equity will be recommended by the Company’s Compensation Committee and/or Audit Committee and approved by the Board.



Effective on April 27, 2022, the Company and Dr. Steinman entered into an amendment to the consulting agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed effective March 1, 2022, that Dr. Steinman’s salary would be reduced by $56,250 (25%), and that such reduced amount would be accrued and paid on the Funding Determination Date.











Intellectual Property



Our success depends in significant part on our ability to protect the proprietary elements of our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to defend challenges and oppositions from others and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection in the U.S., U.K., Europe and other countries for our proprietary technologies. Our intellectual property portfolio as of March 31, 2023 includes sixteen patent families with issued and/or pending claims, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery and the therapeutic uses of SCAs, as well as know-how and trade secrets, when including patents held by our partners of which we have exclusive rights.



Within the U.S., we and/or our partners have licensed twelve issued patents and twelve pending patent applications under active prosecution. Outside of the U.S., assuming the E.U. as a single jurisdiction, there are an additional twelve issued patents and 23 pending patent applications under active prosecution. Our policy is to seek patent protection for the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases where we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the technology, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.



The term of individual patents depends upon the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we have filed, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.



The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for extension, which permits term restoration as compensation for the term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits an extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions.



To protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, avail ourselves of the courts or participate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights.



We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Our policy requires our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.



From time to time, in the normal course of our operations, we will be a party to litigation and other dispute matters and claims relating to intellectual property.



180LS’ Research, Development and License Agreements



180LS has entered into research and licensing agreements with various parties, including the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Oxford. For information regarding these agreements, see “Material Agreements”, above.











Competition



Below is a description of the competitive environment of each of our product candidate development platforms and potential product candidates.



Dupuytren’s Contracture



Our treatment is for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture, for which, to our knowledge, there is no approved treatment. Existing treatments focus on late stage Dupuytren’s Contracture, when the fingers are irreversibly curled into the palm. Surgery remains the typical standard treatment, but the relatively long post-operative rehabilitation has driven the reach for less invasive techniques. Xiaflex, a drug developed by Auxilium, has shown effective in treating patients with developed contractures although many patients experience relatively mild side effects. An alternative approach is disruption of the late-stage cords with a needle and data from a comparative clinical trial published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (American) in 2018 showed similar recurrence rates between collagenase and percutaneous needle fasciotomy at 2 years. A clinical trial funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (U.K.) is currently underway in the U.K., comparing the cost efficacy of surgery for Dupuytren’s Contracture with collagenase treatment. The aims of the study are to determine (i) whether collagenase injections are as effective and as safe as surgery for treating this condition and (ii) the costs of both treatments.



SCAs



Following the acquisition of GW Pharmaceuticals PLC and its Epidiolex (cannabidiol) and Sativex (THC & CBD) franchises, by Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Ireland), Jazz Pharma has become the prominent player in the cannabidiol space.  Epidiolex is an oral cannabidiol solution approved for treating seizures in a range of childhood epileptic diseases, including Dravet’s syndrome (formerly known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy), Rett Syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Jazz Pharma is exploring whether Epidiolex is effective in Sturge-Weber Syndrome, in which abnormal development of blood vessels leads to defects in the brain, skin, and eyes from birth, and more broadly in Autism Spectrum Disorder. Clinical trials sponsored by Jazz Pharma testing effectiveness of Epidiolex in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s Disease are ongoing. Collectively, these efforts represent the most extensive cannabidiol clinical program.



To our knowledge, multiple companies are working in the cannabis therapeutic area and are pursuing regulatory approval for their product candidates, including:




● | Cardiol Therapeutics (Canada) which is evaluating the effectiveness of their oral CBD liquid formulation on myocardial recovery in patients presenting with acute myocarditis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (Pennsylvania) which focuses on pharmaceutically produced transdermal cannabinoid therapies for rare and near-rare neuropsychiatric disorders. Zynerba currently is evaluating ZygelTM, a patent-protected transdermal CBD gel for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome, for which it filed an NDA with the FDA, developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, 22q deletion syndrome, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Orcosa, (New Jersey) which is testing their CBD, Oravexx (oral disintegrating tablets), to manage pain and inflammation with the hope of reducing clinical reliance on opioids. The particular indication is pain associated with osteoarthritis in the knee in a Phase 2 trial.

a7nAChR



Antibodies selective for TNFa (Humira) or TNFa receptor (Remicade) and nucleic acid aptamers are injectable reagents, which by their inherent nature have clinical limitations. An orally bioavailable inhibitor of TNFa is a natural complementary reagent to the antibody or aptamer strategy. This is particularly attractive if the mode of action differs between the varying therapeutic reagents. The antibodies and aptamers both are designed to interfere with TNFa signaling, whereas the orally bioavailable drug is an a7 nicotinic acetyl choline receptor agonist known to activate the vagus nerve and the brain- immune system interface.



The 180LS program to develop an orally bioavailable inhibitor of TNFa secretion has significant competition. The most prominent is the collection of Jak inhibitors (Xeljanz, Cibinqo, Olumiant, Rinvoq and Jyseleca) approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. The mode of action is the inhibition of the Jak-Stat pathway principally in cells of the macrophage lineages known to secrete a variety of proinflammatory cytokines including TNFa. The commercial success of these reagents provides practical support for the importance of developing an orally bioavailable product. These drugs are not involved in acetylcholine receptor pathway. Attenua Pharma, a small biotechnology that was using an α7nAChR agonist, bradanicline, in Phase 2 clinical trials for chronic cough was acquired by Coda therapeutics and this program has been discontinued.










The electroceutical companies can be viewed as competition, or a vast proof-of-concept. Because in many respects, the α7nAChR program can be considered as a chemical stimulation of the vagus nerve, and each of the indications benefiting from electrical stimulation, should be amenable to chemical stimulation. To our knowledge, the company closest to an approved product for inflammatory indications is SetPoint Medical Corporation, which has active for inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Their device is a miniaturized stimulator implant, which is surgically placed under general anesthesia on the vagus nerve through a small incision on the left side of the neck. An unexpected result is that a short electrical pulse leads to an extended period of reduction of inflammatory cytokines, of the order of 8-10 hours.



A final consideration is that each of the large pharmaceutical companies that initially developed α7nAChR agonists could revitalize their programs and use their drugs in clinical trials for inflammatory indications.

Lastly, each of the large pharmaceutical companies that initially developed α7nAChR agonists could revitalize their programs and use their drugs in clinical trials for inflammatory indications.



Government Regulation



We have obtained regulatory approvals from the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Dutch Centrale Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek (CCMO), as well as from the relevant accredited ethics committees, in order to perform clinical trials in the U.K. and The Netherlands solely for indications under the anti-TNF platform. Following the successful results of the Phase 2b Dupuytren’s Contracture clinical trial, we are preparing a conditional marketing authorization application to be filed with the MHRA. We have not held any meetings with, and no applications or requests for approval have been submitted to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any indications or products under the anti-TNF platform at this time.
FDA Approval Process



In the U.S., pharmaceutical products, including drugs and biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), a “drug” is defined to include “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals” and “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.” 21 USC 321(g). Like all drugs, biological products are also used for the treatment, prevention or cure of disease in humans. However, in contrast to chemically synthesized small molecular weight drugs, which have a well-defined structure and can be thoroughly characterized, biological products are generally derived from living material, such as human, animal, or microorganism, are complex in structure, and thus are always fully characterized.  The U.S. Public Health Servicer Act (the “PHS Act”) defines a biological product as a “virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product … applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.” 42 USC 262(i). FDA regulations and policies have established that biological products include blood-derived products, vaccines, in vivo diagnostic allergenic products, immunoglobulin products, products containing cells or microorganisms, and most protein products.  Biological products subject to the PHS Act also meet the definition of drugs under the FDC Act. Biological products are a subset of drugs, and therefore both are regulated under provisions of the FDC Act.  However, only biological products are licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act, although some therapeutic protein products have been approved under section 505 of the FDC Act rather than the PHS Act.)



The FDC Act, PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drugs and biologics. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or the FDA’s Biologics License Application (BLAs) or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, withdrawal of approvals, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.



Drug and biologic development in the U.S. typically involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. For commercial approval, the sponsor must submit adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show that the drug/biologic is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. The sponsor must also submit substantial evidence, generally consisting of adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug/biologic will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, including meeting FDA standards for safety, and efficacy for drugs or purity and potency for biologics. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate or disease.











Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product candidate chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), and Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (“GMP”) regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act of 1996. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.



A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold on the IND or otherwise commented or questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND is deemed issued, and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.



Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug/biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with GCP, an international standard and U.S. legal requirement meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, (ii) in compliance with other federal regulations, and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.



The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), for approval. An IRB may also prevent a clinical trial from beginning or require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions.



Clinical trials to support NDAs/BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or otherwise vary in particular circumstances. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug/biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug/biologic is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug/biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug/biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug/biologic. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug/biologic. The FDA may, however, determine that a single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug’s/biologic’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs/biologics, other post-market requirements may be imposed.



In response to specific requirements set forth in the 21st Century Cures Act to address the need for greater patient participation in drug development and evaluation, the FDA has issued its Plan for Issuances of Focused Drug Development Guidance, pursuant to which the FDA will issue a series of guidances intended to address, in a stepwise manner, how stakeholders can collect and submit patient experience data and other relevant information from patients and caregivers for medical product development and regulatory decision making. The guidances are expected to facilitate the advancement and use of systematic approaches to collect and use robust and meaningful patient and caregiver input that can better inform medical product development and regulatory decision making. To date, the FDA has issued three of the planned four guidances on these issues. We expect the issue of patient-centric drug development and evaluation to increase in priority and be more of a factor in clinical trial design, moving forward.











After completion of the required clinical testing, a New Drug Application (“NDA”)/BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA/BLA is required before marketing of the product candidate may begin in the U.S. The NDA/BLA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product candidate’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA/BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs/BLAs is also subject to an application user fee, which, for the fiscal year 2023, is in the amount of approximately $3.2 million (where clinical data is required).



The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA/BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs/BLAs. The FDA’s current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs/BLAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority NDAs/BLAs, but two additional months are added to standard and priority NDAs/BLAs for a new molecular entity/reference biologic. A drug/biologic is eligible for priority review if it addresses an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. These timelines are not legally binding on the FDA.



The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug/biologic products, or drug/biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA/BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.



Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless compliance with GMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA/BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective, or the biologic meets the standards for safety, purity, and potency in the indication studied.



After the FDA evaluates the NDA/BLA and the manufacturing facilities, the FDA issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA/BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two or six months depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.



An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug/biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA/BLA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug/biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug/biologic. Moreover, product candidate approval may require substantial post approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s/biologic’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product candidate approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.











During the declaration of the COVID public health emergency FDA has been exercising enforcement discretion with respect to certain classes of products and has provided for the issuance of Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) which have enabled a number of products to enter the market without formal conventional FDA clearance or approval, and has also drawn FDA resources away from non-COVID related products. The U.S government has since declared the termination of the public health emergency effective May 11, 2023, and thus products authorized by EUAs or afforded enforcement discretion based on the COVID emergency will likely return to conventional clearance and approval requirements.



Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information



Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs/biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product candidate, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. The deadline for submitting the results of these trials can be extended for up to two years if the sponsor certifies that it is seeking approval of an unapproved product or that it will file an application for approval of a new indication for an approved product within one year. Competitors may use the publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval



If our drug/biologic candidate meets the requirements of the FDA’s fast track program, we would seek to have our drug/biologic candidate expedited through this program. The FDA has programs to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs/biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast-track program, the sponsor of a new drug/biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug/biologic candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug/biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug/biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug/biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. In addition to other benefits such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s/biologic’s NDA/BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA/BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.



Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug/biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.



In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug/biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post- approval clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug/biologic from the market on an expedited basis. Unless otherwise informed by the FDA, for an accelerated approval product/biologic, an applicant must submit to the FDA for consideration during the preapproval review period copies of all promotional materials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval. After 120 days following marketing approval, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the labeling or initial publication of the advertisement.











Breakthrough Therapy Designation



As with the FDA’s fast track program, if our drug/biologic candidate meets the requirements to receive the FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation, we would seek to have our drug/biologic candidate expedited through this program. The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation program is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A Breakthrough Therapy is defined, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, as a drug/biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs/biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug/biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of fast-track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and the FDA will either grant or deny the request.



In addition, the 21st Century Cures Act created the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation. RMAT applies to regenerative medicines as a class. Sponsors of certain cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and certain combination products may obtain the RMAT designation for their drug product if the drug is intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and if there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for that disease or condition. Sponsors may make such a request with or after submission of an investigational new drug application.



Sponsors of RMAT-designated products are eligible for increased and earlier interactions with the FDA, similar to those interactions available to sponsors of breakthrough-designated therapies. In addition, they may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. The meetings with sponsors of RMAT-designated products may include discussions of whether accelerated approval would be appropriate based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites.



Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence such as electronic health records; through the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or through post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.



Fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if the FDA grants one of these designations, the FDA may later decide that the drug/biologic products no longer meet the conditions for qualification.



Orange Book Listing and Patent Certification



Based on amendments to the FDC Act made by the Drug Price Competition and Innovation Act of 1984 (commonly known as Hatch-Waxman), in seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product candidate or a claimed method of use of the product candidate. Upon approval of a drug, each of the eligible patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book must, in turn, be the subject of a special certification by the filer of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), for a generic version of the drug, or by the applicant of a hybrid application known as a 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product candidate that has the same active ingredient(s) in the same strengths and dosage form as the reference listed innovator drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the reference listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing (absent a waiver), ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product candidate. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, are considered therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.











The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product candidate in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product candidate. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii statement”, certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of- use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.



If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.



A certification that the new product candidate will not infringe the already approved product candidate’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of notice of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant, or some other order of the court.



Sponsors may also seek to market versions of drug products via a section 505(b)(2) application, which is an NDA pathway that allows an applicant to seek approval for a drug product based on full safety and efficacy documentation, some of which may be from literature or conducted by others and for which the applicant does not have the right of reference. NDA Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a modification, such as a new indication or new dosage form, of a previously approved drug. Section 505(b)(2) applications may rely on the FDA’s previous findings for the safety and effectiveness of the previously approved drug in addition to information obtained by the 505(b)(2) applicant to support the modification of the previously approved drug. Preparing Section 505(b)(2) applications may be less costly and time-consuming than preparing an NDA based entirely on new data and information. Section 505(b)(2) applications are subject to the same patent certification procedures as an ANDA.



New Chemical Entity Exclusivity and Clinical Investigation Exclusivity



Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version of the NCE drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert with new clinical studies required for approval, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change.



An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and thus no ANDA or 505(b)(2) may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.



For a botanical drug, FDA may determine that the active moiety is one or more of the principle components or the complex mixture as a whole. This determination would affect the utility of any five-year exclusivity as well as the ability of any potential generic competitor to demonstrate that it is the same drug as the original botanical drug.











Five-year and three-year exclusivities do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) application for a version of the drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that the 505(b)(1) conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.



Orphan Designation and Exclusivity



The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S.



Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or BLA applicant to receive orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the U.S., except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.



Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity



NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase 2 meeting and submission of the NDA or BLA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.



Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the U.S. that may be granted if certain FDA requirements are met, such as the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits, and the applicant agrees to perform and report on FDA-requested studies within a certain time frame. Pediatric exclusivity adds a period of six months of exclusivity to the end of all existing marketing exclusivity and patents held by the sponsor for that active moiety. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the NDA or BLA sponsor’s data.



Biologics Exclusivity and Biosimilars



The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which amended the PHS Act to create an abbreviated approval pathway under section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product originally licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act.



A reference biologic is granted twelve years of marketing exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, during which time a 351(k) application for a biosimilar of the reference product may not be approved. The reference biologic is also granted four years of so-called data exclusivity, during which time a 351(k) application for a biosimilar of the reference product may not be submitted for review. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.











Biologic Patent Information



In contrast to small molecule drugs, for which applicants are required to submit patent information with their NDAs and certain supplements, an applicant seeking licensure of a biological product need not submit patent information in its BLA or supplements.  Also, unlike small molecule drugs, for which the approvability of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs is impacted by the status of listed patents for the reference NDA drug product, the approvability of section 351(k) applications for biosimilar products is presently delinked from the various processes for resolving patent disputes. Biosimilar applicants have a choice whether to engage in the patent litigation provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), colloquially known as the “patent dance,” to identify and litigate a defined list of patents. However, unlike the listing of small molecule reference listed drugs and patents in the “Orange Book,” there had not been a process for listing patents in the FDA’s List of Licensed Biological Products, commonly known as the “Purple Book.” However, in December 2020 Congress enacted the Biological Product Patent Transparency Act (“BPPT”) (originally introduced as the Purple Book Continuity Act created section 351(k)(9) of the PHS Act. That section requires that a biological product reference sponsor that provides a biosimilar applicant with a patent list as part of the “Patent Dance” BPCIA patent litigation process must now submit those lists to the FDA within 30 days, and further, as of June 2021 the FDA is required to make those lists (along with any revisions or updates) public in the Purple Book database. 
Patent Term Extension



After NDA or BLA approval, owners of relevant drug or biologic patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the product’s testing phase — the time between IND submission and NDA or BLA submission — and all of the review phase — the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.



For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) must determine that approval of the product covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA or BLA has not been submitted.



Advertising and Promotion



Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product candidate will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.



Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.



Post-Approval Changes



Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.











Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance



Adverse event reporting on an expedited basis and submission of periodic adverse event reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform GMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, issue warning letters, request product recalls or take other enforcement actions if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Special Protocol Assessment



A sponsor may reach an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. According to its performance goals, the FDA has committed to evaluating 90 percent of the protocols within 45 days of its receipt of the requests to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA as to the design of the trial except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the study sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA.
Controlled Substances



The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, as amended (“CSA”) and the implementing regulations impose registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, dispensing, importation and other requirements on controlled substances under the oversight of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). The DEA is the federal agency, responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion and abuse of controlled substances.



The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, depending on the substance’s medical effectiveness and abuse potential. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The DEA has placed certain drug products that include cannabidiol, on Schedule V.



Following NDA approval of a drug containing a Schedule I controlled substance, that substance must be rescheduled as a Schedule II, III, IV or V substance before it can be marketed. The Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act enacted on November 25, 2015 and its implementing regulations has removed uncertainty associated with the timing of the DEA rescheduling process after NDA approval, under which a manufacturer may market its product no later than 90 days after the later of: (1) the date on which DEA receives from FDA the scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation; or (2) the date on which DEA receives from FDA notification that FDA has approved the drug. The Act also clarifies that the seven-year orphan exclusivity period begins with the approval of the NDA or DEA scheduling, whichever is later. This changes the previous situation whereby the orphan “clock” began to tick upon FDA’s NDA approval, even though the product could not be marketed until DEA scheduling was complete.











The CSA requires that facilities that manufacture, distribute, dispense, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. Separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes the specific schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. Prior to issuance of a controlled substance registration, the DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling of the controlled substances. The specific security requirements vary by, among other things, the type of business activity conducted, and the type, form, and quantity of controlled substances handled.



In addition, individual states have their own distinct controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensure, distribution, dispensing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements for controlled substances. State boards of pharmacy or similar authorities regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to comply with applicable requirements, such as the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in administrative fines, suspension or revocation of licenses, and civil and criminal liabilities.



U.K./Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation



In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales (including pricing and reimbursement) and distribution of our products, if approved.



Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.



In the EU, medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-marketing regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels. Additional rules also apply at the national level to the manufacture, import, export, storage, distribution and sale of controlled substances. In many EU member states the regulatory authority responsible for medicinal products is also responsible for controlled substances. Responsibility is, however, split in some member states. Generally, any company manufacturing or distributing a medicinal product containing a controlled substance in the EU will need to hold a controlled substances license from the competent national authority and will be subject to specific record-keeping and security obligations. Separate import or export certificates are required for each shipment into or out of the member state.



In the U.K., medicinal products are subject to extensive regulation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), which is an executive agency, sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Care. MHRA regulates by ensuring that medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion meet applicable standards of safety, quality and efficacy, in addition to supporting innovation and research and development that is beneficial to public health.



Clinical Trials and Marketing Approval



Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU/EEA, for example, a clinical trial application (a “CTA”), must be submitted via a single-entry portal for all clinical trials conducted in the EU/EEA (the “CTIS”). Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements and a company has received favorable ethics committee approval, clinical trial development may proceed in that country.



In April 2014, the Clinical Trials Regulation, Reg. (EU) No 536/2014 (the “New Regulation”) was adopted to replace the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the “Prior Directive”). To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the EU/EEA, new EU clinical trials legislation was passed as a “regulation” that is directly applicable to EU/EEA member states. The New Regulation requires the sponsor to submit a single CTA is planned for all EU/EEA member states, which will be submitted via the CTIS, an online portal to streamline the authorization process. The CTIS authorization procedure is composed of two parts: member states jointly cooperate in a Part I assessment, while Part II is assessed by each member state individually. This is a significant change, as under the Prior Directive sponsors had to seek separate approval from national authorities in each country where the trial was to be conducted. The New Regulation became applicable on January 31, 2022 – repealing the Prior Directive as of the same day – and introduced a one-year transition period (until January 31, 2023) during which sponsors could choose whether to submit new CTAs under either the old regime governed by the Prior Directive or the new CTIS. Following the transition period, from January 31, 2023, sponsors must apply for clinical trials under the New Regulation, and by January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials approved under the Prior Directive will need to be transitioned to the New Regulation.











In the U.K., the Prior Directive (implemented by Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004/1031) still applies. On January 31, 2020 the U.K. left the EU and the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”) came into force. Section 1 of the EUWA repealed the European Communities Act 1972 (ECA 1972), which had previously enabled EU law to apply to the U.K. However, Section 1A of the EUWA immediately saved much of the effect of ECA 1972 (in modified form) for the duration of the transition period, and Section 1B saved U.K. legislation that implemented EU requirements. The practical effect of the EUWA was therefore that the New Regulation, which had not yet become applicable was repealed for the U.K., but the Prior Directive was retained. References to the U.K. in this section predominantly refer to Great Britain. Due to the Northern Ireland Protocol at Article 182 of the EUWA certain EU/EEA derived regulatory standards in Northern Ireland were not repealed and therefore in some circumstances still apply. Currently, new negotiations for the Northern Ireland Protocol are taking place and changes to it are expected during 2023. In the U.K., approval must be obtained from the MHRA when a clinical trial is planned. A CTA must be submitted and supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier along with additional supporting information pursuant to the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004/1031 and other applicable guidance documents provided by the MHRA. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only commence after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in the U.K.



The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the EU member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying EU legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines on GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.



To obtain regulatory approval to place a drug on the market in the U.K. or EU/EEA countries, we must submit a marketing authorization application. This application is similar to the NDA in the U.S., with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document, format, which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and nonclinical and clinical trial information. In addition to using national authorization procedures (leading to a marketing authorization on valid in the relevant EU/EEA member state), drugs can be authorized in the EU/EEA by using (i) the centralized authorization procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, or (iii) the decentralized procedure. These three authorization methods available to the EU/EEA are no longer available to the U.K. Drugs can be authorized in the U.K. by the MHRA by using (i) the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway, (ii) the 150-day assessment route, (iii) a "rolling review" route of evaluation for novel products and biotechnological products, (iv) a European Commission (EC) Decision reliance procedure, (v) a decentralized and mutual recognition reliance procedure, or (vi) an "unfettered access" route for marketing authorization applications approved in Northern Ireland.



The European Commission created the centralized procedure for the approval of human drugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU and, by extension (after national implementing decisions) in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which, together with the EU member states, comprise the European Economic Area. Applicants file marketing authorization applications with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), where they are reviewed by a relevant scientific committee, in most cases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission, which uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorization. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the EU, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated “orphan drugs” (drugs used for rare human diseases) and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the voluntary request of the applicant also be used for human drugs that do not fall within the above-mentioned categories if the CHMP agrees that the human drug (a) contains a new active substance not yet approved on November 20, 2004; (b) constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or (c) authorization under the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients at the EU level. Although the U.K. can no longer utilize the EU centralized procedure, until December 31, 2023 the MHRA can utilize the decentralized and mutual recognition reliance procedure to authorize drugs by relying upon EC approvals under the EU centralized procedure. Beyond December 31, 2023, the MHRA intends to have a new regime for an international drug reliance framework.











Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum time frame for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter.



Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.



For those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit marketing authorization applications to the national medicines regulators through one of three procedures: (i) the mutual recognition procedure (which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other EU/EEA member state, and in which the EU/EEA member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other EU/EEA member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health), (ii) the decentralized procedure (in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more EU/EEA member states) or (iii) national authorization procedures (which results in a marketing authorization in a single EU/EEA member state).



Conditional Marketing Authorization



The European Commission may grant a conditional marketing authorization to medicines that address unmet medical needs. This marketing authorization is “conditional” upon carrying out certain activities imposed when authorization is granted (e.g., completing ongoing or new studies or collecting additional data). This applies when the applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product under normal conditions of use, for objective, verifiable reasons and based on specific grounds, and all of the following criteria are met:

● | the benefit-risk balance of the medicine is positive; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data post-authorization; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the medicine fulfils an unmet medical need; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the benefit of the medicine's immediate availability to patients is greater than the risk inherent in the fact that additional data is still required. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually.



In Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) the MHRA has introduced and regulates a national conditional marketing authorization, effective from January 1, 2021; in Northern Ireland, applications for conditional marketing authorization must be submitted to the EMA. The UK scheme has the same eligibility criteria as the EU scheme.



Mutual Recognition Procedure



The mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the EU/EEA. Basically, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products and must be used if the product has already been authorized in one or more member states.











The characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already-existing marketing authorization in member state that is used as a reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other EU/EEA member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the EU/EEA and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states. The concerned member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the reference member state, unless they identify a serious risk to public health.



The MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by EU/EEA member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state is required to update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all concerned member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.



Should any member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the European Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products.



Data Exclusivity



In the U.K. and EU, marketing authorization applications for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials, but instead can refer to the data included in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. If a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.
Orphan Medicinal Products



The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”), may recommend orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU. Additionally, orphan designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product designation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved products for the relevant indication. Following a positive opinion by the COMP, the European Commission generally grants orphan status within 30 days. When the draft decision of the European Commission is not aligned with the COMP opinion, the COMP will reassess orphan status in parallel with EMA review of a marketing authorization application and orphan status may be withdrawn at if the drug no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for instance, because a new product was approved for the indication and no data is available to demonstrate a significant benefit over that new product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorization. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve any similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication, unless it offers a significant clinical benefit or if the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the drug. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.











EU/EEA orphan designations extend to Northern Ireland. Otherwise in the U.K. post-Brexit, applications for the designation of orphan medicinal products are submitted to the MHRA, which applies the same substantive criteria and with the same substantive effect as in the EU (save that, unlike the EU procedure, it is not possible to obtain early orphan designation; the application for designation must be made at the same time as the application for the U.K. marketing authorization). If a medicinal product has been designated orphan in the EU, then a Great Britain orphan marketing authorization application can be made to the MHRA; absent an EU orphan designation a U.K.-wide (including Northern Ireland) orphan marketing authorization application can be made to the MHRA.



Pediatric Development



In the EU and the U.K., companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”), with the EMA or the MHRA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP unless a waiver applies, for example, because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if the product covered by it qualifies for one at the time of approval). This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.



* * * * *



If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.



In addition, most countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our product candidates to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In that case, we would be unable to market our products in those countries in the near future or perhaps at all.



Reimbursement



Sales of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, and commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, utilization management and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payers do not consider our future products to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), imposed requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D is available through both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from nongovernmental payers.



On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This law provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. This research is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures must be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear how such a result could be avoided and what if any effect the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.



The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) was enacted in March 2010. The ACA was enacted with the goal of expanding coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare D program. We still cannot fully predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet been completed, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has publicly announced that it is analyzing the ACA regulations and policies that have been issued to determine if changes should be made. In addition, although the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, some states have stated their intentions to not implement certain sections of the ACA and some members of Congress are still working to repeal the ACA. These challenges add to the uncertainty of the changes enacted as part of the ACA. In addition, the current legal challenges to the ACA, as well as Congressional efforts to repeal the ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of the ACA.



In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, some EU jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between EU member states. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. In the EU, the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become intense. As a result, barriers to entry of new products are becoming increasingly high and patients are unlikely to use a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government or other public or private payers.











Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements



In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (“VHCA”), each as amended. If future products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and U.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service-designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, discounted prices must be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the federal acquisition regulations.



In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state, even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities or register their sales representatives. Other legislation has been enacted in certain states prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Likewise, these activities are subject to authorization or license requirements, or other legal requirements, under EU or EU member states’ law, or the law of other countries where we operate or have products manufactured or distributed.



Cost of Compliance with Environmental Laws



Our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. We are not aware of any costs or effects of our compliance with environmental laws.
Climate Change Related Regulation



Our operations are focused on research and development of pharmaceutical products, and a significant portion of such research and development is conducted outside of our facilities and by outsourced contract research organizations or universities. As a result, we do not anticipate any regulation surrounding climate change to impact our operations.



However, there is potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact the facilities of our partners and our future suppliers. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to the facilities of our partners and future suppliers and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future. We periodically review our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and other natural disasters and update our assessments accordingly. Based on our reviews, we do not believe these potential risks are material to our operations at this time.











Employees and Human Capital Management



As of March 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had five full-time employees. One of these employees is located in the U.K., and four are located in the U.S.



In addition, we employ a limited number of part-time employees on a temporary basis, as well as scientific advisors, consultants and service providers, mainly through academic institutions and contract research organizations.



We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or represented by a labor union. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.



Corporate History



Formation



We were formed as a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 7, 2016. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, stock purchase, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses. Since formation, we focused our efforts on acquiring an operating company in the healthcare and related wellness industry although our efforts in identifying a prospective target business were not limited to a particular industry.
Initial Public Offering



On June 7, 2017, pursuant to the Company’s Initial Public Offering (the “IPO”), the Company sold 11,500,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, inclusive of 1,500,000 Units sold to the underwriters on June 23, 2017 upon the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000. Each “Unit” consisted of one-twentieth of a share of the Company’s common stock, one right to receive one-200th of one share of the Company’s common stock upon the consummation of a business combination (“Right”), and one redeemable warrant to purchase one-fortieth of one share of the Company’s common stock (the “Public Warrants”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-fortieth of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per 1/40th of one share ($230.00 per whole share), subject to adjustment. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants became exercisable 12 months from the closing of the IPO, and expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination (November 6, 2025).



The Company may redeem the Public Warrants, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant upon 30 days’ notice (“30-day redemption period”), only in the event that the last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $360.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given, provided there is an effective registration statement with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption as described above, the Company’s management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a “cashless basis,” management will consider, among other factors, the Company’s cash position, the number of Public Warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on the Company’s stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Public Warrants. Each holder of a Right received one-200th (1/200) of one share of common stock upon consummation of the Business Combination. No fractional shares were issued upon exchange of the Rights.











Private Placement



Concurrent with the closing of the IPO, KBL IV Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and the underwriters purchased an aggregate of 450,000 unregistered Units (“Private Units”) at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $4,500,000 in a private placement. In addition, on June 23, 2017, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 52,500 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, which were purchased by the Sponsor and underwriters, generating gross proceeds of $525,000. Of these, 377,500 Private Units were purchased by the Sponsor and 125,000 Private Units were purchased by the underwriters. The proceeds from the Private Units were added to the net proceeds from the IPO held in a Trust Account (the “Trust Account”). The Private Units (including their component securities) were not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination (defined below) and the warrants included in the Private Units (the “Private Placement Warrants”) will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor, the underwriters or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor, the underwriters or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO. In addition, for as long as the Private Placement Warrants are held by the underwriters or its designees or affiliates, they may not be exercised after five years from the effective date of the registration statement related to the IPO. Otherwise, the Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO and have no net cash settlement provisions.
Business Combination



On July 25, 2019, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”), with KBL Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), 180 Life Corp. (f/k/a 180 Life Sciences Corp.)(“180”), Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Katexco”), CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“CBR Pharma”), 180 Therapeutics L.P. (“180 LP” and together with Katexco and CBR Pharma, the “180 Subsidiaries” and, together with 180 Life Sciences Corp., the “180 Parties”), and Lawrence Pemble, in his capacity as representative of the stockholders of the 180 Parties (the “Stockholder Representative”). The business combination described in the Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination”), closed and became effective on November 6, 2020 (the “Closing”). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into 180, with 180 continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). In connection with, and prior to, the Closing, 180 Life Sciences Corp. filed a Certificate of Amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation in Delaware to change its name to 180 Life Corp., and our company (which was known as of our entry into the Business Combination as KBL Merger Corp. IV, changed our name to 180 Life Sciences Corp.).



180 was incorporated in Delaware on January 28, 2019. Prior to the Closing of the Business Combination, 180 operated through three subsidiaries: 180 LP, a Delaware limited partnership formed on September 6, 2013; Katexco, a company incorporated in British Columbia, Canada on March 7, 2018; and CBR Pharma, a company incorporated in British Columbia, Canada on March 8, 2018.



In July 2019, 180 and each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma completed a corporate restructuring, pursuant to which 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma became wholly-owned subsidiaries of 180LS (the “Reorganization”). The corporate restructuring arrangements with respect to Katexco and CBR Pharma were completed under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).



On November 6, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), the Company consummated the Business Combination following a special meeting of stockholders held on November 5, 2020, where the stockholders of the Company considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into 180, with 180 continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger became effective on November 6, 2020 (such time, the “Effective Time”, and the closing of the Merger being referred to herein as the “Closing”). In connection with, and prior to, the Closing, 180 filed a Certificate of Amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation in Delaware to change its name to 180 Life Corp. and KBL Merger Corp. IV changed its name to 180 Life Sciences Corp.











At the Effective Time, each share of 180 common stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time was automatically converted into the right to receive approximately 8.41892 shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (such shares of Common Stock issuable to the common stockholders of 180 pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the “Merger Consideration Shares”). An aggregate of 874,737 shares of common stock have been issued to date to the common stockholders of 180 as Merger Consideration Shares, including the Escrow Shares (as defined below). Also at the Effective Time, each share underlying the 180 preferred stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive one Class C Special Voting Share of the Company, or one Class K Special Voting Share of the Company, as applicable (such shares, the “Special Voting Shares”). The Special Voting Shares entitle the holder thereof to an aggregate number of votes, on any particular matter, proposition or question, equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares (as defined below) of each of CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC and Katexco Purchaseco ULC, Canadian subsidiaries of 180, respectively, that are outstanding from time to time.



As a result of the Merger, the existing exchangeable shares (collectively, the “Exchangeable Shares”) of CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC and/or Katexco Purchaseco ULC were adjusted in accordance with the share provisions in the articles of CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC or Katexco Purchaseco ULC, as applicable, governing the Exchangeable Shares such that they were multiplied by the exchange ratio for the Merger and became exchangeable into shares of Common Stock. The Exchangeable Shares entitle the holders to dividends and other rights that are substantially economically equivalent to those of holders of Common Stock, and holders of Exchangeable Shares have the right to vote at meetings of the stockholders of the Company. An aggregate of 264 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares upon the exchange thereof.



Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, 52,500 of the Merger Consideration Shares (such shares, the “Escrow Shares”) were deposited into an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) to serve as security for, and the exclusive source of payment of, the Company’s indemnity rights under the Business Combination Agreement, all of which were planned to be released to the same stockholders 12 months following the Closing of the Business Combination, but for a claim made by Dr. Krauss against these shares which is pending.



As a result of the Business Combination, the former stockholders of 180 became the controlling stockholders of the Company and 180 became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby 180 is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.



In connection with the Closing, the Company withdrew $9,006,493 of funds from the Trust Account (as defined below) to fund the redemptions of 40,824 shares.



Reverse Stock Split



On December 15, 2022, at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders of 180 Life Sciences Corp., the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, by a ratio of between one-for-four to one-for-twenty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be determined by our Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof in its discretion, at any time after approval of the amendment and prior to December 15, 2023 (the “Stockholder Authority”). On December 15, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), with the Stockholder Authority, approved an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20 (the “Reverse Stock Split”).



Immediately after the Special Meeting and the approval thereof by the Board, on December 15, 2022, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the Reverse Stock Split. A copy of the Certificate of Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.



Pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, the Reverse Stock Split became effective on December 19, 2022 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (the “Effective Time”). No change was made to the trading symbol for the Company’s shares of common stock or public warrants, “ATNF” and “ATNFW”, respectively, in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.











The Certificate of Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized shares of our common stock, nor alter the par value of our common stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of our common stock.



No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split and stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares, were instead entitled to have their fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share.



The effects of the 1-for-20 Reverse Stock Split have been retroactively reflected throughout this Report.
