Item 1. | Business.
------------------------------------+----------

Overview
 
We are an advanced materials and technology development company operating in the fuel cell and hydrogen technology space. We develop, manufacture, and assemble complete fuel cell systems and the critical components that determine the performance of hydrogen fuel cells and other energy systems.
 
We develop and manufacture high-temperature proton exchange membranes (“HT-PEM” or “HT-PEMs”) and fuel cell systems for the off-grid and portable power markets and plan to expand into the mobility market. Select applications are telecom towers (5G and older), energy infrastructure (methane emissions mitigation for the oil and gas industry), and portable power for defense or emergency response units. Our mission is to become a leading provider of fuel cell systems, HT-PEMs, fuel cells, and HT-PEM based membrane electrode assemblies (“MEA” or “MEAs”), which are critical components used in fuel cells, and other electrochemical applications such as electrolyzers and flow batteries. We develop the core chemistry components, the MEAs, that enable fuel cells to operate at high temperatures and also provide these MEAs to third-party fuel cell manufacturers. HT-PEM fuel cells have the advantage of operating with multiple low-carbon fuels (in addition to hydrogen) and under extreme conditions.
 
Our current revenue is derived from the sale of fuel cell systems and from the sale of MEAs, membranes, and electrodes for specific applications in the fuel cell and energy storage (flow battery) markets. While fuel cell systems sales and associated revenue is expected to provide the majority of our income in the near future, the MEA innovation is expected to facilitate strategic partnerships between us and Tier 1 suppliers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) as these downstream manufacturers develop their own white-labelled HT-PEM products.
 
We have our headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts, which includes a product development and research and development facility, and have MEA fabrication and system production facilities in Livermore, California; Achern, Germany; Aalborg, Denmark; and Patras, Greece. We plan to scale-up U.S. and European production and its global sales operations to handle future demand. Our investment priorities are increasing MEA production volumes, executing on new product development initiatives (next-generation fuel cell systems and MEAs), and optimizing production operations to improve unit costs.
 
Our principal focus is on the total fuel cell market, from components to complete systems, and we plan to use our products and technology to address pressing global climate needs. Fuel cell and hydrogen technology is expected to play a critical role in global decarbonization. In order to meet the targets established in the Paris Climate Accords, which seek to mitigate climate change and maintain global temperature less than 1.5°C-2.0°C above pre-industrial levels, the global community will need to accelerate the adoption of technologies like our fuel cells, that reduce or eliminate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. We believe that fuel cells will be a key component of the future energy generation platform given that:
 

● | Fuel cells generate electricity and heat from hydrogen-based fuels, thereby substantially reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants generated by the combustion process in internal combustion engines (“ICE” or “ICEs”) and diesel generators. Fuel cells can be powered autonomously for hours or days where the fuel comes from a discrete source, or for longer where there is a pipeline or other large available source of fuel such as a tank. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fuel cells utilize fuels with a high energy density relative to lithium-ion batteries and other battery technology (according to ARPA-E power densities, hydrogen contains 40,000 Wh/kg while lithium-ion batteries carry only about 260Wh/kg). This makes fuel cell technology well-suited for use in mobility and off-grid energy generation applications where battery technology faces limitations such as lifespan, self-discharge, weight (fuel cells are between 3 to 25 times lighter than batteries providing equivalent power), operation under almost any weather conditions, and recharge times.

● | We expect that hydrogen will also be used to create liquid, synthetic fuels (eFuels like eMethanol, made by combining hydrogen with carbon dioxide for a net-zero liquid fuel) that have the advantage of lower transportation costs and network infrastructure investment relative to hydrogen gas. Fuels like methanol have become subject to an increasing interest in Asia because they are currently available. We believe methanol has the potential to become a leading zero-emissions liquid fuel that can leverage the current global infrastructure from gas stations to fuel tankers and trucks. Given the urgency to decarbonize power generation, and the challenges the investment requirement poses for developing countries, we expect methanol to have an increasingly significant role as a liquid hydrogen carrier and a low/no carbon dioxide emission alternative to oil. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fuel Cell Industry
 
Fuel cell and hydrogen technology is expected to play a critical role in global decarbonization given the clean nature of emissions from hydrogen and hydrogen-carrier fuels relative to fossil fuels. In addition, the challenges associated with existing battery technology limit it from mass adoption across industries. Globally, an average of $38 billion per annum is expected to be invested in the hydrogen and fuel cell sector between 2020 and 2040 with the goal of significantly increasing production capacity while lowering the cost of production. While the availability of hydrogen limited the fuel cell industry in the past, it is now expected to become an opportunity for growth, particularly in sectors such as industrials, power generation and automotive.
 
Within the fuel cell market, our products have significant advantages relative to its competitors that are focused on low-temperature proton exchange membrane technology (“LT-PEM” or “LT-PEMs”). We believe these advantages will help us secure commercial opportunities in the fuel cell market and help drive wide-spread adoption of fuel cell technology. The benefits of our HT-PEMs relative to LT-PEMs include:
 

● | We have developed our products under the principle of “Any Fuel. Anywhere.” which can be distilled into the two components: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Any Fuel: While LT-PEMs require high-purity hydrogen to operate, our HT-PEMs can utilize low cost and abundant hydrogen-carrier fuels, including methanol, natural gas, e-fuels, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, dimethyl ether, and renewable biofuels. The infrastructure required for clean energy powered solely by high-purity hydrogen would cost trillions of dollars. In contrast, many of the hydrogen-carrier fuels can use existing or in-development infrastructure and have a much lower transport cost than hydrogen. This key technology differentiator bypasses the need to commit to a specific energy distribution network and leverages existing infrastructure. Most importantly, it provides an immediately serviceable market today, while we believe many LT-PEM competitors may have to wait another decade for the availability of green, high-purity, inexpensive hydrogen, and potentially longer for the maturity of hydrogen transportation and storage networks. Given the urgency to decarbonize power generation, and the investment challenges faced by developing countries, we expect methanol to have an increasingly significant role as a liquid hydrogen carrier and a low or no carbon dioxide emission alternative to oil. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Anywhere: Our HT-PEM fuel cells have the ability to operate in a variety of practical conditions, including a wide range of geographies, weather, ambient temperatures (as low as -20oC and up to +55oC), and in humid or polluted environments. LT-PEM fuel cells, on the other hand, tend to struggle in the heat, can be damaged by dry climates, or polluted air, and cannot handle impurities of the hydrogen supply. LT-PEM technology is intolerant to CO damage (with performance degradation at levels as low as 10 ppm), while HT-PEM can withstand 1-4% CO concentrations, depending on temperature and operation. For example, readily available low-cost hydrogen can be made with 1-2% carbon monoxide (20,000ppm), which works well with HT- PEMs. LT-PEM loses performance with only 10ppm of carbon monoxide. The relative durability of our products in a range of environments also provides a longer life of operation relative to LT-PEM fuel cells. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Our HT-PEM technology significantly reduces the balance of plant requirements of a fuel cell system relative to LT-PEM fuel cells. This means that fuel cells using our HT-PEMs have simplified requirements for supporting components and auxiliary systems, which enables reduced cost and increases application range for the end-user. It does this through two methods: 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Superior Heat Management: HT-PEM fuel cells operate at high temperatures (between 160°C and 220°C, with next-generation MEA-based fuel cells operating between 80°C and 240°C). Therefore, the temperature differential between a HT-PEM fuel cell and the outside environment is large. As a result, only a small radiator, similar or smaller than the radiator in an ICE vehicle, is needed to transfer heat away from the fuel cell stack. Conversely, because LT-PEM fuel cells run relatively cooler (under 85°C), a significantly larger radiator is required to effectively maintain suitable operating temperatures and conditions for an LT-PEM fuel cell. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | Water Management Issues: HT-PEM fuel cells use phosphoric acid as an electrolyte rather than water-assisted membranes. Therefore, they reduce the need for water balance and other compensating engineering systems. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Solution
 
Our core product offering include:
 

1. | Systems: Fuel cells for portable and stationary applications of power generation, in the range of 20W to 20kW. These fuel cells have applications in the telecom tower (e.g. 5G, 4G) power, surveillance, defense (and other portable power applications), energy (and other critical) infrastructure, and auxiliary power (marine, leisure) markets. Our fuel cells are manufactured in the U.S., Denmark, and Germany. Fuel cell systems provide the majority of our current revenue. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The next generation of our fuel cells, in the 15kW to 1MW range, is expected to target the mobility sector (e.g., heavy-duty automotive, mining equipment, marine, aerospace, and unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAV”)). We are planning to enter into joint development agreements with Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs to bring HT-PEM fuel cells to the mobility market. We intend to be a provider of MEAs and core technology via licensing, rather than producing end-products for the mobility industry. Revenue from joint development agreements may include engineering fees during the 1-3 year initial development cycle, MEA sales, and on-going licensing fees. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | We are a developer of the key component of the fuel cell, the MEA. The operation of the MEA is key to the functionality and characteristics of a fuel cell system. Our MEA enables a robust, long-lasting, and ultimately low-cost fuel cell product, relative to LT-PEM technologies. In addition to our fuel cell system offerings, our MEA is also a discrete product offering to third-party fuel cell manufacturers. MEA sales are expected to be a rapidly growing market in the future as more and more fuel cells are deployed globally by third parties, especially in the mobility space. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Outlook
 
In 2021, we became publicly listed on NASDAQ. We also acquired UltraCell LLC (“UltraCell”), which spearheaded our product offering in the portable and defense markets. In the defense sector, we deliver human portable systems. In addition, the UltraCell portable system is being repurposed to provide remote power to oil and gas wellheads (Advent M-ZERØ family of products) and to address the critical problem of methane emissions in Canada and the U.S. Furthermore, the Company has continued with delivery of MEAs to fuel cell manufacturers in Asia and with delivery of electrodes to the high-growth redox flow-battery market.
 
In September 2021, we completed the acquisition of SerEnergy A/S (“SerEnergy”) and fischer eco solutions GmbH (“FES”), a leading manufacturer of fuel cell systems, with thousands of systems shipped in recent years. SerEnergy is located in Denmark and FES is located in Germany. The acquisition effectively doubled our team to over 170 people, and we believe the acquired business will be a strong pillar of its potential growth strategy. SerEnergy and FES have significant production capabilities, are expected to benefit significantly from our next-generation MEAs and are expected to provide a very strong foothold in the off-grid market. SerEnergy systems, primarily in the 5kW range, target the telecoms industry (especially the growing 5G tower demand) and other diesel generator replacement off-grid markets.

On June 16, 2022, we announced the receipt of a notification from the Greek State informing the Company that one of the Important Projects of Common European Interests (“IPCEIs”), Green HiPo, was submitted for ratification by the European Union (“EU”) for funding of €782.1 million, spread over six years. On July 15, 2022, we received official ratification from the European Commission of the EU. The Green HiPo project is designed to bring the development, design, and manufacture of HT-PEM fuel cells and electrolysers for the production of power and green hydrogen to the Western Macedonia region of Greece.
 
Our growth strategy is focused on targeting the following four sectors:
 

● | The stationary off-grid market, expected to be a growing market. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The human-portable defense, surveillance, energy infrastructure, and leisure market based on UltraCell’s innovative products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The development of next-generation MEA and fuel cell solutions for the mobility market. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The large-scale fuel cell systems market (power generation and power to gas). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Strengths
 
Simplified balance of plant technology: Our HT-PEM technology significantly reduces the balance of plant requirements of a fuel cell system relative to LT-PEM fuel cells. Fuel cells utilizing our technology have simplified requirements for supporting components and auxiliary systems because they reduce the complexity of water management systems. Our technology enables advanced, low-cost and simplified cooling technology, and increases the application range for the end-user. This is especially important for air, heavy-duty transportation, and marine applications.
 
Leveraging existing fuel infrastructure: Given the fuel-flexible nature of our technology, we are able to leverage the existing fuel delivery infrastructure – e.g. around 3 million miles of natural gas pipelines connecting production, storage and distribution systems in the U.S. – to deliver power to a wide range of customers and markets today. Our plug-and-play dynamic enables swift “time-to-market” capabilities. By contrast, the infrastructure investment required for a high-purity hydrogen economy is expected to be significant – approximately $15 trillion between now and 2050 globally.
 
Experienced management team with proven track record: The team that we have recruited to bring innovation to the fuel cell industry is highly experienced with a long pedigree in R&D and world-class manufacturing. Our team has been developing MEA components since 2006 and is led by Dr. Emory De Castro (CTO) who has significant industrial experience. In addition, we initiated in 2021 a joint development effort under the U.S. Department of Energy (“DoE”) umbrella to commercialize next-generation MEAs and ultra-low platinum catalyst solutions developed by Los Alamos, NREL Laboratories, and Brookhaven Laboratories in the U.S. We were selected as the scale-up and commercialization partner of the DoE and are working closely with the highly-skilled R&D teams of top U.S. labs.
 
Following the acquisitions of UltraCell, SerEnergy and FES, and our ongoing recruiting and development in the U.S., we have significantly increased our product, system integration, manufacturing, and testing capabilities. UltraCell brings Silicon Valley-type innovation, while SerEnergy’s expertise and world-class reputation in the stationary fuel cell industry is well established. Our team now numbers over 175 people, many with more than a decade of hands-on expertise in the HT-PEM market. Our investment plan reflects its strategic goal to assemble significant global know-how of the HT-PEM industry. We expect that HT-PEM, with technology initially developed decades after LT-PEM, is in early stages of growth as compared to LT-PEM, a technology initially developed during the 1960s.
 
Technology
 
Our fuel cells can use “Any Fuel. Anywhere.” because of the HT-PEM technology that we have pioneered since 2006. High-temperature fuel cells currently operate at high temperatures (between 160°C and 220°C) and have the potential to operate between 80°C and 240°C, unlike typical LT-PEM fuel cells that are limited to below 100°C. This temperature advantage allows the fuel cell to work with other fuels and to have reliable operation at extreme conditions, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage for the stationary power generation market.

Enhanced market opportunity: The multi-fuel capability enables us to have a very strong position in the off-grid and portable power market in select applications like telecom towers and critical infrastructure power needs. In these applications, diesel generators are primed for replacement for environmental and cost reasons, batteries are unable to provide a long-term year-round solution, and hydrogen presents difficult logistical concerns. We believe fuels like methanol are a more compelling choice and that our HT-PEM fuel cells are highly suitable for these applications. We believe decreasing fuel cell costs, due to technology innovation and manufacturing scale-up, can provide us with an opportunity to grow in the power generation market and potentially displace diesel generators in applications with a clear total cost of ownership value proposition, in addition to the environmental mandate.
 
The next-generation of our fuel cells is being developed in collaboration with the U.S. DoE after we were awarded the L’Innovator commercialization program. Under this program, we are working closely with the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to commercialize the decade-long materials advancements in the field of MEA development. We expect that these next-generation MEAs (“Advanced MEA”) will bring the HT-PEM technology into the mobility area by enabling fuel cells to be lightweight with high-power density. The Advanced MEA is also anticipated to deliver as much as three times the power output of its current MEA product. While we are already projecting being able to pass through substantial cost benefits to its customers through economies of scale as it increases MEA production, the successful development of the Advanced MEA will be an important factor in delivering the required improvement in cost effective performance to our customers.
 
Based on the several critical advantages offered by our HT-PEM technology over batteries and LT-PEM technology, we expect to be highly competitive in numerous applications. In particular, our HT-PEM fuel cells and MEAs are well-suited to off-grid power, portable power applications, combined heat and power, and mobility (e.g., heavy-duty automotive, aviation, mining equipment, marine, and UAV). Our goal is to partner with Tier 1 suppliers and OEMs in these new markets, focusing on the fuel cell technology development, licensing, and the mass production of the next-generation MEAs.
 

1. | Off-Grid Power: We have a growing presence in the off-grid power market, with its acquired SerEnergy subsidiary having shipped thousands of systems worldwide to telecommunications providers for back-up power systems and stationary power sectors. Methanol is easier and cheaper to deliver to remote locations compared to pure hydrogen, providing our HT-PEM technology with an advantage in the off-grid market. Off-grid fuel cell solutions can use methanol already available at some remote industrial sites, like wellheads. Additionally, methanol can be found in products already present at some remote sites, such as certain windshield washer fluids. These products could be repurposed as a fuel source for the fuel cell. Fuel cells in these applications produce significantly less of the greenhouse gases compared to ICE generators and produce power without ICEs’ attendant high levels of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides or particulate emissions. Off-grid power solutions have the potential to run full-time, 365 days a year, 24 hours per day. Our launch of the M-ZERØ methanol-fueled low-power system targets the power generation needs of remote oil and gas locations. The current method of powering such equipment results in significant methane emissions that are equivalent to millions of cars’ emissions per year. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Portable Power: Our acquisition of Silicon Valley-based UltraCell provided us with complete system technology for the portable power and defense markets. Electrification is one of the key initiatives in the defense industry as the needs for mobility and power on demand are increasing dramatically. Our fuel cells have already been deployed by the US Department of Defense (“DoD”), in the XX-55 portable power system, while the next-generation “Honey Badger” product, a wearable fuel cell designed to provide soldiers with on the go power, is currently in the DoD’s demonstration/validation program. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The above markets define our current products, while the markets below constitute its largest opportunities for growth in the future:
 

3. | Combined Heat and Power (“CHP”): By virtue of their high temperature operation, HT-PEM fuel cells are well suited for delivering heat in addition to power to large commercial buildings and single or multi-family homes. The CHP efficiency is at the 85%-90% range, making HT-PEM fuel cells extremely efficient for such uses. HT-PEM fuel cells can be supplied by existing natural gas infrastructure and eventually by a future hydrogen-blend or pure-hydrogen pipeline network. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. | Automotive: By charging electric vehicles’ batteries on-board through the conversion of high-purity hydrogen or hydrogen-carrier fuels into electricity, our fuel cells solve the range and recharging issues that battery-only electric vehicles currently face. This issue is a particular challenge in heavy-duty and commercial vehicles. Since our fuel cells can use hydrogen-carrier fuels such as natural gas, methanol and biofuels, fuels that are of growing in importance in China, India, and Western Europe, we believe that our technology will be critical in accelerating the mass adoption of electric vehicles and the shift away from ICEs. Existing battery and LT-PEM technology are unable to meet the needs of heavy-duty transportation which require long-range, heavy payloads, fast refill times, and the ability to operate in diverse environments. For example, LT-PEM fuel cells are unable to operate in hot environments because the radiator required to cool the MEA to the appropriate temperature range would be too large and therefore impractical. The use of battery-only technology has the added disadvantage of insufficient power capacity without a substantial volume and weight of batteries, which results in a significant reduction in cargo capacity. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Aviation: Our fuel cells can deliver much longer range (autonomy) and better utilization (through faster time to refill and greater payload) for commercial drones, eVTOLs, and auxiliary power for traditional aircraft than battery power alone can deliver. Existing commercial drones based on battery-only technology have a limited flight time given the power limitations of the lightweight requirements of flight. Compared to battery powered flights, aircrafts powered by fuel cells using next generation HT-PEMs and ultra-lightweight non-metal plates could increase range, payload/passenger capacity, and the number of trips made on one charge or fill-up. HT-PEM aircraft have the potential to refuel significantly faster than an equivalent battery could recharge. The high-purity hydrogen currently required by LT-PEM is considered unsafe for widespread commercial use, while our HT-PEM provides sufficient range using safer liquid fuels and the Company believes it is key to efficient real-world flight usage. Hydrogen gas and dimethyl ether are suitable for use as fuel for aviation fuel cells, and both work well with HT-PEM technology. Additionally, high-temperature operation in aviation is essential, given heat exchange issues. Fuel cells have shown that drones can stay airborne for longer periods of time, which enhances their value proposition and business applications. We expect drone prototypes based on our technology to be available as soon as 2023. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Marine: In the marine industry, neither compressed hydrogen nor batteries are a viable option for commercial shipping. The industry is evaluating alternative fuels to replace bunker fuel, and methanol appears to be among the most likely hydrogen carriers positioned to meet the European Union’s 2050 decarbonization objectives. Our fuel cells are well-suited for methanol use, as the high-temperature operation can use low-grade hydrogen (converted from methanol via reformation) that does not work with current LT-PEM fuel cells. Applications in the marine industry are likely to develop initially in auxiliary power and smaller ships, and eventually scale to the multi-MW range main propulsion market. Our fuel cells promise fuel flexibility with hydrogen gas, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, methanol, and natural gas, and operate at high temperatures through proprietary chemistry. Marine applications could be scalable for divergent load requirements and applications such as powering the entire propulsion system or, alternatively, providing auxiliary power to a differently powered primary propulsion system. Marine fuel cell usage could offer long range and a fast refill; unlike battery power, and longer routes and larger vessels can be powered by fuel cells as compared to batteries. In addition, fuel cells can be used in a hybrid structure in conjunction with battery power. We are planning our initial focus on applications for auxiliary marine power, and then plans to focus on vessels’ main power. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have been issued, acquired, licensed, or applied for approximately 200 international and United States patents, with a concentration in membranes, electrodes, and MEAs, which support its product offerings. In the MEA sector, our products include two existing membrane technologies: “TPS®”, which we have exclusive rights to use and was obtained through patents filed by its founders and technical staff, and “PBI” technology, of which we are a selective licensee, and provides exclusive rights to us for commercial sale of MEAs using PBI technology. Leveraging our membrane technologies, we also have intellectual property for lightweight stacks made through advances in bipolar plate materials, which supports water-cooled systems. This results in a simpler and more compact balance-of-plant design. Our own investments in developing leading next-generation fuel cell technology are supported by being able to leverage the research and development efforts of its strategic partners. We are planning next generation prototypes for fuel stacks, with pilot production expected as soon as 2023 and mass production expected as soon as 2024.

Our rights to commercialize the next-generation HT-PEM materials technology from the DoE L’Innovator Program also includes rights to a portfolio of patents supporting this advanced technology. We were selected through a highly competitive bidding process by virtue of our management team’s track record in taking laboratory inventions and processes through to a fully-scaled and manufactured product. We expect that this technology will reduce production costs of its MEAs significantly through a 3-fold increase in power output per unit area of membrane, and will provide longer operating lifetime and a wider temperature operating range as well as substantially lower platinum content. We expect these advantages will enable us to reduce the cost to end-users of fuel cells and encourage a wider market adoption. We anticipate commercialization and mass manufacture of this product by 2023. This and other partnerships, joint ventures, and joint development agreements, including with DoE, NASA (through Advent’s affiliation with Northeastern University) and the European Space Agency, are expected to assist Advent in the mobility and off-grid power markets.
 
Our products and technology are currently being used in the marketplace to generate electricity for commercial applications, and we are developing partnerships with Tier 1 suppliers, OEMs, and system integrators to further drive commercial adoption and use in an increasing number of applications and end markets. To date, more than 300,000 TPS® and PBI MEAs have been sold (by us and others) for use in defense, micro-combined heat and power (µCHP) systems, battery range extenders for fuel cell battery hybrid vehicles, remote power for telecom and auxiliary power in remote locations, demonstrating strong early-stage adoption of our existing product line. To date, we have shipped thousands of systems for defense, off-grid and remote/portable power markets.
 
As our business ramps up to mass-production, we plan to pursue a revenue model that includes engineering fees, MEA sales and hardware-technology licensing fees through the life of product development. Our customer relationship is split into two phases: 1) partner with OEMs to co-develop customized fuel cell systems based on our MEAs, for which we earn engineering and licensing fees, and 2) produce and sell proprietary MEAs directly to OEMs while earning licensing fees on fuel cells produced by customers using our technology. We expect high-margin licensing fees to become a larger component of our revenue mix over time as our customers scale to mass manufacturing of fuel cells and other products.
 
We were founded and are managed by a team of world-class electrochemists, material scientists, and fuel cell specialists with significant industry and manufacturing expertise. We have received numerous R&D funds from the DoE and the European Union and are considered a pioneer with years of experience in clean energy technology innovation. We have our headquarters and a production facility in Boston, Massachusetts and operations in California, Greece, Germany, Denmark, and the Philippines. In 2023, we opened our production facility in Boston, Massachusetts offering research and development facilities and additional production capacity. For additional capacity, we intend to utilize existing U.S.-based toll-manufacturing for the membrane and electrode production to scale-up its production levels without significant capital expenditure. Our Patras, Greece based production of membranes, electrodes, and MEAs benefits from labor cost and skill availability advantages.
 
We intend to direct the majority of our near-term funding requirements to operating expenses and capital expenses for product development and plan to make substantial investments over the next several years, among others, in new production equipment and warehousing, systems assembly line, MEA assembly automation, aeronautical stacks and U.S. facility expansion.

UltraCell
 
On February 18, 2021, we acquired UltraCell, formerly a fuel cell division of Bren-Tronics, Inc. Prior to the acquisition, we had a mutually beneficial partnership, having worked together for several years. UltraCell is a leader in lightweight fuel cells for the portable power market, including small-scale fuel cell technology for the defense industry, and has sold thousands of battery pack charger systems built around Advent MEAs to four NATO militaries, including those of the U.S. and the U.K. UltraCell systems have been deployed with excellent performance in stringent and challenging conditions and climates. UltraCell’s technology uses hydrogen or liquid fuels to deliver reliable power at a fraction of the weight of batteries. Traditional LT-PEM fuel cell technology cannot be used in this type of remote environment fuel cell product due to the issues with compressed high-purity hydrogen. Our fuel flexibility allows for the use of methanol in its fuel cell application, which is stable in liquid form, cheaper, and more accessible than hydrogen. With our technology powering UltraCell products like the “Honey Badger”, a portable fuel cell which is in advanced testing with the U.S. military, multi-day military missions that generally required over 100 pounds of batteries can substitute a fuel cell and methanol canister with a total weight of 25 pounds. UltraCell’s fuel cell innovations are expected to complement the development of our next-generation lightweight systems for the mobility market, with an emphasis on the commercial drone, aviation, and heavy-duty automotive industries. UltraCell produces the only made in the U.S. NATO approved fuel cell products and is one of only two manufacturers of NATO approved fuel cell products manufacturing in a NATO country. Since the acquisition, we have retained current UltraCell operations in the Livermore, California area, in parallel to its Boston operations, and plan to continue to do so, with the possibility of expansion in the future.
 
SerEnergy and FES
 
On September 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition (the “Fischer Acquisition”) of SerEnergy and FES from F.E.R. fischer Edelstahlrohre GmbH (“Fischer”). SerEnergy and FES currently market and build standalone systems and critical fuel cell components. These products are complementary to the mobile systems produced by Advent. The Fischer Acquisition is well aligned to the “Any Fuel. Anywhere.” strategy, and is expected to accelerate our growing revenue base in fuel cell stacks and systems. The Fischer Acquisition also increased our patent and trademark portfolio with new intellectual property and increased our labor force by approximately 90 employees, many of whom are highly-skilled manufacturing and sales professionals experienced in the fuel cell industry. SerEnergy has deployed hundreds of standalone telecom remote self-maintaining power systems, including sales to Smart Communications, a leading telecommunications provider in the Philippines. These systems can operate in both high humidity and high temperature environments and offer remote monitoring. We believe that the combined HT-PEM fuel cell production capacity and operations in international markets, currently consisting of Germany, Denmark and the Philippines, will support our expansion into international customer segments, in particular the Asian and European markets.
 
Specific Product Offerings
 
Honey Badger: The Reformed Methanol Wearable Fuel Cell Power System, or “Honey Badger” is an offering marketed by our subsidiary UltraCell. On June 7, 2021, the U.S. DoD, through the U.S. Army DEVCOM Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center, with funding through the Project Manager Integrated Visual Augmentation System (PM IVAS), has entered into a contract with us to complete the MIL-STD certification of the cutting edge “Honey Badger”. “Honey Badger” is placed on a soldier worn plate carrier and provides on the move battery charging in the field. It has been selected by the DoD’s National Defense Center for Energy and Environment (NDCEE) to take part in its 2021 demonstration/validation program and is the only fuel cell to take part in this program. The NDCEE is a DoD program that addresses high-priority environmental, safety, occupational health, and energy technological challenges that are demonstrated and validated at active installations for military application. The product is offered at 20W and 50W power versions, and both are in testing and certification stages. Its core technology has completed successful field trials in Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiments and high-altitude tests in California’s Sierra Nevada. UltraCell’s “Honey Badger 50” (the 50W power version) fuel cell is the only fuel cell that is part of this program that supports the U.S. Army’s goal of having a technology-enabled force by 2028.
 
On August 4, 2022, we announced the launch of our HB50 power system, a compact portable fuel cell system and quiet power supply for use in off-grid field applications such as military and rescue operations. The launch of Advent’s portable power system coincided with the Company’s fulfilment of its first shipment order from the U.S. Department of Defense. The HB50 power system can be fueled by biodegradable methanol, allowing near silent generation of up to 50W of continuous power with clean emissions. Designed for covert operations, HB50 can easily power radio and satellite communications gear, remote fixed and mobile surveillance systems, and laptop computers along with more general battery charging needs. HB50 is a unique technology that can provide 65% of weight savings versus batteries over a typical 72-hour mission. The weight savings benefit increases further for longer missions.

HB50’s unique design allows it to be used in soldier-worn configurations or operated inside a portable backpack or vehicle while charging batteries and powering soldier systems, while its thermal features allow it to operate within an ambient temperature range of -20°C to +55°C. Aside from its optimized compatibility with Integrated Visual Augmentation System (“IVAS”), HB50 can also power devices such as high frequency radios like the model 117G, as well as B-GAN and StarLink terminals. HB50’s durability allows it to be easily deployed in challenging conditions and climates while supporting mission mobility for three to seven days without the need to re-supply.
 
Since Honey Badger’s fuel cell technology can run on hydrogen or liquid fuels, the system can operate at a fraction of the weight of traditional military-grade batteries to meet the U.S. Department of Defense’s continuously evolving needs for ‘on-the-go’ electronics needs. As military adoption and use of IVAS equipment continues to evolve, the highly portable lightweight power solutions like Honey Badger and HB50 will become a mission critical necessity.
 
SereneU: Our line of Serene solutions includes the core SereneU unit which is a 5kW fourth generation methanol powered hydrogen fuel cell that can be configured and/or stacked to meet energy needs up to 250kW. The SereneU is based on our proprietary MEA and HT-PEM, which together not only allow for higher efficiency and performance in extreme temperatures, but also for a lower total cost of ownership and start-up time, while offering true fuel flexibility. There are currently more than 1,000 SereneU based installations worldwide serving multiple purposes, covering the need for reliable green power from telecom towers and emergency networks as well as industrial and marine based requirements.
 
M-ZERØ: Our M-ZERØ line of products are designed to generate power in remote environments. Their use significantly reduces methane emissions where they replace older, less efficient technology. The current M-ZERØ products are 50W and 150W systems, with systems featuring up to 400W of power expected to be released by the end of 2022. We have entered into agreements to trial ten 50W systems in Canada starting in the third quarter of 2021. If the trials are successful, this could result in mass deployment of M-ZERØ systems during 2023. The products, which are not expected to require extensive servicing or refueling schedules, can work throughout the year, including in extreme cold. Traditional green remote power options of solar plus battery storage do not function well in either extreme cold or in hard-to-reach areas. Widespread adoption of M-ZERØ technology at all of the wellheads in the U.S. and Canada will result in a substantial reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.
 
Important Projects of Common European Interest (“IPCEI”)
 
Green HiPo: On June 16, 2022, we announced the receipt of a notification from the Greek State informing the Company that the IPCEI Green HiPo was submitted for ratification by the EU for funding of €782.1 million, spread over the six years. On July 15, 2022, we received official ratification from the European Commission of the EU. Green HiPo is an IPCEI which will allow us to develop, design, and manufacture fully scalable HT-PEM fuel cells and electrolysers for the production of power and green hydrogen, respectively.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property portfolio covers among other things: membranes, electrodes, MEAs, and systems exploiting the unique operating characteristics of its materials. In general, our employees are party to agreements providing that all inventions, whether patented or not, made or conceived while being an Advent employee, which are related to or result from work or research that the Company performs, will remain our sole and exclusive property.
 
We have been issued, acquired, licensed, or applied for approximately 200 international patents (including the intellectual property from the Fischer Acquisition), the vast majority in membranes, electrodes, and MEAs, which support our product offerings. Additionally, we have approximately eighteen trademarks registered with the USPTO and various international trademark offices, with additional trademark applications pending.
 
Competition
 
The market for alternative fuel and energy storage systems is still in the early stages of growth and is characterized by well-established battery and LT-PEM products. We believe the principal competitive factors in the markets in which it operates include, but are not limited to, the size, weight, lifetime, durability, and total cost of ownership of these systems to the end-user. We believe that our HT-PEM technology competes with these other technologies across a number of new and existing applications in the alternative energy fuel market, especially in the realm of fuel flexibility and heat management. We believe the total addressable market opportunity could be over $72 billion by the year 2030.
