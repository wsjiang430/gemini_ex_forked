ITEM 1. BUSINESS



The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this Report.



As used in this Report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms “C-Bond Systems, Inc.,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to C-Bond Systems, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, C-Bond Systems, LLC, and its 80% owned subsidiary, Mobile Tint, LLC, as the context may require.



Overview



We are a materials development company and sole owner, developer, and manufacturer of the patented C-Bond technology. We are engaged in the implementation of proprietary nanotechnology applications and processes to enhance properties of strength, functionality, and sustainability of brittle material systems. Our primary focus is in the multi-billion-dollar glass and window film industry with target markets in the United States and internationally. Additionally, we have expanded our product line to include disinfection products. We operate in two divisions: C-Bond Transportation Solutions and Patriot Glass Solutions. C-Bond Transportation Solutions sells a windshield strengthening, water repellent solution called C-Bond nanoShield™ as well as disinfection products. Patriot Glass Solutions sells multi-purpose glass strengthening primer and window film mounting solutions, including C-Bond BRS, a ballistic-resistant film system, and C-Bond Secure, a forced entry system.



On June 30, 2021, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Exchange Agreement”) with (i) Mobile Tint LLC, a Texas limited liability company doing business as A1 Glass Coating (“Mobile”), (ii) the sole member of Mobile (the “Mobile Shareholder”), and (iii) Michael Wanke as the Representative of the Mobile Shareholder. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, C-Bond agreed to acquire 80% of Mobile’s units, representing 80% of Mobile’s issued and outstanding capital stock (the “Mobile Shares”). On July 22, 2021, we closed the Exchange Agreement and acquired 80% of the Mobile Shares. Mobile provides quality window tint solutions for auto, home, and business owners across Texas, specializing in automotive window tinting, residential window film, and commercial window film that stop harmful UV rays from passing through its window films for reduced glare, comfortable temperatures, and lower energy bills. Mobile also carries products that offer forced-entry protection and films that protect glass from scratches, graffiti, other types of vandalism, and even bullets, including C-Bond BRS and C-Bond Secure products.



We expect that our recent acquisition of Mobile will be the springboard to provide glass security solutions across the United States. We recently launched Patriot Glass Solutions to protect personal and business property across the United States using C-Bond’s proprietary glass strengthening technology to protect property from looting, rioting, break-ins, and gunfire. With our recent acquisition of Mobile, we are re-branding our Safety Solutions Group as “Patriot Glass Solutions.” Patriot Glass Solutions’ primary products include C-Bond BRS, a ballistic-resistant film system; and C-Bond Secure, a multi-purpose glass strengthening primer and window film mounting solution that deters forced entry.

Disinfectant Products



On May 20, 2020, we entered into a two-year Distributor Agreement with an entity where we were appointed as a distributor to exclusively sell MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets for use in certain markets. In February 2022, we and the entity amended the Distributor Agreement to include the sale of Vimoba Tablets in those same markets and extended the term of the Distributor Agreement for another year. MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets are the most convenient way yet to deliver the benefits of chlorine dioxide to hygiene or biosafety programs. MB-10 disinfectant tablets have one of the broadest, most complete EPA registration labels on the market. It is a safe, easy, and effective way to disinfect a vehicle’s interior using an EPA registered disinfectant (Reg No.70060-19-46269) included on List N for use against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It is proven effective against emerging viral pathogens, including enveloped and large and small non-enveloped viruses. MB-10 Tablets provide fast-acting virus and bacteria protection that is safe for all vehicle surfaces including LED screens and electronics without leaving a residue or odor. Vimoba Tablets are 100% non-corrosive, chlorine dioxide producing tablets that maintain the exact same efficacy, EPA Label claims, dilution rates and contact times as MB-10 Tablets, while including a buffering agent that makes the Vimoba solution completely non-corrosive on stainless steel – even after prolonged use or exposure – and even when the solution dries on the surface. We were appointed as a distributor to exclusively sell MB-10 Disinfectant Tablets and Vimoba Tablets for use in the following markets:

● | Automotive, Trucking, RV, rental agencies (auto and truck), service vehicles (taxi, Uber, Lyft), mass transit (train, buses), golf carts, aviation, train, marine (potential future growth)

Patriot Glass Solutions



C-Bond Secure Strengthening Primer and Window Film Mounting Solution



C-Bond Secure is a patented, non-toxic, water-based nanotechnology solution designed to significantly increase the strength of architectural glass and improve the performance properties of window film-to-glass products. C-Bond Secure improves the performance of window film-to-glass products by reducing glass breakage from impact and stress environments and filling the capillary voids on the glass surface to prevent the trapping of moisture and impurities that impede cure time and adhesion between the glass and any succeeding window film product. This is important because when glass does break, this nanotechnology improves the chances that no large shards/pieces will escape the immediate area of the glass surface and result in serious laceration or personal injury.  C-Bond Secure has been tested against untreated glass by third-party laboratories and shown to outperform untreated glass in this capacity.  C-Bond Secure faces market competition from basic soap and water products (such as baby shampoo and dishwashing soap) as the recognized industry standard window film application solutions, which we believe provide no structural benefits and are designed to wash hair and dishes, respectively. C-Bond Secure increases overall glass strength, improves window film product performance, and can be used in conjunction with any manufacturer’s film product.



C-Bond BRS (Ballistic-Resistant Film System)



C-Bond BRS is a patented, nanotechnology Ballistic-Resistant Film System that increases the structural integrity of glass and provides National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level I, Level II, Level IIA, and Underwriter Laboratories (UL) 752 ballistic-resistant protection. C-Bond BRS includes a specified glass thickness and glass type, the C-Bond window film mounting solution to improve the glass mechanical strength, and the C-Bond window film product. This product is targeted to police, fire, emergency services, media outlets, schools, airports, and government buildings due to the utility of ballistic-resistant glass protection in their respective fields. The C-Bond BRS system seeks to combine simplicity and affordability with a one-way capability (the ability to shoot-out but prevent shooting in) ballistic protection compared to other costlier ballistic resistant material (polycarbonate and glass laminate) products.



Commercial Market Strategy



We utilize a distributor model to reach potential customers. This approach takes advantage of existing resources and facilitates relationships between us and our enterprise partners to leverage their collective strengths. We require industry partners to generate economic growth, support commercialization activities, provide more developed business networks, knowledge of and access to supply and demand channels, and supplement limited financial resources. We and our industrial partners work together to determine scalability, adaptability, affordability, usability and intellectual property. From a business perspective, the long-term scope and strategic benefits of our plug and play business strategy are to be able to carry out business on a global basis at a lower cost and be better informed and more adaptive to changing market conditions, which is dependent on securing these relationships.

C-Bond Authorized Distributor Network


Our Authorized Distributor Program focuses on channeling distribution agreements with industry specific business-to-business and original equipment manufacturing customers to develop a global distribution network. This program aims to partner with high quality distributors that can grow revenues and margins. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no customer accounted for over 10% of total sales. For the year ended December 31, 2022, all sales were in the United States. Almost all sales generated through Mobile are performed in Texas. No other geographical area accounted for more than 10% of total sales during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. A reduction in sales from or loss of our customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
Suppliers



Currently, we rely on two main suppliers, Madico, Inc. and Eastman Performance Films, LLC, for our window film; one main supplier, Gelest, Inc., for our chemicals; and one main supplier, Quip Laboratories, for disinfectant products.  However, we believe that, if necessary, alternate window film and chemical suppliers could be found without material disruption to our business.
Intellectual Property



To date, we have filed, licensed and/or acquired a total of 23 individual patents and patent applications spanning core and strategic nano-technology applications and processes. We intend to continue to expand our patent coverage. Our focus remains on building a patent portfolio that protects our core intellectual property and delivers shareholder value.



We own four provisional United States patents and licenses, seven United States patents, and 12 foreign patents on a non-exclusive basis from William Marsh Rice University (“Rice University”) with claims directed toward various aspects of our current products and products under development including the use of nanotechnology for glass strengthening and the processes and composition of our products.



Pursuant to an agreement dated April 8, 2016, between us and Rice University, Rice University has granted a non-exclusive license to us, in nanotube-based surface treatment for strengthening glass and related materials under Rice’s intellectual property rights, to use, make, distribute, offer and sell the licensed products specified in the agreement. In consideration, we had to pay a one-time non-refundable license fee of $10,000 and royalty payments of 5% of net sales of the licensed products during the term of the agreement and a sell-off period of 180 days from termination. In addition, we are required to pay for the maintenance of the patents.  This agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed property rights, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement. To date, no royalties have been due under this agreement.

Research and Development



We did not incur any research and development expenses during 2022.



Competition



C-Bond nanoshield Windshield Performance System



We believe we have no direct competition in the windshield glass strengthening space.



C-Bond nanoShield also provides a complementary hydrophobic or water repellent quality. There are competitors in this space, including Rain-X, AquaPel, and Diamon-Fusion. We believe these products do not provide chip or crack resistance and have hydrophobic properties that degrade sooner than C-Bond nanoShield. Accordingly, management believes there is no product that is truly comparable to C-Bond nanoShield currently on the market.  We had the performance of C-Bond nanoShield verified at our request, based on a modified chip test for paint on metal parts, SAEJ 400, to provide windshield glass chip protection when compared to untreated glass.

C-Bond Secure Glass Strengthening Primer and Window Film Mounting Solution



C-Bond Secure faces competition from alternative window film mounting products in the market; however, all these products have similar ingredients to a soap and water mix, which we believe provides no structural benefit.  These solutions are used to provide a window film installer the ability to slip or move the film on the surface to which it is applied.  The industry standard solution most commonly used to apply window film to glass is a mixture containing commonly available baby shampoo or dishwashing soap and water that we believe has the following negative attributes: provides no structural benefits, often bubbles or yellows and scatters light, can only be applied within a limited temperature range, and may require 30 to 120 days of “dry” time to set completely depending on the film thickness.  C-Bond Secure provides the same slip properties while also strengthening the glass and improving film adhesion.



C-Bond BRS



C-Bond BRS faces competition from alternative bulletproof or bullet-resistant glass products in the market. Alternative bulletproof solutions use polycarbonate or glass laminate materials that are expensive, thick, heavy, often require reframing and retrofit of existing structure and revised building codes, and yellow and discolor over time.  These alternative solutions are often cost prohibitive to cost sensitive customers such as educational and municipal facilities.  C-Bond BRS allows for increased safety and security at an affordable cost.  Most importantly, it provides a deterrent to an intruder and valuable time to secure the facility.



Employees



As of December 31, 2022, C-Bond had one full-time employee, and multiple part-time employees, including our chief executive officer, who operate as independent contractors of the Company. Additionally, Mobile had 16 full-time employees and 3 independent contractors. We have established an extensive network of external partners, contractors, and consultants to minimize administrative overhead and maximize efficiency.



We believe that a diverse workforce is important to our success. We will continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations, and to cultivate an inclusive and diverse corporate culture. In the future, we intend to continue to evaluate our use of human capital measures or objectives in managing our business such as the factors we employ or seek to employ in the development, attraction and retention of personnel and maintenance of diversity in our workforce.



The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.



We also provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and have not experienced any labor disputes.
