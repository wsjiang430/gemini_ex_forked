 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the next evolution in cellular medicine by developing off-the-shelf placental-derived allogeneic cell therapies for the treatment of cancer and immune and infectious diseases. We are developing a pipeline of off-the-shelf placental-derived allogeneic cell therapy product candidates including T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, natural killer, or NK, cells, mesenchymal-like adherent stromal cells, or MLASCs, and exosomes. These therapeutic candidates target indications across cancer, infectious and degenerative diseases. We believe that by harnessing the placenta’s unique biology and ready availability, we will be able to develop therapeutic solutions that address a significant unmet global need for effective, accessible and affordable therapeutics. We also actively develop and market biomaterial products derived from the placenta. Prior to 2023, we marketed those products domestically primarily serving the orthopedic and wound care markets. We now intend to market placental biomaterials outside of the United States with an initial focus on markets in the Middle East and North Africa. Our biomaterials business today is comprised primarily of the sale of our Biovance and Interfyl products, directly or through our distribution network. Biovance is decellularized, dehydrated human amniotic membrane derived from the placenta of a healthy, full-term pregnancy. It is an intact, natural extracellular matrix that provides a foundation for the wound regeneration process and acts as a scaffold for restoration of functional tissue. Interfyl is human connective tissue matrix derived from the placenta of a healthy, full-term pregnancy. It is used by a variety of medical specialists to fill soft tissue deficits resulting from wounds, trauma, or surgery. We are developing new placental biomaterial products to deepen the commercial pipeline beyond Biovance and Interfyl. We also plan to leverage our core expertise in cellular therapeutic development and manufacturing to generate revenues by providing contract manufacturing and development services to third parties. The initial focus of this new service offering will be to assist development stage cell therapy companies with the development and manufacturing of their therapeutic candidates for clinical trials. In January 2023, we announced reprioritization of efforts which resulted in a reduction of approximately one-third of our workforce as of March 2023.
Our Celularity IMPACT platform capitalizes on the benefits of placenta-derived cells to target multiple diseases, and provides seamless integration, from bio sourcing through manufacturing cryopreserved and packaged allogeneic cells, in our purpose-built U.S.-based 147,215 square foot facility. We believe the use of placental-derived cells, sourced from the placentas of full-term healthy informed consent donors, has potential inherent advantages, from a scientific and an economic perspective. First, relative to adult-derived cells, placental-derived cells demonstrate greater stemness, meaning the ability to expand and persist. Second, placental-derived cells are immunologically naïve, meaning the cells have never been exposed to a specific antigen, and suggesting the potential for less toxicity and for low or no graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, in transplant. Third, our placental-derived cells are allogeneic, meaning they are intended for use in any patient, as compared to autologous cells, which are derived from an individual patient for that patient’s sole use. We believe this is a key difference that will enable readily available off-the-shelf treatments that can be delivered faster, more reliably, at greater scale and to more patients.
 From a single source material, the postpartum human placenta, we derive five allogeneic cell or extracellular vesicle types: T cells, unmodified NK cells, genetically modified NK cells, MLASCs and exosomes, which are used in seven key cell therapeutic programs—CYCART-19, CYCART-201, CYNK-001, CYNK-301, CYNK-302, APPL-001, and pEXO-001. CYCART-19 is a placental-derived CAR-T cell therapy, in development for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, initially targeting the cluster of differentiation 19, or CD19, receptor, the construct and related CARs for which are in-licensed from Sorrento. In the first quarter of 2022, we submitted an IND to investigate CYCART-19 for treatment of B-cell malignancies and in late May 2022, received formal written communication from FDA requesting additional information before we can proceed with the planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We are in the process of working with the FDA in an effort to resolve its questions as promptly as possible. We expect to commence the trial, if the IND is cleared by FDA, and sufficient funding is available, in second half of 2023. We will also progress CYCART-201, our genetically modified T-cell expressing CD16 with a T-cell receptor, or TCR, knockout in combination with monoclonocal antibodies, or mAbs, in non-Hodkin's lymphoma, or NHL, and in solid tumors. CYNK-001 is a placental-derived unmodified NK cell. In 2022, we had active and approved clinical trials under development for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, a blood cancer, and for glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, a solid tumor cancer. CYNK-001 is currently in an active Phase 1 trial for AML. We will also advance CYNK-301 as our next generation CAR-NK that has the potential to overcome some of the challenges faced by NK therapies in treating relapse refractory AML, or rrAML. Due to a need to prioritize corporate resources, in January 2023 we announced our intention to cease recruitment in the GBM trial. We will however, continue to advance our solid tumor research programs. CYNK-302 is a next generation CAR-NK being developed in solid tumors with an initial focus on non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, an area of continued high unmet need. APPL-001 is a placenta-derived MLASC being developed for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, and other degenerative diseases. pExo-001 is placenta-derived exosome being developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis.
 Our Celularity IMPACT manufacturing process is a seamless, fully integrated process designed to optimize speed and scalability from the sourcing of placentas from full-term healthy informed consent donors through the use of proprietary processing methods, cell


selection, product-specific chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, advanced cell manufacturing and cryopreservation. The result is a suite of allogeneic inventory-ready, on demand placental-derived cell therapy products. We also operate and manage a commercial biobanking business that includes the collection, processing and cryogenic storage of certain birth byproducts for third-parties.
 Our current science is the product of the cumulative background and effort over two decades of our seasoned and experienced management team. We have our roots in Anthrogenesis Corporation, or Anthrogenesis, a company founded under the name Lifebank in 1998 by Robert J. Hariri, M.D., Ph.D., our founder and Chief Executive Officer, and acquired in 2002 by Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. The team continued to hone their expertise in the field of placental-derived technology at Celgene through August 2017, when we acquired Anthrogenesis. We have a robust global intellectual property portfolio comprised of over 1,500 patents and patent applications protecting our Celularity IMPACT platform, our processes, technologies and current key cell therapy programs. We believe this know-how, expertise and intellectual property will drive the rapid development and, if approved, commercialization of these potentially lifesaving therapies for patients with unmet medical needs.
 Our Pipeline
 Leveraging our Celularity IMPACT platform, we have four placental-derived allogeneic cell types: T cells, or pT, unmodified NK cells (CYNK-001), genetically modified NK cells (CYNK-301, CYNK-302) and MLASCs. We are also researching a placenta-derived adherent cell exosome, or pEXO.
While we continue to prosecute the Phase 1 trial of CYNK-001 in minimal residual disease positive, or MRD+ve, and rrAML, we are also progressing our next generation modified NK platform in both rrAML and solid tumors.
CYNK-301 is a next generation CAR-NK that has the potential to overcome some of the challenges faced by NK therapies in treating rrAML including minimizing the burden of lymphodepletion, while optimizing proliferation, persistence and efficacy. CYNK-301 incorporates membrane bound Interleukin 15, or IL15, to enhance NK cell activation, proliferation and persistence, with additionally, marrow homing and a targeted CAR to further enhance efficacy.
CYNK-302 is a CAR-NK being developed in solid tumors with an initial focus on NSCLC, an area of continued high unmet need. CYNK-302 is a next-generation construct building on our learning from CYNK-101. It is genetically modified to express CD16 and is further enhanced by incorporating membrane bound IL15 and an undisclosed targeted CAR.
We continue to progress our CYCART-19 program towards clinical trials and continue to develop our T-Cell platform with potentially first-in-class or best-in class constructs. CYCART-201 is designed for use in combination with multiple potential mAbs with broad therapeutic potential. CYCART-201 is genetically modified to express CD16 with a TCR knockout. Our initial hematological development will be in NHL and our solid tumor development in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive, or HER2+ve, tumors, both in combination with targeted mAbs.
Following a strategic review, we have refocused on the development of our autoimmune and degenerative disease assets. APPL-01 is a genetically modified MLASC which is being initially investigated in Crohn’s disease, or CD, in order to build on the encouraging signals seen in our previous trials of unmodified MLASC in CD. We will continue to progress pEXO in osteoarthritis which continues to have significant unmet need and market potential.

 Further, we are looking to expand our pipeline of placentally derived biomaterial products.
 
Celularity IMPACT Platform
 Placental-derived cell therapies offer potentially lifesaving therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. We have developed and acquired proprietary technology for collecting, processing and storing placental stem cells with potentially broad therapeutic applications across cancer, infectious and degenerative diseases.
 We use our proprietary Celularity IMPACT platform for the development of Immuno-Modulatory Placenta-derived Allogeneic Cell Therapies. We believe that by harnessing the placenta’s unique biology and ready availability, we will be able to develop therapeutic solutions that address a significant unmet global need for effective, accessible and affordable therapeutics.
 Our Celularity IMPACT manufacturing process is a seamless, fully integrated process that is built to optimize speed and scale from sourcing of human full term healthy postpartum donated placentas through proprietary processing methods, cell selection,


product-specific CMC, advanced cell manufacturing and cryopreservation and result in allogeneic inventory-ready and on demand placental-derived cell therapy products. The fully integrated process is housed in our purpose-built manufacturing, translational research and biobanking facility.
 Our Celularity IMPACT platform capitalizes on our integrated processes and the unique biologic characteristics of placenta-derived allogeneic cells to target multiple diseases including indications across cancer, infectious and degenerative diseases. The platform is designed to accelerate the speed at which therapies can be provided to patients while ensuring manufacturing excellence of high quality and pure placental-derived cell therapy products at a lower cost of revenues. We believe cell therapy inventory should be available to physicians on demand to treat patients in need and to enable repeat dosing regimens that other cell therapy platforms will not be able to support.
 
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to lead the next evolution in cellular medicine by delivering off-the-shelf allogeneic cellular therapies, at greater scale and quality with attractive economics. We believe achieving this goal will result in placental-derived allogeneic cell therapies becoming a standard of care in various indications across cancer, infectious and degenerative diseases, and enable us to make potentially lifesaving therapies more readily accessible to more patients throughout the world. We plan to achieve this mission by:
 •Leveraging the inherent advantages of placental-derived cells. Our cells come from the postpartum placenta donated by healthy donors who have signed an informed consent, representing a renewable, economical and highly scalable starting material collected under rigorous controls. We use those cells to produce on-demand, off-the-shelf investigational allogeneic cellular therapy products investigational medicines that are designed to sidestep treatment delays inherent to more costly autologous cell therapies and other allogeneic cell therapy approaches, all while offering the potential for greater in vivo expansion, persistence, potency and acceptance. Further, we believe the immunological naïveté of placental cells may allow for potentially less toxicity.
 •Capturing efficiencies through our integrated Celularity IMPACT platform. Manufacturing allogeneic cell therapeutic candidates involves a series of complex and precise steps. We believe a critical component to our success will be to leverage our rapidly scalable, end-to-end supply chain. Applying proprietary manufacturing know-how, expertise and capacity utilizing our purpose-built U.S.-based current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, compliant facility, we believe our fully integrated manufacturing operations and infrastructure will allow us to improve the manufacturing process, eliminate reliance on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and more rapidly advance therapeutic candidates. We also plan to leverage this core expertise to generate revenues by providing contract manufacturing and development services to third parties.
 •Selectively targeting indications with unmet patient need with potential for accelerated development. Our pipeline reflects our intent to leverage the unique biology of the placenta to develop placental-derived allogeneic cells for indications where the demonstrated properties of such cells could provide an advantage, both in terms of development (sourcing and 
 

proliferation) and potential efficacy (affinity). In selecting indications, we evaluate where the biological properties of placental-derived cells position them for success, as well as where there is a clearly defined regulatory pathway providing the potential for accelerated development to address unmet patient need.
 •Growing our existing commercial business and deepening the pipeline of placentally derived biomaterial products. We intend to grow our existing commercial business both through higher volumes of product sold through existing domestic distribution relationships as well as initiate new distribution relationships outside of the United States. Our initial efforts to grow outside the United States will focus on distribution relationships in the Middle East and North Africa. We are continuing to invest in new biomaterials programs, some or all of which may require different regulatory pathways than Section 361 HCT/Ps. We are currently developing a tendon wrap indicated for the management and protection of tendon injuries in which there has been no substantial loss of tendon tissue. We are also developing a bone void filler product for use in orthopedic surgical markets. We have preliminary data from a knee osteoarthritis animal model that placentally derived extracellular matrix may decrease joint pain and promote chondrogenesis in damaged cartilage.
 •Continuing to invest in basic and translational research. We intend to continue to invest in the discovery and development of additional pipeline cell franchises and explore other placental-derived cell opportunities. Preclinical and early clinical data demonstrating the unique biological activity and potential of placental-derived stem cells, provide potential for multiple highly effective cell therapy programs.
 •Benefiting from collective experience of deep, seasoned management team. We have a deep, seasoned management team with experience in all aspects of cellular medicine, including discovery and translational research, clinical development and product approval, manufacturing and process development and commercialization. For over two decades, the team has been at the vanguard of cellular medicine, and has collectively seen a number of programs, including one cell therapy, through FDA-approval to commercialization.
 Our Team and Corporate History
 Anthrogenesis Corporation
 We have our roots in Anthrogenesis, a corporation founded under the name Lifebank in 1998 by Robert J. Hariri, M.D., Ph.D., our founder and Chief Executive Officer. Like us, Anthrogenesis was focused on developing and delivering cellular therapies using placental-derived stem cells for the treatment of cancers, degenerative and infectious diseases. Celgene acquired Anthrogenesis in December 2002 in a stock-for-stock merger, and operated Anthrogenesis as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, or CCT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene. Similarly, CCT continued to focus on the research and development of placental-derived stem cells. In 2016, Dr. Hariri formed Celularity and began acquiring the assets that form our business today. These include our degenerative disease and biobanking businesses, which Celgene had sold to Human Longevity, Inc., or HLI, a genomic-based health intelligence company co-founded by Dr. Hariri and Dr. Diamandis, one of our directors, as well as our core cellular therapeutics business, which we acquired in August 2017, when we acquired Anthrogenesis from Celgene in exchange for stock and event-driven contingent value rights, or CVRs.
Celgene Corporation (acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb)
 License Agreement
 In August 2017, in connection with the Anthrogenesis acquisition, we entered into a license agreement with Celgene. Pursuant to the license with Celgene, we granted Celgene a worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid up, non-exclusive license under Anthrogenesis’ intellectual property in existence as of the date of the Celgene license or as developed by Celgene in connection with any transition services activities related to the merger for preclinical research purposes, as well as to develop, manufacture, commercialize and fully exploit products and services that relate to the construction of any CAR, the modification of any T-cell or NK cell to express such a CAR, and/or the use of such CARs or T-cells or NK cells for any purpose, which commercial license is sublicensable. Either party may terminate the Celgene license upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or insolvency of the other party.
Contingent Value Rights
 In August 2017, in connection with the Anthrogenesis acquisition, we issued shares of our Series X Preferred Stock to Celgene as merger consideration and entered into the contingent value agreement with Celgene, or the CVR Agreement. Pursuant to the CVR Agreement, we issued one CVR in respect of each share of Series X Preferred Stock issued to Celgene in the acquisition. Such CVRs are not separable from the shares of Series X Preferred Stock other than in an initial public offering or a sale of our company.
The CVR Agreement entitles the holders of the CVRs to an aggregate amount, on a per program basis, of $50 million in regulatory milestones and an aggregate $125 million in commercial milestone payments with respect to certain of our investigational therapeutic programs, which would include the current CYNK-001, CYNK-101 and PDA-002 pipeline candidates and the legacy PDA-001 program


(a placenta-derived adherent cells, proprietary to Anthrogenesis, that is formulated for intravenous delivery) that are no longer in development. Such payments under the CVR Agreement also expressly cover PNK-007 (which includes certain NK cells proprietary to Anthrogenesis, produced by a process proprietary to Anthrogenesis as of the closing of the Anthrogenesis transaction) and certain PNK-007 cells with a genetic modification (but not including NK cells with a chimeric receptor, including a CAR), along with any derivatives, parts, subparts, or progeny of any of the foregoing, or any therapeutic based or derived (in whole or in part) on certain related development programs as they existed as of the closing of the Anthrogenesis transaction. Accordingly, as we expand our NK cell type franchise into new indications and, as a general matter, because these payments are not payable until a later stage of development, we expect to continue to evaluate our present and future therapeutic candidates as they develop and evolve in light of the specific terms in the CVR Agreement to determine the specific therapeutics on which such amounts will be payable. In addition, with respect to each such program and calendar year, the CVR holders will be entitled to receive a royalty equal to a mid-teen percentage of the annual net sales for such program’s therapeutics from the date of the first commercial sale of such program’s therapeutic in a particular country until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire of any valid patent claim covering such program therapeutic in such country, the expiration of marketing exclusivity with respect to such therapeutic in such country, and August 2027 (i.e., the tenth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of Anthrogenesis). No payments under the CVR Agreement have been made to date.
 Investors’ Rights Agreement and Investment Rights Agreement
 We also entered into an investors’ rights agreement and an investment rights agreement, each with Celgene and certain other parties thereto in August 2017 in connection with the Anthrogenesis acquisition. For more information regarding these agreements, see Item 13 “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence — License and Other Agreements” of this annual report.
Allogeneic Placental-Derived Cells
 Biomaterials Collection
 The initial source material for our four allogeneic cell types is the postpartum human placenta. We source human placental birth material used for the manufacture of our products from accredited hospitals and birth centers, with collections performed by licensed health care professionals. Eligibility for donation is determined by a donor screening process that includes education about the donor program, obtaining informed consent from the donor and completion of a detailed maternal health questionnaire and family health history. These forms are completed by the donor, with assistance from trained collection technicians as needed. Donors providing birth materials do not encounter any fees and are not renumerated.
Licensed health care professionals collect donor material utilizing our proprietary collection kits, which include barcode labels for biomaterials (cord blood, placenta and maternal blood samples) along with appropriate chain of custody documentation. Once collected, the donated material and a maternal blood sample are shipped in an insulated container via courier to our Florham Park, New Jersey laboratory and manufacturing facility.
 Upon arrival at our facility, the donated material is reviewed for labeling completeness and accuracy of the barcoded kit and is electronically coded into a validated software database. If all quality criteria are met, the donated material is then individually evaluated and forwarded to the appropriate production suite for processing and manufacturing. We believe that our sourcing is rapidly scalable due to numerous established procurement relationships that provide a constant renewable supply to meet current and future manufacturing needs.
 Unique Biology of Placenta-Derived Cells
 Placental-derived cells have unique biology related to immunological naïveté, stemness, persistence and proliferation that makes them a biologically preferred starting material with the potential for less toxicity and superior biological activity relative to adult bone marrow or peripheral blood-derived cells.
 Research has shown that the human placenta is a novel and valuable source of multipotential stem/progenitor cells of mesenchymal and hematopoietic origin, which have multiple therapeutic applications. Our characterization data show that approximately one to five percent of placental-derived cells are CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, among which expression of certain markers suggests that such HSCs have more self-renewal capacity and the potential to facilitate the early engraftment of the placental-derived cells. In addition, further characterization has shown low T-cell content and immature T subpopulations. This demonstrated immunological naïveté further suggests the potential for low or no graft vs host disease, or GvHD, in transplant. Furthermore, mesenchymal-like cells have been shown to possess other characteristics, capabilities and effects (e.g., osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic differentiation capabilities and immunomodulatory effects). The high quantity of mesenchymal-like cells and Treg cells indicate that placental-derived cells can potentially contribute to prevention of GvHD and host microenvironment modulation. In summary, we believe the stemness,


potential capacity of proliferation and persistence of placental-derived cells support multiple potential therapeutic applications, including those in development by us.
 We are also researching placental-derived exosomes for potential therapeutic applications. Exosomes are a kind of extracellular vesicle that act as communication channels between cells and cause functional changes in recipient cells. Exosomes enable intercellular communication by transferring specific cargo contents to a recipient cell and can confer epigenetic changes in the recipient cells by delivering microRNAs, or miRNAs. Exosomes have been identified as the primary factors responsible for paracrine effects detected in all types of stem cells and for the transfer of genetic material from stem cells to the tissue-specific cell that needs regeneration. Exosomes have been shown to possess powerful regenerative potential, including immune-modulatory properties and anti-inflammatory properties. We discovered a type of exosome that we call pEXO. Rich in growth factors, deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, fragments, miRNAs, and messenger RNAs, pEXO exhibit particular markers that distinguish them from other exosomes that are not derived from placenta-derived adherent cells. We are investigating purified pEXO formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for human administration to promote angiogenesis and/or vascularization, to modulate immune activity and to repair tissue damage.
 Overview of CAR-T Cells
 White blood cells are a component of the immune system and responsible for defending the body against infectious pathogens and other foreign material. T cells are a type of white blood cell and are involved in both sensing and killing infected or abnormal cells, including cancer cells, as well as coordinating the activation of other cells in an immune response.
 Unlike adult peripheral blood mononuclear cell, or PBMC, derived T cells, placental-derived T cells are mostly naïve and can be readily expanded while maintaining an earlier differentiation phenotype, such as greater expression of naïve/memory markers and lower expression of effector/exhaustion markers. These characteristics allow for greater proliferative potential of these cells ex vivo. Placental-derived T cells are also known to have greater immune tolerance and display impaired allogeneic activation, contributing to lower incidences of severe GvHD, which makes them an attractive cell population for use as an allogeneic, adoptive cell therapy. We have developed a robust process for the isolation, transduction and expansion of placental-derived T cells to generate “off-the-shelf” allogeneic CAR-T cells.
 Allogeneic human placental T cells are derived from healthy donor placentas. We separate out mononuclear cells using a mononuclear cell separation method to isolate placental T cells prior to cryopreservation. Our allogeneic CAR-T cell product begins with the thawing and activation of the isolated placental T cells, followed by viral transduction of the cancer-targeting CAR construct and an additional genetic modification step to minimize any risk of GvHD. Once transduced and transfected, the CAR-T cells are expanded to yield large quantities of these cells prior to harvest, final formulation and cryopreservation of the cellular therapeutic.
 Overview of NK cells — Unmodified and Genetically Modified
 NK cells are potent effector cells of the innate immune system responsible for identifying and eliminating abnormal and stressed host cells. They are equipped with NK cell-specific activating receptors that recognize conserved antigens induced by cellular stress while being simultaneously tuned with inhibitory receptors to avoid mistakenly targeting healthy cells. NK cells are particularly relevant in combating viral infections and mediating anti-tumor immunity in which normal cellular processes are stressed for the purposes of perpetuating viral infection and cancer cell proliferation.
 Commercializing NK cell therapies has been limited by the difficulty and cost to scale the production of mature NK cells for clinical dosing. Utilizing our Celularity IMPACT platform, our proprietary process has mitigated these limitations by expanding and differentiating placental-derived stem cells into NK cells over a period of 35 days. We derive the HSCs from healthy donor placentas, then propagate and differentiate these cells into NK cells. This process can produce hundreds of doses per donor placenta. We also developed technologies that can achieve high genetic modification efficiency by transducing placenta HSCs and producing downstream stable gene modified CYNK cells with enhanced cancer killing activities. These cells are then cryopreserved and available to be shipped upon request.
 For our genetically modified NK cells, our allogeneic modified NK cell product begins with the thawing and activation of the isolated placental NK cells. We then use a lentiviral vector transduction to augment the effector functions of the NK cells and to sustain their tumor-killing properties. We believe that our genetically modified NK cells can be used in combination with therapeutic mAbs to boost antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, potential.
 Overview of MLASCs
 Placental-derived MLASCs are a novel, culture-expanded mesenchymal-like cell population derived from placental tissue. In vivo, we demonstrated that MLASCs’ immune-modulatory properties alleviate autoimmunity and possess anti-inflammatory activity. Both intravenous and intramuscular administration formulations of the first generation of MLASCs have been developed and investigated in


clinical studies in Crohn’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, stroke, diabetic foot ulcers and diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We are developing next generation genetically modified MLASCs for the treatment of degenerative diseases.
 Allogeneic human placental MLASCs are derived from healthy donor placentas. Our allogeneic MLASC product begins with the thawing and activation of the isolated placental-derived MLASCs, followed by genetic modification of tissue factor to reduce potential toxicities and lower risk of adverse effects. Once modified, we expand the MLASCs to large quantities prior to harvest, final formulation and cryopreservation of the cellular therapeutic.
 Overview of Exosomes
 Exosomes are acellular, nano-size lipid bilayer membrane particles released by cells into extracellular space and play important roles in cell to cell, tissue to tissue and organ to organ communications. Exosomes are generated from late endosomes with 30-200 nanometers in diameter. When fused with the targeted cells, the molecular cargos (proteins, lipids, DNAs, mRNAs, and microRNAs) exosomes carry are inserted into the cells to exert the functions.
Recently, exosomes are being recognized as promising candidates in the treatment of degenerative diseases. Evidence has suggested that part of the observed cell therapeutic effects is mediated by exosomes. Exosome therapy has certain advantages over cell therapy such as: low/non-immunogenicity, easy storage, and administration. In addition, due to their nano-size, exosomes can cross the brain-blood barrier and can be delivered to broader target tissues and organs than cell-based therapeutics.
 pExo-001 is a human postpartum placenta derived exosome product which consists of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that have been reported to have regenerative and immuno-regulatory activities.
Allogeneic Cell Therapies — an “Off-the-Shelf” Approach
 There are two primary approaches to engineered cell therapies: autologous and allogeneic. Autologous therapies use engineered cells derived from the individual patient, while allogeneic therapies use cells derived from an unrelated third-party healthy donor. We believe our human placental-derived allogeneic platform is leading the next evolution of cellular medicine because we aim to deliver off-the-shelf allogeneic cellular therapies, at greater scale and quality with attractive economics, potentially making lifesaving therapies more readily accessible to more patients throughout the world.
 Our human placenta-derived allogeneic platform currently includes placental CAR-T cells (CYCART-19 and CYCART-201), NK cells (CYNK-001, CYNK-301 and CYNK-302), MLASCs (APPL-001) and exosomes (pEXO-001).
 CYCART
 Currently, autologous CAR-T products are manufactured by isolating T cells from the patient’s blood through a process known as leukapheresis. The cancer-targeting construct expressing specific CAR proteins is virally transduced into the T cells and the engineered T cells are then propagated until a sufficient number are available for infusion. The engineered T cells are then shipped back to the clinical center for administration to the patient. The process from leukapheresis to delivery to the clinical center takes approximately four weeks. While the autologous approach has been revolutionary, demonstrating compelling efficacy in many patients, we are burdened by lengthy vein-to-vein time, high production cost, variable potency and manufacturing failures.
 Conversely, our allogeneic placental-derived T cells are derived from healthy donors that have undergone rigorous donor screening and selection. Manufactured drug product can be deployed to patients immediately in sufficient quantities because administration is not limited by patient cell sourcing and individual drug product expansion. As an “off-the-shelf” treatment, CYCART cells also offer the potential to re-dose patients, if necessary. Healthy births are in hundreds of millions worldwide, and the placenta provides an abundant, renewable source of healthy, ready to use lymphocytes. In addition, placental-derived T cells contain an abundance of stem cell memory T cells, which confer high proliferation and durability. Placental T cells are known to be immune-privileged and have low donor to host toxicity (GvHD). We are therefore potentially a generally safer cell population. Furthermore, allogeneic placental T cells can be genetically engineered to minimize the risk of GvHD and avoid being destroyed by the patient’s immune system. Therefore, CYCART cells may possess an advantageous safety profile while delivering effective tumor eradication activity and durable persistence in patients.
 CYNK
 Similarly, autologous NK cells and genetically modified autologous NK cells have been used in the setting of immuno-oncology. NK cells can directly kill cancer cells by recognizing signals of cellular stress and carry no risk of GvHD. However, autologous peripheral blood derived NK cells have limited proliferation capacity and usually require leukemia cell line-based technology to assist production. In addition, autologous CAR-NK was shown to encounter technical challenges due to low transduction efficiency of CAR vectors in the peripheral NK cells. Our NK platform propagates placenta derived HSCs and differentiates these cells into NK cells (CYNK). This process can produce hundreds of doses per placenta donor. We have also developed technologies that can achieve high


genetic modification efficiency by transducing placenta HSCs and produce downstream stable gene modified CYNK cells with enhanced cancer killing activities. These cells are then frozen and can be shipped to clinical administration immediately upon request.
 MLASCs
 Both autologous and allogeneic bone marrow or adipose tissue derived MLASCs have been used in human clinical trials. Autologous MLASC therapies have advantages including the absence of donor cell related adverse events and fewer regulatory hurdles since cell products are derived from a donor’s own cells. However, autologous MLASC products carry the inherited or aging-related biological defects from the donor, which may impair therapeutic value. Furthermore, in most cases, autologous cells still require cultivation before patient administration and there is a risk of manufacturing failure.
 Conversely, allogeneic MLASCs can provide an off-the-shelf product with high quality and flexibility of dosing. MLASCs are regarded as immune-privileged due to their relative low-level major histocompatibility complex class I and II protein expression. Our placenta tissue derived MLASCs are potentially more immune privileged due to their fetal origin. In addition, because APPL cells have higher proliferative capability, they are expected to be more suitable for genetic manipulations to engineer the cells to have specific features to enhance their functions or to mitigate risk factors.
 Therapeutic Candidate Pipeline and Development Strategy
 We are researching and developing multiple placental-derived allogeneic cellular therapeutic candidates for the treatment of indications across cancer, infectious and degenerative diseases. From a single source material, the placenta, we focus on four allogeneic cell types: CAR-T cells, unmodified NK cells, genetically modified NK cells, and MLASCs. We are also researching pEXO. Our product pipeline is represented in the diagram below:
 
CYCART-19
 Our lead therapeutic program based on our placental-derived CAR-T cell is CYCART-19, an allogeneic CAR-T cell targeting the CD19 receptor. We are granted certain rights related to the CD19 receptor construct and associated CARs utilized in CYCART-19 in the field of placenta-derived cells and/or cord blood-derived cells from Sorrento, a significant stockholder. For a description of the terms of the Sorrento license and our rights outside the field of placenta-derived cells and/or cord blood-derived cells, see the section entitled “Licensing Agreements — Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.”.
 All currently FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapies, and an estimated approximately 75% of clinical assets in development, are autologous. Autologous therapies mean the peripheral blood-derived T-cell is the immune cell vehicle used to express a CAR, making the patient their own donor. Manufacturing these autologous CAR-T cell therapies is complex and costly, with a long vein-to-vein time that, can affect therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, multiple rounds of lymphocyte depleting therapies cause inconsistent apheresis cell recovery in relapsed or refractory patients. We believe that our placental-derived CAR-T cell, CYCART-19, is a scalable solution because it does not have apheresis capacity constraints is designed to be manufactured at high volume, and is delivered as an on-demand,


off-the-shelf, cryopreserved packaged product. Further, placental-derived cells contain an abundance of stem cell memory cells, which confers greater proliferative potential and increased persistence in vivo.
 Preclinical Data
 In preclinical studies, placental-derived T cells, which constitute the starting material for CYCART-19, were demonstrated to consist mostly of naïve/T stem cell memory cells, or T scm, with a small proportion of central memory T cells. Following genetic modification and proliferation/expansion in the laboratory, CYCART-19 cells expressed high levels of naïve/memory markers and low levels of the immune inhibitory molecule PD-1. Furthermore, CYCART-19 cells maintained a higher proportion of T scm, as compared to PBMC-derived CD19 CAR+ T cells, which signifies greater self-renewal, proliferative potential, lymphoid homing and increased ability to persist in vivo.
 



In vitro, CYCART-19 cells specifically lysed CD19+ targets Daudi (Burkitt’s Lymphoma) and Nalm6 (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) cell lines and secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector proteins in response to these CD19+ targets.
 












As shown in the preceding graphics, in mice models, CYCART-19 demonstrated superior anti-lymphoma activities and survival, indicating greater activity, persistence and prolonged immune attack upon tumor recharging as compared to adult-blood derived CD19 CAR-T cells. CYCART-19 eliminated tumor and resulted in 100% survival out to 120 days. CYCART-19 “memory” characteristics were demonstrated via extended survival out to 215 days upon tumor rechallenge on day 122, longer persistence, and greater lymphoid homing to the spleen at end of study to elicit prolonged antitumor activities. CYCART-19 cells used in animal studies were not T-cell receptor α constant knockout, or TRAC KO, modified.
Placental-derived T cells are unique in that they can contribute to reduced alloreactivity responses and can be associated with lower incidences and severity of GvHD. As shown in the following graphic, expanded placental-derived T cells did not induce xenogeneic GvHD in in vivo mice models. This is evidenced by 100% survival, no weight loss, no increase in detection of any human CD3+ T cells in treated mice. PBMC-treated mice exhibited significant weight loss, death of all mice and increase of detection of human CD3+ T cells at day 28.
 

Despite the lack of evidence of GvHD with expanded placental-derived T cells, we do include a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR, mediated T cell receptor alpha constant, or TRAC, knock-out, or KO, step in our process as a


further risk mitigation strategy to prevent GvHD. CYCART-19 transfected cells achieved 97-99% TRAC KO efficiency and demonstrated a loss of functional T cell receptor via lack of response (proliferation) to anti-CD3 restimulation.
 


Planned Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
We plan to evaluate CYCART-19 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies (targeting the CD19 receptor) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
 

The planned Phase 1 trial will evaluate safety and dosing and will include three dose cohorts (40, 120 and 360 x 106 transduced, viable CAR-T cells), in a 3x3 trial design, and will enroll up to 18 patients. The primary endpoint is to determine safety and maximum tolerated dose. Secondary endpoints are overall response rate, or ORR, (the sum of complete responses and partial responses, or CR+PR), duration of response, or DOR, progression-free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, or OS. We also intend to explore the persistence of CYCART-19.
 The planned Phase 2 trial will evaluate efficacy of CYCART-19 and enroll 198 patients. The primary endpoint is to determine ORR (CR+PR). Secondary endpoints are safety, time to response, DOR, PFS and OS. We also intend to explore the persistence of CYCART-19.
 In the first quarter of 2022, we submitted an IND to investigate CYCART-19 for treatment of B-cell malignancies and in late May 2022, received formal written communication from FDA requesting additional information before we can proceed with the planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We are in the process of working with the FDA in an effort to resolve its questions as promptly as possible. We expect to commence the trial, if the IND is cleared by the FDA, and sufficient funding is available, in second half of 2023. There is no assurance the IND will be allowed to proceed, will be allowed to proceed on the time frame contemplated or that the studies will be permitted to begin in the anticipated time frame.
 CYCART-201
 CYCART-201 is genetically modified T-cell expressing CD16 with a TCR knockout. CYCART-201 is designed for use in combination with multiple potential mAbs with broad therapeutic potential. Our initial hematological development will be in NHL and our solid tumor development in HER2+ve tumors, both in combination with targeted mAbs.
CYNK-001
 Our lead therapeutic program based on our placental-derived unmodified NK cell type is CYNK-001, an allogeneic unmodified NK cell being developed as a treatment for AML.
 AML is the second most common type of leukemia in adults and children comprising about one-third of all adult leukemia cases. While most patients respond well to induction chemotherapy and achieve complete remission, two-thirds will relapse after frontline therapy. Patients who experience relapse following standard therapy (Relapsed/Refractory-R/R AML) and those that achieve a complete response but have residual measurable residual disease (MRD+ AML) have poor outcomes and remain an unmet medical need for new therapies. We are evaluating CYNK-001 administered to AML patients with either R/R AML or MRD+ AML. We seek to determine if CYNK-001 following the standard of care could further reduce AML burden in R/R AML and/or MRD+ AML potentially to below measurable residual disease (<0.1%) and if this translates to a clinical benefit that could lead to a registration trial.
Preclinical Data
 Preclinical studies of CYNK-001 showed evidence of significant killing against chronic myeloid leukemia, or ML, AML and MM, cell lines and primary AML samples. CYNK-001 activation released high concentration of IFN-g, a cytokine favoring Th1 anti-tumor responses, and CYNK-001 exerted up to 60% specific lysis against primary AML samples at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 3:1.
 





•Single or repeated dose of CYNK-001 significantly reduced bioluminescence imaging, or BLI, signal on D25, 28 and 35 compared with phosphate-buffered saline control
 •Repeated dose significantly reduced BLI signal on D25, 28 and 35 compared with CYNK-001 single dose
 Phase 1 Trial
 We have completed a Phase 1 dose escalation trial that enrolled 11 relapsed/refractory AML patients, treating 10 with a single dose of PNK-007, a prior formulation of CYNK-001 that was not cryopreserved. The cell therapy was generally well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities, no GvHD, and no detectable HLA allo-antibody. Eight of 10 patients were efficacy evaluable (two were not due to inadequate bone marrow for evaluation) and two of four of these patients treated with the highest dose (approximately 700 million NK cells) had evidence of a transient biologic effect.
 We are currently enrolling a follow-up Phase 1 trial for CYNK-001, the cryopreserved NK cell formulation equivalent of PNK-007, in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and patients in hematologic remission with minimal residual disease, or MRD. As part of the CYNK-001 Phase 1 trial, we assessed dosing of lymphodepletion to maintain serum IL-15 levels above baseline and T regulatory cells at low levels for up to 28 days, or Window of dosing opportunity, to potentially enhance potency and persistence of NK cells. In total, 16 patients have been enrolled and treated with R/R AML and ten patients with MRD+ AML and there have been no dose limiting toxicities observed at any dose level to date including total dose levels of 1.8, 3.6 and 5.4 billion CYNK-001 cells. There has been the achievement of MRD negative status at highest CYNK-001 cell dose level with documented persistence of CYNK-001 cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood at 28 days post Day 0 Infusion. To potentially further enhance CYNK-001 potency and persistence, the expansion arms in MRD and R/R AML use an augmented lymphodepletion protocol of Cytoxan 3600 mg divided over four days (versus prior 900 mg divided over three days) and fludarabine 120 mg divided over four days (versus prior 75 mg divided over three days) to increase post lymphodepletion IL-15 levels. Management will evaluate a potential path for the remainder of the AML study after review of the trial to date results including the 6B cohort. In December 2021, we received fast track designation from the FDA for CYNK-001 for the treatment of AML.
 In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 dose escalation trial in recurrent GBM of intravenous and intra-tumoral bed CYNK-001 cells to evaluate dose, NK cell homing and persistence, safety, and biologic effect. We received fast track designation from the FDA for CYNK-001 for the treatment of recurrent GBM in March 2021 and received orphan drug designation from the FDA for CYNK-001 for the treatment of GBM in April 2021. Due to a need to prioritize corporate resources, in January 2023, we announced our intention to cease recruitment in the GBM trial.
CYNK-301
Building on our experience in AML, CYNK-301 is our next generation CAR-NK that has the potential to overcome some of the challenges faced by NK therapies in treating rrAML including minimizing the burden of lymphodepletion, while optimizing proliferation, persistence and efficacy. CYNK-301 incorporates membrane bound IL15 to enhance NK cell activation, proliferation and persistence, with additionally, marrow homing and a targeted CAR to further enhance efficacy.


CYNK-302
CYNK-302 is a CAR-NK being developed in solid tumors with an initial focus on NSCLC, an area of continued high unmet need. CYNK-302 is a next-generation construct building on our learning from CYNK-101 in HER2+ve gastric cancer. It is an optimized construct which is genetically modified to express CD16 as a universal engager and is further enhanced by incorporating membrane bound IL15 to support proliferation and persistence and an undisclosed targeted CAR to further enhance efficacy.
APPL-001
 The current lead therapeutic candidate from our placental-derived MLASC type is APPL-001, a genetically modified placental-derived MLASC. We are initially evaluating APPL-001 for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. In clinical studies of unmodified MLASCs, over 50 patients were dosed with MLASCs for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. Clinical response rates were significantly higher in treatment groups compared with the placebo group.
 Phase 1/2a Trial Design
 The planned Phase 1/2a trial will evaluate APPL-001 in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease who are refractory to corticosteroids. The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability and to establish recommended Phase 2 dose. The primary objective in the planned Phase 2a part of the trial will be evaluation of clinical activity by measuring clinical remission and clinical response in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. Secondary objectives are to assess disease modifying measures such as endoscopic measurements and quality of life assessments. The planned primary endpoint is clinical remission/response at six weeks and after one year. Planned secondary endpoints include evaluation of mucosal healing, and patient-reported outcome of quality of life as measured by Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire.
 
pEXO-001
 pExo-001 is a human postpartum placenta derived exosome product which consists of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that have been reported to have regenerative and immuno-regulatory activities. The initial development of pExo-001 will be in osteoarthritis.
 Future Pipeline Opportunities
 We plan to utilize our Celularity IMPACT platform to pursue additional targets of interest. These include the additional indications for the four allogeneic cell types currently in the pipeline as well as other targets that might be validated in the future. Our placental-derived T cell platform has potential to target other receptors.
 In addition, we regularly survey the scientific and industry landscape for opportunities to license, partner or acquire technologies that may help us advance current or new cell therapies for the benefit of patients.
 Our ability to prosecute future opportunities including those with scientific and potential commercial merit may be influenced by our ability to raise sufficient capital to pursue those opportunities or to find commercial partners that are willing and able to fund portions of their development. Co-developed or partnered programs may have longer term economics that are less favorable than internally funded programs, but those programs also may have higher odds of success with a well capitalized development partner with specific expertise in the disease state under investigation.
 Commercial Businesses
 We are continuing to invest in new biomaterials programs to expand our pipeline of placentally derived biomaterial products. We are currently developing a tendon wrap indicated for the management and protection of tendon injuries in which there has been no substantial loss of tendon tissue. We are also developing a bone void filler product for use in orthopedic surgical markets. We have


preliminary data from a knee osteoarthritis animal model that placentally derived extracellular matrix may decrease joint pain and promote chondrogenesis in damaged cartilage. Our product pipeline is represented in the diagram below:
 
Degenerative Diseases
 We report our operating results including a segment we call Degenerative Disease. The National Cancer Institute defines “degenerative disease” as a disease in which the function or structure of the affected tissues or organs changes for the worse over time. Our degenerative disease business today is comprised primarily of the sale of our Biovance and Interfyl products, directly or through our distribution network. Biovance is decellularized, dehydrated human amniotic membrane derived from the placenta of a healthy, full-term pregnancy. It is an intact, natural extracellular matrix that provides a foundation for the wound regeneration process and acts as a scaffold for restoration of functional tissue. Interfyl is human connective tissue matrix derived from the placenta of a healthy, full-term pregnancy. It is used by a variety of medical specialists to fill soft tissue deficits resulting from wounds, trauma, or surgery. We are investigating additional biomaterial products for use in treating degenerative diseases as well as applications in degenerative diseases for our proprietary cell therapies and possible combination therapies that use of a biomaterial or biomaterials in combination with a cell therapy. Biovance and Interfyl were developed at Anthrogenesis prior to the Celgene acquisition and sold to HLI by Celgene, and then acquired by us from HLI in May 2017, subject to marketing and distribution rights licensed by HLI to a third party, which rights were acquired by us in May 2018, along with the MIST and UltraMIST Therapy Systems. In August 2020, we entered into a five-year licensing arrangement with Sanuwave Health Inc., or Sanuwave that included: (i) an exclusive Biovance license for distribution and commercialization in the wound care market and (ii) a non-exclusive license for the distribution and commercialization of Interfyl in the wound care market worldwide, except certain Asian jurisdictions, pursuant to which we were to receive royalties based on minimum sales thresholds. The license agreement with Sanuwave was terminated during the third quarter of 2021 due to an uncured material breach.
 We have focused our marketing and sales strategy within the Degenerative Disease segment on developing strong distribution partners for our products rather than building out our own direct sales force. On May 7, 2021, we entered into a six-year supply and distribution agreement with Arthrex, Inc., that includes: (i) an exclusive Biovance, Interfyl, and Centaflex license for distribution and commercialization within the United States in the field of orthopedic surgery; and (ii) an exclusive license to commercialize and distribute Interfyl and Centaflex within the United States in the field of acute and chronic non-healing wound care. On September 1, 2021, we entered into a three-year supply and distribution agreement with Evolution Biologyx, LLC that includes an exclusive license to commercialize and distribute Interfyl in the United States within any medical specialty where Interfyl is administered in an in-office or in-patient setting and is reimbursed through Medicare Part B or any successor, equivalent or similar category established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Center for Medicare Services or other government authority, except in the medical specialty of orthopedic surgery excluding trauma or spine applications in the medical specialty or orthopedic or neurologic surgery.
 During January 2023, we announced two new distribution agreements related to our expansion outside of the United States into the Middle East and North Africa. We entered into an exclusive territory distribution agreement with CH Trading Group LLC, or CH Trading Group, an international import, export and trading company. CH Trading Group will act as the exclusive territories distributor of our Halal-Certified products within more than 100 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Further, we announced an exclusive


distribution agreement with the Tamer Group, or Tamer, a Middle East healthcare distribution company, for the distribution of our branded biomaterial products in Saudi Arabia. During March 2023, we also announced we executed an exclusive distribution agreement with Abu Dhabi Ports Company, or AD Ports, a leading global facilitator of trade, logistics and industry based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, for the distribution of our biomaterial products in United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and Egypt.
We continue to invest in creating new or differentiated products for the Degenerative Disease segment to supplement sales of our mature commercial products, Biovance and Interfyl. We have created Biovance 3L, a trilayer human amniotic membrane product focused on the ocular and surgical markets. Biovance 3L is available in both sheet and disk form depending upon the application. We have also created CentaFlex, a decellularized human placental matrix derived from the umbilical cord. CentaFlex can be used as a surgical covering, wrap or barrier to protect and support the repair of damaged tissue. We have other products based on human placental tissue under development that may follow a variety of regulatory pathways to potentially achieve commercial readiness.
 Biobanking
 We provide a fee-based biobanking service to expectant parents who contract with the company to collect, process, cryogenically preserve and store certain biomaterial, including umbilical cord blood and placenta derived cells and tissue. We receive a one-time fee for the collection, processing and cryogenic preservation of the biomaterials, and a storage fee to maintain the biomaterials in our biobank payable annually generally over a period of 18 to 25 years. We acquired our biobanking business in May 2017 from HLI, which HLI operated as LifebankUSA, along with the degenerative disease products Biovance and Interfyl, and in October 2018, we acquired CariCord Inc., or CariCord, a family cord blood bank.
Manufacturing
 We have a 147,215 square foot purpose-built facility located in Florham Park, New Jersey, which includes a cGMP-ready manufacturing center, along with dedicated research and office spaces and space for shared services. Our facility includes nine Grade C/ISO-7 and six Grade D/ISO-8 manufacturing suites designed for commercial production of cellular therapies and advanced biomaterials. We intend to manufacture all finished product in-house at our manufacturing facility in Florham Park, New Jersey. We have invested resources to optimize our manufacturing process, including the development of improved analytical methods. We plan to continue to invest in process science, product characterization and manufacturing to improve our production and supply chain capabilities over time. We have also used CMOs, as needed, on a non-exclusive basis, and may use CMOs in the future, for certain of our therapeutic candidates. For example, we used a CMO for the clinical manufacture and supply of CYNK-001 through 2022 which we internalized the manufacture for and anticipate that all finished product will be manufactured in-house going forward. All other finished products are manufactured in-house. Notwithstanding, we will engage CMOs as necessary to ensure continuous supply of clinical and commercial grade product based on demands.
 Our cellular therapeutic candidates are designed and manufactured via a platform comprised of defined unit operations and technologies. The process is gradually developed from small to larger scales, incorporating compliant procedures to create cGMP conditions. Notwithstanding this platform-based model, each therapeutic is unique and for each new therapeutic candidate, a developmental phase is necessary to individually customize each engineering step and to create a robust procedure that can later be implemented in a cGMP environment to ensure the production of clinical batches. This work is performed in a research and development environment to evaluate and assess variability in each step of the process in order to define the most reliable production conditions.
 We plan to leverage our core expertise in cellular therapeutic development and manufacturing to generate revenues by providing contract manufacturing and development services to third parties. The initial focus of this new service offering will be to assist development stage cell therapy companies with the development and manufacturing of their therapeutic candidates for clinical trials. We believe that we will be able to provide a flexible and cost effective alternative to the larger contract manufacturing organizations currently serving this market.
 Licensing Agreements
 We enter into license agreements in the ordinary course of our business. We have in-licensed certain technology from Sorrento that is necessary to research and develop our CYCART-19 program. Because of the broad potential applicability of our placental-derived cellular therapeutic candidates, we may also out license our technology to third parties for development for other indications that we do not intend to pursue or for certain territories. For example, in June 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Lung Biotechnology PBC. Under that license agreement, which was terminated in March 2021, we granted Lung Biotechnology PBC an exclusive license to placental-derived stem cells in the field of pulmonary diseases and organ transplantation. We have also licensed rights to distribute our degenerative disease products, Biovance and Interfyl, to Sanuwave for a five-year period in connection with the August 2020 sale of other non-core assets, however we terminated this license in the third quarter of 2021.
Further, as part of the acquisition of Anthrogenesis from Celgene, we granted Celgene a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive license, to use certain intellectual property for both research and commercial purposes, and granted Celgene the CVRs,


which provide us the right to future milestone and royalty payments in certain circumstances. See the section entitled “— Our Team and Corporate History — Celgene Corporation” for a description of the ongoing relationship between us and Celgene, including the out license agreement and the CVRs.
 Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.
 In September 2020, we entered into a license and transfer agreement with Sorrento to obtain rights to Sorrento’s proprietary anti-CD19 CAR-T construct and associated CARs for use in placenta-derived or cord blood-derived cells. Sorrento is a significant stockholder of ours. We are using Sorrento’s technology to genetically modify our placental-derived T-cell to create the CAR T-cell with a CD19 receptor that is our CYCART-19 therapeutic candidate.
 Pursuant to the Sorrento Agreement, we obtained a worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses with Sorrento’s consent, under certain of Sorrento’s intellectual property rights, including patent rights that would be infringed by the use of certain CD19 CAR constructs, to research, develop, use, reproduce, modify, and create derivative works in the field of placenta-derived cells and/or cord blood-derived cells for the treatment of any disease or disorder, and to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, export, and distribute products for use in connection with our research, development, commercialization and exploitation of products combining Sorrento’s proprietary anti-CD19 CAR-T construct and associated CARs with placenta-derived or cord blood-derived cells. The foregoing license is exclusive with respect to a certain U.S. provisional patent application and non-exclusive with respect to all other licensed intellectual property rights of Sorrento.
 Sorrento reserves the right to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, export, and otherwise research, develop, commercialize and exploit CD19 CAR-T licensed products for use outside the field of placenta-derived cells and/or cord blood-derived cells for the treatment of any disease or disorder and any other products or services that are not CD19 CAR-T licensed products that use or incorporate any CD19 CAR-T constructs or associated CARs.
 Under the Sorrento Agreement, we have sole responsibility for the development and commercialization of licensed products, subject to certain reserved rights of Sorrento with respect to CD19 CAR-T products. We are currently negotiating a supply agreement with Sorrento to obtain the continued supply of CAR constructs and licensed products under the Sorrento Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products.
 Pursuant to the Sorrento Agreement, we have agreed to assign all right, title and interest in any improvements generated by us to Sorrento’s background intellectual property. Additionally, we have granted Sorrento a non-exclusive, sublicensable, fully paid-up, royalty free, worldwide license under any new inventions that relate to or cover CD19 CAR-T constructs generated by us under the Sorrento Agreement for use in connection with Sorrento’s reserved rights under CD19 CAR-T licensed products and constructs (as described above). Sorrento has the primary right to control the prosecution and maintenance of patents and patent applications arising out of or relating to the Sorrento Agreement, including any patents or patent applications covering the licensed products, while we have the secondary right to pick up prosecution of any such patents and patent applications abandoned by Sorrento.
 Under the Sorrento Agreement, we are obligated to pay Sorrento a low teens double digit percentage of non-royalty sublicensing income payments received by us in connection with a grant of any sublicense for CD19 CAR-T licensed products. Additionally, we are obligated to pay Sorrento a low single-digit royalty on net sales of CD19 CAR-T licensed products in perpetuity. We will also be obligated to pay Sorrento for the supply of the CAR constructs and licensed products pursuant to the supply agreement, once finalized, which we expect to be based on the cost plus a percentage, with no guaranteed minimums. As of December 31, 2022, we have not paid Sorrento any amounts under the Sorrento Agreement but have made payments for supply of products while continuing to negotiate the supply agreement.
 Either party may terminate the Sorrento Agreement upon an uncured material breach of the Sorrento Agreement by the other party. Additionally, after the first anniversary of the effective date of the Sorrento Agreement, we have the right to terminate the Sorrento Agreement at any time upon specified written notice to Sorrento. On February 13, 2023, Sorrento announced that it commenced voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. At this time, we cannot predict what impact the bankruptcy will have on Sorrento’s continued ability to perform under the license agreement.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for the technologies supporting our Celularity IMPACT platform, and our lead cellular therapeutic candidates, CYCART-19, CYNK-001, CYNK-101, APPL-001, PDA-002 and future therapeutic candidates, as well as novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know-how. Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to develop and maintain protection of our proprietary position by, among


other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and applications related to our technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
 We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, confidentiality agreements, and invention assignment agreements to develop and maintain our proprietary position. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and the invention assignment agreements are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed for us by our employees, consultants, or other third parties. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in our agreements and security measures, either may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors.
 With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial therapeutics and methods of using and manufacturing the same.
 We are actively building our intellectual property portfolio around our Celularity IMPACT platform, our four allogeneic cell types and our therapeutic candidates based on our own intellectual property as well as licensed intellectual property. We are the owner of, co-owner of, or the licensee of over 1,500 patents and patent applications in the United States and worldwide protecting our Celularity IMPACT platform, our processes, technologies and current key cell therapy programs.
 Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed toward our five allogeneic placental-derived cell and extracellular vesicle types: CAR-T cells, unmodified NK cells, genetically modified NK cells, MLASCs and exosomes as follows:
 •We have six utility patent families in the CAR-T technology area supporting our CYCART-19 and CYCART-201 therapeutic candidates comprising three patent families owned by us to support both CYCART-19 and CYCART-201 and three patent families licensed from Sorrento to support CYCART-19. These patent applications include licensed CAR-T patent families and owned placental-derived CAR-T patent families directed toward early CAR receptor technology, CAR receptor method and composition, anti-CD19 CAR receptor and product characterization. Patents issuing from these families have expected expiry dates ranging from 2039 to 2042 and include pending patent applications in the United States and under the PCT, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasian Patent Organization, European Patent Convention, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, and South Africa.
 •We have approximately 15 utility patent families owned by us in the NK technology area supporting our CYNK-001, CYNK-301 and CYNK-302 therapeutic candidates that include patents and patent applications covering process, treatment of indications, and product characterization. Patents issuing from these families have expected expiry dates ranging from 2028 to 2041 and include patents issued and pending patent applications in the United States and under the PCT, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Eurasian Patent Office, European Patent Office, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Russian Federation, Singapore, Taiwan R.O.C., Ukraine, Vietnam, and South Africa.
 •We have approximately 25 utility patent families owned by us in the MLASC technology area supporting our APPL-001 therapeutic candidate and former legacy MLASC candidates that include patents covering product characterization and method of production, as well as product description and indications. Patents issuing from these families have expected expiry dates ranging from 2023 to 2040 and include patents issued and pending patent applications in the United States and under the PCT, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Eurasian Patent Office, European Patent Office, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Russian Federation, Singapore, Taiwan R.O.C., Ukraine, Venezuela, Vietnam, and South Africa. Although patent families in this technology area began to expire in 2021, we have numerous patent families in this technology area directed to improvements in the cells and methods/indications for their use, which include recently filed applications directed towards APPL-001, a second generation, genetically modified MLASC therapeutic candidate. These applications have projected expiration dates to 2041 and are expected to replace the early-expiring applications. Accordingly, we do not expect that the expiry of the early-filed MLASC patents will have a material effect on our business.
 •We have four utility patent families in the exosome technology area supporting our placental exosome candidates. These patent applications include product characterization focused on identifying and protecting the key molecular markers that define these unique exosome populations and establish protection for their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties as well as for their use in the treatment of specific indications such as osteoarthritis. Patents issuing from these families have expected expiry dates ranging from 2035 to 2043 and include issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and under the PCT, Australia, Canada, China, Eurasian Patent Organization, European Patent Convention, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, and South Africa.
 

More generally, our patent portfolio and filing strategy is designed to provide multiple layers of protection by pursuing claims directed toward composition of matter, methods of making, and methods of use, amongst others. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking patent protection intended to cover our technology and related technologies and uses thereof.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. In the United States, patent term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for a patent term extension of up to five years under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which is designed to, among other things, compensate for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent term extension is calculated based on the length of time we take for regulatory review. A patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be restored. Moreover, a patent can only be restored once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, we can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
 Competition
 Our products will compete with novel therapies developed by biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, in addition to existing standard of care treatments.
 Due to the promising therapeutic effect of cell therapies in clinical trials, we anticipate increasing competition from existing and new companies developing these therapies, as well as in the development of allogeneic cell therapies.
 Potential cell therapy and biomaterials competitors include:
 •CYCART-19 and CYCART-201; allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies: Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Fate Therapeutics Inc. and Precision Biosciences, Inc.
 •CYNK-001, CYNK-301 and CYNK-302; allogeneic NK cell therapies: Fate Therapeutics Inc., Sanofi S.A. (acquired Kiadis Pharma N.V.), Century Therapeutics, Inc. and Nkarta, Inc.
 •APPL-001; allogeneic MLASC therapies: Mesoblast Limited.
 •pEXO-001; exosomes: Aegle Therapeutics Corporation, Capricor Therapeutics, Inc., Evox Therapeutics Ltd., and Organicell Regenerative Medicine, Inc.
 •Cell therapy competition: Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Adaptimmune Therapeutics PLC, Celyad S.A., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Poseida Therapeutics, Inc., Precision Biosciences, Inc. and Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.
 •Biomaterials competition: Mimedx Group, Inc., and Organogenesis Holdings Inc.
 Competition will also arise from non-cell-based therapies pursued by small-cap biotechnology and large-cap pharmaceutical companies including Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol Myers Squibb Company, Incyte Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG.
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing than we do. Future collaborations and mergers and acquisitions may result in further resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors.
 Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize therapeutics that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than cellular therapeutics that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make development efforts more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and convenience.
 These competitors may also vie for a similar pool of qualified scientific and management talent, sites and patient populations for clinical trials, as well as for technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our cell therapeutics will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our cellular therapeutics will need to occur in registered facilities in compliance with cGMP for biologics. The FDA categorizes human cell or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing authorization. Our cellular therapeutic candidates are considered more than minimally manipulated and will require evaluation in clinical trials and the submission and approval of a BLA before we can market them.
 Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our therapeutic candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 U.S. Product Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our operation and business. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
 Before testing any biological product candidate, including our cellular therapeutic candidates, in humans, the therapeutic candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product


chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight of institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs, as set forth in the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Under the NIH Guidelines, recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids are defined as: (i) molecules that are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and that can replicate in a living cell (i.e., recombinant nucleic acids); (ii) nucleic acid molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules (i.e., synthetic nucleic acids); or (iii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) or (ii). Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if we determine that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
 •Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring


and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Human cellular therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of cellular therapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA submission must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the therapeutic unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the therapeutic within required specifications. For cellular therapies, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
 In November 2017, the FDA released a guidance document entitled “Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue — Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use — Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff”, which it revised and reissued in July 2020, or the Guidance. The document confirmed the FDA’s stance that sheet forms of amniotic tissue are appropriately regulated as solely Section 361 HCT/Ps when manufactured in accordance with 21 CFR Part 1271 and intended for use as a barrier or covering. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based therapeutics are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Although FDA had indicated in its Guidance that the agency would exercise enforcement discretion under limited conditions with respect to the IND application and pre-market approval requirements for certain HCT/Ps, this period of enforcement discretion ended May 31, 2021.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a therapeutic receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the therapeutic. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved therapeutics that have been commercialized.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a therapeutic has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same therapeutic for the non-orphan indication(s).
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 If a therapeutic that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the therapeutic is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the therapeutic with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from


approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 In April 2021, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to our non-genetically modified cryopreserved human placental hematopoietic stem cell-derived NK cell therapy, CYNK-001, for the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has programs intended to facilitate and expedite the development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation. Specifically, new therapeutics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the therapeutic and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 Any therapeutic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a therapeutic with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A therapeutic is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed therapeutics. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new therapeutic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a therapeutic may be eligible for accelerated approval. Therapeutics studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies with due diligence and, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA currently requires, unless the sponsor is otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. In addition, breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of therapeutics that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation by the FDA requires preliminary clinical evidence that a therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other drugs and biologics, demonstrates substantial improvement over currently available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include (i) holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy, (ii) providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable, (iii) involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, (iv) assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor and (v) considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same product if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will expedite the development and review of such product.
 

Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 In March 2021, we received fast track designation from the FDA for our non-genetically modified cryopreserved human placental hematopoietic stem cell-derived NK cell therapy.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any therapeutics for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although a physician may prescribe a legally available product for an off-label use, if the physicians deems such product to be appropriate in his/her professional medical judgment, a manufacturer may not market or promote off-label uses. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. A company that is found to have promoted off-label use of its product may be subject to significant liability, including administrative, civil and criminal sanctions.
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products, and those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our therapeutics under development.
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its molecule as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. This 12-year period of data exclusivity may be extended by six months, for a total of 12.5 years, if pediatric exclusivity is granted. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial that fairly responds to an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of its U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved therapeutic is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent


and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond our current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 Federal and State Licenses and Registrations
 The health care industry is subject to stringent regulation by a wide range of authorities. Accordingly, our business requires us to maintain certain licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, approvals, certifications, accreditations and other types of federal, state, and local governmental permissions and to comply with various regulations in every jurisdiction in which we operate. For example, we are required to maintain licenses and registrations in several states, and has obtained biologics, tissue bank and blood bank licenses, permits and registrations in states where such licensure is required for us to market and support our products and services. Some states, such as New York, impose state law restrictions on products that have not been the subject of a BLA based upon their interpretation of guidance issued under federal law, including the FDA’s guidance on HCT/Ps, which can lead to different, and potentially conflicting, regulatory frameworks applicable to our degenerative disease products on a state by state basis. We also maintain an annual registration with the FDA as a tissue bank, and national accreditation by the American Association of Blood Banks. The failure to comply with such licensure requirements can result in enforcement actions, including the revocation or suspension of the licenses, registrations or accreditations, or subject us to plans of correction, monitoring, civil money penalties, civil injunctive action and/or criminal penalties.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our business practices, including our research and sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may be required to comply with the fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, false claims laws, anti-kickback and anti-bribery laws, the data privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, federal transparency requirements and similar state laws, each as amended.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Rather, if “one purpose” of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is violated. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have knowingly presented or caused to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, among others, a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Further, violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs.
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal government programs that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease


or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies are being investigated or, in the past, have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes requirements on certain types of individuals and entities, including covered entities (i.e., certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses), relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates (and their subcontractors) that are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
State laws also govern the privacy and security of personal information. Many state laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA establishes data privacy rights for individuals located in California, and imposes certain requirements on how businesses can collect and use personal information about such individuals. The California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which became effective on January 1, 2023, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information and establishes a state agency vested with the authority to enforce the CCPA. It is not yet fully clear how the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA) will be enforced and how it will be interpreted. The evolving nature of the CCPA may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.
The CCPA (as amended by the CPRA) has prompted the enactment of similar, comprehensive privacy and data protection legislation in other states, such as Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut, which will all become effective in 2023. Furthermore, a number of other U.S. states have proposed similar privacy and data protection legislation, and it is possible that certain of these proposals will pass. Although many of the existing state privacy laws exempt clinical trial information and health information governed by HIPAA, future privacy and data protection laws may be broader in scope. Further, the proliferation of state privacy laws has heightened risks and uncertainties concerning our collection and use of personal information. This could lead to significant compliance costs and expenses on our business, increase our potential exposure to regulatory enforcement and/or litigation and have a negative effect on our ability to attract and retain new customers.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information to CMS related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, applicable manufacturers were also required to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse-midwives.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to


maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. In order to distribute therapeutics commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states and local jurisdictions have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs and comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any therapeutic candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and certain markets in other countries, sales of any therapeutics for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or from establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our therapeutics, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our therapeutic candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Net prices for our therapeutics may also be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a therapeutic does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the therapeutic. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in therapeutic development.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, or EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular therapeutic candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more


recent requirements in the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.
 The marketability of any therapeutic candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. For example, actions by federal and state governments and health plans may put additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and health care costs, which could negatively impact coverage and reimbursement for our products if approved, our revenue, and our ability to compete with other marketed products and to recoup the costs of our research and development. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more therapeutics for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of therapeutic candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell therapeutic candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 For example, the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the Affordable Care Act provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
 •an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
 •an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP);
 •a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
 •extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
 •expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
 •expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
 •a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
 •expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
 •a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
 •requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
 •a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
 

•establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and
 •a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
 There remains executive, legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, in December 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax, was signed into law. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective January 2019, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision an Executive Order was issued to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation on the United States healthcare industry is unclear.
 Previously, in October 2017, an Executive Order was signed terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. The former administration concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the Affordable Care Act have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California in October 2017. In August 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in two separate cases that the federal government is liable for the full amount of unpaid CSRs for the years preceding and including 2017. For CSR claims made by health insurance companies for years 2018 and later, further litigation will be required to determine the amounts due, if any. Further, in June 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in Affordable Care Act risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. In April 2020, the United States Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, concluding the government has an obligation to pay these risk corridor payments under the relevant formula.
 We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved therapeutic, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our therapeutics. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from therapeutic candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop therapeutic candidates.
 Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Then, a 1% payment reduction occurred beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022. Further, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. At the federal level, an Executive Order was signed in July 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices,


imposing inflation caps and supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, to enhance the domestic drug supply chain, to reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and to address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations in September 2020, which went into effect in November 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, in November 2020, CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. In December 2021, CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nation rule. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our therapeutic candidates. Additionally, in December 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. In December 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 2026. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, further delayed implementation of this rule to January 2032.
In August 2022, the IRA was signed into law. The IRA includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that create a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D pricing for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. The effect of IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Executive branch may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the current administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our therapeutics. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a therapeutic, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the therapeutic in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a Market Authorization Application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of therapeutics, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 225 full-time employees and 35 non-employee leased workers. Of these employees, 41 held Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 35 were engaged in research, 12 were engaged in clinical development and 89 were engaged in technical operations. Substantially all of our employees are located in Florham Park, New Jersey. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In January 2023, we announced reprioritization of efforts which resulted in a reduction of approximately one-third of our workforce as of March 2023.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants, and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
