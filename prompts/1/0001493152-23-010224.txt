Item 1. Business.
Our Company
 
We are a diversified holding company principally engaged through our subsidiaries in the development of EHome communities and other real estate, financial services, digital transformation technologies, biohealth activities and consumer products with operations in the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea. We manage our three principal businesses primarily through our 85.4% owned subsidiary, Alset International Limited (“Alset International”), a public company traded on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Through this subsidiary (and indirectly, through other public and private U.S. and Asian subsidiaries), we are actively developing real estate projects near Houston, Texas and in Frederick, Maryland, in our real estate segment. Recently, the Company expanded its real estate portfolio to single family rental homes, and we currently own 132 homes that are rented or are available for rent. In our digital transformation technology segment we focus on serving business-to-business (B2B) needs in e-commerce, collaboration and social networking functions. Our biohealth segment includes sale of consumer products. We identify global businesses for acquisition, incubation and corporate advisory services, primarily related to our operating business segments.
 
We also have ownership interests outside of Alset International, including a 36.9% equity interest in American Pacific Bancorp Inc., an indirect 15.5% equity interest in Holista CollTech Limited, a 45.2% equity interest in DSS Inc. (“DSS”), an 38.3% equity interest in Value Exchange International, Inc., a 0.8% equity interest in New Electric CV Corporation (formerly known as “American Premium Mining Corporation”), and an interest in Alset Capital Acquisition Corp. (“Alset Capital”). American Pacific Bancorp Inc. is a financial network holding company. Holista CollTech Limited is a public Australian company that produces natural food ingredients (ASX: HCT). DSS is a multinational company operating businesses within nine divisions: product packaging, biotechnology, direct marketing, commercial lending, securities and investment management, alternative trading, digital transformation, secure living, and alternative energy. DSS Inc. is listed on the NYSE American (NYSE: DSS). Value Exchange International, Inc. is a provider of information technology services for businesses, and is traded on the OTCQB (OTCQB: VEII). New Electric CV Corporation is a publicly traded consumer products company (OTCPK: HIPH). Alset Capital is a newly organized blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses and is listed on the Nasdaq (Nasdaq: ACAXU, ACAX, ACAXW and ACAXR).


Under the guidance of Chan Heng Fai, our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who is also our largest stockholder, we have positioned ourselves as a participant in these key markets through a series of strategic transactions. Our growth strategy is both to pursue acquisition opportunities that we can leverage on our global network using our capital and management resources and to accelerate the expansion of our organic businesses.
 
We generally acquire majority and/or control stakes in innovative and promising businesses that are expected to appreciate in value over time. Our emphasis is on building businesses in industries where our management team has in-depth knowledge and experience, or where our management can provide value by advising on new markets and expansion. We have at times provided a range of global capital and management services to these companies in order to gain access to Asian markets. We have historically favored businesses that improve an individual’s quality of life or that improve the efficiency of businesses through technology in various industries. We believe our capital and management services provide us with a competitive advantage in the selection of strategic acquisitions, which creates and adds value for our company and our stockholders.
 
We intend at all times to operate our business in a manner as to not become inadvertently subject to the regulatory requirements under the Investment Company Act by, among other things, (i) in the event of acquisitions, purchasing all or substantially all of an acquisition target’s voting stock, and only in limited cases purchase less than 51% of the voting stock; (ii) monitoring our operations and our assets on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that we own no less than a majority, or other control, of Alset International and that Alset International, in turn, owns no less than a majority, or other control, of LiquidValue Development Inc. and other such subsidiaries with significant assets and operations; and (iii) limiting additional equity investments into affiliated companies including our majority-owned and/or controlled operating subsidiaries, except in special limited circumstances. Additionally, we will continue to hire in-house management personnel and employees with industry background and experience, rather than retaining traditional investment portfolio managers to oversee our group of companies.

Our Current Operations
 
Real Estate
 
Property Development Business
 
Our real estate business is primarily conducted through our indirect subsidiary, LiquidValue Development Inc. (“LiquidValue Development”), a 99.9%-owned U.S. subsidiary of Alset International, which owns, operates and manages real estate development projects with a focus on land subdivision developments (LiquidValue Development was formerly known as “SeD Intelligent Home Inc.”). We generally contract out all real estate development activities, working with engineers, surveyors, architects and general contractors through each phase, including planning, design and construction. Once the contractors complete the land development, we then sell the developed lots to builders for the construction of new homes. Where possible, we have attempted to pre-sell these lots before they are fully developed. LiquidValue Development’s main assets are two such subdivision development projects, one near Houston, Texas (known as Black Oak), and one in Frederick, Maryland (known as Ballenger Run).
 
Our property development business is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our property development business accounted for 29% and 70% of our total revenues, respectively.
 
Frederick, Maryland Property. In November 2015, through LiquidValue Development, we acquired Ballenger Run, a land subdivision development consisting of 197 acres, for $15.65 million. This property is presently zoned for 479 entitled residential lots and 210 entitled multi-family units. After several years of development, this project is now in its final phases. The Company anticipates that the estimated construction costs (not including land costs and financing costs) for the final phases of the Ballenger Run project will be $249,133. The expected completion date for the final phases of the Ballenger Run project is June of 2023.
 
On May 28, 2014, the RBG Family, LLC entered into an Assignable Real Estate Sales Contract with NVR, Inc. (“NVR”) by which RBG Family, LLC would sell the 197 acres for $15 million to NVR. On December 10, 2014, NVR assigned this contract to SeD Maryland Development, LLC (“SeD Maryland”) in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and entered into a series of Lot Purchase Agreements by which NVR purchased subdivided lots from SeD Maryland (the “Lot Purchase Agreements”).
 
SeD Maryland’s acquisition of the 197 acres was funded in part from a $5.6 million deposit from NVR. The balance of $10.05 million was derived from a total equity contribution of $15.2 million by SeD Ballenger, LLC (“SeD Ballenger”) and CNQC Maryland Development LLC (a unit of Qingjian International Group Co, Ltd, China, “CNQC”). The project is owned by SeD Maryland is 83.55% owned by SeD Ballenger and 16.45% by CNQC.
 
MacKenzie Equity Partners, owned by Charles MacKenzie, our Chief Development Officer and a Director of the Company’s subsidiary LiquidValue Development, has had a consulting agreement with a subsidiary of the Company since 2015. Per the terms of the agreement, as amended on January 1, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary pays a monthly fee of $20,000 for the consulting services. Pursuant to an agreement entered into in June of 2022, the Company’s subsidiary has paid $25,000 per month for consulting services, effective as of January 2022. The Company incurred expenses of $350,000 and $360,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were capitalized as part of Real Estate on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as the services relate to property and project management. During 2022 and 2021, MacKenzie Equity Partners was granted additional $50,000 and $120,000 bonus payments, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company owed $25,000 and $80,000, respectively, to this entity.
 
Revenue from Ballenger Run is anticipated to come from three main sources:
 

● | sale of 479 entitled and constructed residential lots to NVR; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
● | sale of the lot for the 210 entitled multi-family units; and 
● | sale of 479 front foot benefit assessments.

On April 17, 2019, SeD Maryland Development LLC entered into a Development Loan Agreement with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) which is comprised of: (1) a Note in the principal amount not to exceed at any one time outstanding the sum of $8,000,000, with a cumulative loan advance amount of $18,500,000, and (2) a letter of credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to $900,000 (the “L/C Facility”). The Note bears an interest rate of the one month LIBOR plus 375 basis points. Commissions on each letter of credit (“L/C”) are 1.5% per annum on the face amount of the L/C. Other standard lender fees apply in the event L/C is drawn down. The Note is a revolving line of credit. The L/C Facility is not a revolving loan, and amounts advanced and repaid may not be re-borrowed. Repayment of the Development Loan Agreement was secured by $2,600,000 collateral fund and a Deed of Trust issued to M&T Bank on the property owned by SeD Maryland.
 
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the principal balance of the loan was $0. As part of the transaction during 2019, we incurred loan origination fees and closing fees in the amount of $381,823 and capitalized them into construction in process. On March 15, 2022, approximately $2,300,000 was released from collateral, leaving approximately $300,000 as collateral for outstanding letters of credit.
 
The proceeds from the Land Development Loan and Letter of Credit Facility were used in connection with the Ballenger Run project, including the development of certain single-family lots. The Loan Agreement contains standard representations and warranties. LiquidValue Development Inc. will serve as the guarantor to the Land Development Loan and Letter of Credit Facility and has executed an Environmental Indemnification Agreement in favor of the Lender.
 
Sale of Residential Lots to NVR
 
The residential lots were contracted for sale under the Lot Purchase Agreements with NVR. NVR is a home builder engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhouses and condominium buildings. It also operates a mortgage banking and title services business. Under the Lot Purchase Agreements, NVR provided SeD Maryland Development LLC with an upfront deposit of $5.6 million and has agreed to purchase the lots at a range of prices. The lot types and quantities to be sold to NVR under the Lot Purchase Agreements include the following:
 

Lot Type | Quantity | 
-----------------------------------------+----------+----
Single Family Detached Large | | 85 
Single Family Detached Small | | 89 
Single Family Detached Neo Traditional | | 33 
Single Family Attached 28’ Villa | | 121
Single Family Attached 20’ End Unit | | 46 
Single Family Attached 16’ Internal Unit | | 105
Total | | 479

 
There were five different types of Lot Purchase Agreements, which had generally the same terms except for the price and unit details for each type of lot. Under the Lot Purchase Agreements, NVR has agreed to purchase 30 available lots per quarter. The Lot Purchase Agreements provided several conditions related to preparation of the lots which had be met so that a lot can be made available for sale to NVR. SeD Maryland was to provide customary lot preparation including survey, grading, utilities installation, paving, and other infrastructure and engineering. The sale of lots to NVR began in May 2017. As of December 31, 2022, all 479 lots have been sold to NVR.
 
Sale of the Front Foot Benefit Assessments
 
Through LiquidValue Development and its subsidiaries, we have established a front foot benefit (“FFB”) assessment on all of the lots sold to NVR. This is a 30-year annual assessment allowed in Frederick County which requires homeowners to reimburse the developer for the costs of installing public water and sewer to the lots. These assessments become effective as homes are settled, at which time we can sell the collection rights to investors who will pay an upfront lump sum, enabling us to more quickly realize the revenue. The selling prices range from $3,000 to $4,500 per home depending on the type of home. Our total expected revenue from the front foot benefit assessment is approximately $1 million. To recognize revenue of the FFB assessment, both our and NVR’s performance obligations have to be satisfied. Our performance obligation is completed once we complete the construction of water and sewer facilities and close the lot sales with NVR, which inspects these water and sewer facilities prior to the close of lot sales to ensure all specifications are met. NVR’s performance obligation is to sell homes they build to homeowners. Our FFB revenue is recognized upon NVR’s sales of homes to homeowners. The agreement with these FFB investors is not subject to amendment by regulatory agencies and thus our revenue from FFB assessment is not either. During the years ended December, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenue in the amounts of $126,737 and $289,375 from FFB assessments, respectively.

Certain arrangements for the sale of buildable lots to NVR require the Company to credit NVR with an amount equal to one year of the FFB assessment. Under ASC 606, the credits to NVR are not in exchange for a distinct good or service and accordingly, the amount of the credit was recognized as the reduction of revenue. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the accrued balance due to NVR was $189,475 and $188,125, respectively.
 
K-6 Grade School Site
 
In connection with getting the necessary approvals for the Ballenger Project, we agreed to transfer 30 acres of land that abut the development for the construction of a local K-6 grade school. We will not be involved in the construction of the school.
 
Black Oak Property, Texas. Black Oak is a land infrastructure and subdivision development project situated in Magnolia, Texas, north of Houston. The site plan at Black Oak allows for approximately 550-600 residential lots of varying sizes. Through a partnership with 150 CCM Black Oak, Ltd., we had contracts to purchase seven contiguous parcels of land. Our initial equity ownership in 150 CCM Black Oak, Ltd. was $4.3 million for 60% ownership in the partnership. Since then, LiquidValue Development has increased its ownership to 100%. On January 18, 2019, the first sale of lots at Black Oak was completed and 124 lots were sold.
 
The Black Oak project has applied for reimbursement of certain costs for construction of roads, sewers, water and other basic requirements. While we may be entitled to reimbursements from a local improvement district, the amount and timing of such payments is uncertain. The timing of such potential reimbursements will be impacted by certain bond sales by the Southeast Management District from time to time.
 
On November 4, 2021, Black Oak Ltd received $750,000 reimbursement from Aqua Texas pursuant to a contractual agreement whereby Aqua is obligated to pay 150 CCM Black Oak $6,000 for each connection made to an individual single-family home upon sale to the end customer.
 
On January 13, 2021, 150 CCM Black Oak, Ltd. purchased an approximately 6.3 acre tract of land in Montgomery County, Texas. The Company’s strategic acquisition contiguous to the Black Oak project is intended to provide additional lot yield, potential additional amenities and/or a solar farm to support the Company’s sustainable, healthy living concept.
 
On October 28, 2022, 150 CCM Black Oak Ltd. (the “Seller”), entered into a Contract for Purchase and Sale and Escrow Instructions (the “Agreement”) with Century Land Holdings of Texas, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the “Buyer”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Seller agreed to sell approximately 242 single-family detached residential lots in a residential community in the city of Magnolia, Texas, known as the “Lakes at Black Oak.” The parties agreed that the lots will be sold at a range of prices, and the Seller will also be entitled to receive a community enhancement fee for each lot sold. The Buyer was entitled to a thirty (30) day inspection period in which to inspect the properties and determine their suitability; during such inspection period, the Buyer was entitled to decline to proceed with the closing of these transactions.
 
The aggregate purchase price and community enhancement fees were originally anticipated to be $12,881,000, with such purchase price to be adjusted accordingly, if the total number of lots increased or decreased prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
 
On November 28, 2022, the parties to the Agreement entered into an amendment to the Agreement (the “Amendment”). Pursuant to the Amendment, the Buyer will now proceed with the purchase of approximately 131 single-family detached residential lots, instead of 242 lots, and the anticipated purchase price has been reduced.
 
The closing of the transactions described in the Agreement depends on the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth therein. There can be no assurance that such closings will be completed on the terms outlined herein or at all.

The Seller shall be required to develop and improve the property at the Seller’s cost pursuant to certain development plans and government regulations prior to the closings described above.
 
The site plan at Black Oak allows for approximately 550-600 residential lots of varying sizes. We anticipate that our involvement in land development aspects of this project will take approximately three to five additional years to complete, however, at the present time, the Company is also considering expanding its current policy of selling buildable lots to include a strategy of building housing for sale or rent, particularly at our Black Oak and Alset Villas (described below) properties. The required time and expenses needed to complete the Black Oak and Alset Villas projects will be influenced by the strategy, or mix of strategies, we utilize at each project.
 
Recent Agreements to Sell Additional Lots
 
Agreement to Sell 110 Lots
 
On March 16, 2023, the Seller entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase and Sale Agreement”) with Rausch Coleman Homes Houston, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Rausch Coleman”). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Seller has agreed to sell approximately 110 single-family detached residential lots which comprise a section of the Lakes at Black Oak. The price of the lots and certain community enhancement fees the Seller will be entitled to receive are anticipated to equal an aggregate of $6,586,250.
 
The closing of the sale of these 110 lots depends on the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Purchase and Sale Agreement. There can be no assurance that such closings will be completed on the terms outlined herein or at all. Commencing on March 16, 2023, Rausch Coleman has a thirty (30) day inspection period in which to inspect the properties and determine their suitability; during such inspection period, Rausch Coleman may decline to proceed with the closing of these transactions.

The Seller shall be required to complete certain improvements at the property at the Seller’s cost prior to the closing.
 
Planned Alset Villas Project in Texas. In 2021, our subsidiary Alset EHome Inc. acquired approximately 19.5 acres of partially developed land near Houston, Texas which will be used to develop a community named Alset Villas (“Alset Villas”). Alset EHome is targeting to develop approximately 63 homes at Alset Villas for rent and/or for sale. The Alset Villas project remains at the early stage.

Home Rental Business
 
Houston, Texas Rental Homes. Recently, the Company expanded its real estate portfolio to single family rental houses. During 2022 and 2021 the Company signed multiple purchase agreements to acquire 23 and 109 homes, respectively, in Montgomery and Harris Counties, Texas. By December 31, 2022, the acquisition of all 132 homes was completed with an aggregate purchase cost of $30,998,258. All of these purchased homes are properties of our rental business.
 
On December 9, 2022, Alset Inc. entered into an agreement with Alset EHome Inc. and Alset International Limited pursuant to which Alset Inc. agreed to reorganize the ownership of its home rental business. Previously, Alset Inc. and certain majority-owned subsidiaries collectively owned 132 single-family rental homes in Texas. 112 of these rental homes are owned by subsidiaries of American Home REIT Inc. (“AHR”). Alset Inc. owns 85.4% of Alset International Limited, and Alset International Limited indirectly owns approximately 99.9% of Alset EHome Inc.
 
The closing of the transaction contemplated by this agreement was completed on January 13, 2023. Pursuant to this agreement, Alset Inc. has become the direct owner of AHR and its subsidiaries that collectively own these 112 homes, instead of such homes being owned indirectly through Alset International Limited’s subsidiaries.
 
Alset EHome Inc. sold AHR to Alset Inc. for a total consideration of $26,250,933, including the forgiveness of debt in the amount of $13,900,000, a promissory note in the amount of $11,350,933 and a cash payment of $1,000,000. This purchase price represents the book value of AHR as of November 30, 2022.
 
The closing of this transaction was approved by the shareholders of Alset International Limited. Certain members of Alset Inc.’s Board of Directors and management are also members of the Board of Directors and management of each of Alset International Limited and Alset EHome Inc.
 
In approximately fifty-three single-family of the 132 rental homes that were acquired by our subsidiary in 2022 and 2021, as part of our commitment to advancing smart and healthy, sustainable living, we have installed Tesla PV solar panels and Powerwalls. We are reviewing plans to add solar panels and related technologies at the balance of the single-family rental homes, where feasible. In addition, we have added technologies at many of the single-family rental homes such as (i) smart solar, thermostat, and energy usage controls; (ii) smart lighting controls; (iii) smart locks and security; and (iv) smart home automation devices. We believe these and other technologies will be attractive to renters and we continue to build and pursue strategic, technological partnerships that will assist us as we expand our real estate business to include building homes for rent and building homes for sale in the future.
 
The Company has entered into a property management agreement with the property managers under which the property managers generally oversee and direct the leasing, management and advertising of the properties in our portfolio, including collecting rents and acting as liaison with the tenants. The Company pays its property managers a monthly property management fee per property unit and a leasing fee.
 
Potential Future Projects
 
In addition to our main projects, we are embarking on residential construction activities in partnership with U.S. homebuilders, and have commenced discussions to acquire smaller U.S. residential construction projects. These projects may be within both the for-sale and for-rent markets. We consider projects in diverse regions across the United States, and maintain longstanding relationships with local owners, brokers, attorneys and lenders to source projects. We will continue to focus on off-market deals and raise appropriate financing for attractive development opportunities. We believe these initiatives will provide a set of solutions to stabilize the long-term revenue associated with property development in the United States and create new ancillary service opportunities and revenue from this business.
 
Through our subsidiaries, we will explore the potential to pursue other business opportunities related to real estate. The Company is evaluating the potential to enter into additional activities related to solar energy and energy efficient products as well as smart home technologies. Through the Company’s eco-systems of businesses based around sustainable, healthy living communities, our Alset EHome Inc. subsidiary intends to develop single family homes which are eco-friendly. They will be fitted out with solar energy products such as photovoltaic systems, battery systems, and car charging ports for sustainable transport as well as other energy efficient systems. The Company also envisions acquiring land surrounding its communities for solar farm projects to power these communities. Alset EHome has commenced the infrastructure design, engineering and construction for this sustainable, healthy living community concept within the Black Oak project outside of Houston, Texas. The Company intends to bring this concept to other strategic parts of the US.

We also intend to enlarge the scope of property-related services. Additional planned activities, which we intend to be carried out through Alset EHome, include financing, home management, realtor services, insurance and home title validation. We may particularly provide these services in connection with homes we build. These activities are also in the planning stages.
 
Digital Transformation Technology
 
Our digital transformation technology business unit is committed to enabling enterprises to engage in a digital transformation by providing support, implementation and development services with various technologies including blockchain, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligent and metaverse. We commenced our technology business in 2015 through Hapi Metaverse Inc. (“Hapi Metaverse”) (formerly known as GigWorld Inc.), our 99.7% owned subsidiary. Its technology platform focuses on business-to-business, or B2B, solutions, such as communications and workflow, through instant messaging, international calling, social media, e-commerce. Hapi Metaverse’s latest investment into Value Exchange International Inc. (“VEII”) expanded our offering to retail business digital transformation such as supermarket and chain stores. Hapi Metaverse is now the largest stockholder of VEII.
 
Through Hapi Metaverse, we have successfully implemented several strategic platform developments for clients, including a mobile front-end solution for network marketing, a hotel e-commerce platform for a company in Asia and a real estate agent management platform in China.

While focusing on direct selling industry by building white label mobile applications for direct marketing and affiliate marketing brands, VEII has been working on I.T. Services for major retailers in Asia and enhanced their offering with mobile applications and artificial intelligence.
 
We believe that the increasing deployment of the GigWorld App  (whether through white labeling by potential customers or otherwise) will allow for feedback from customers, and help us build a robust and scalable software. Adding latest technological framework such as A.I. and Metaverse allows the company to enhance our clients’ digital transformation journey with better consumer engagement and analytics.
 
Biohealth Business
 
With populations aging and a growing focus on healthcare issues, biohealth science has become increasingly vital. We entered the biomedical and healthcare market by forming our biohealth division, which is engaged in developing, researching, testing, manufacturing, licensing and distributing (through retail, direct selling, network marketing and e-commerce) biohealth products and services. We strive to leverage our scientific know-how and intellectual property rights to provide solutions to pending healthcare issues.
 
HWH World. In October 2019, the Company expanded its biohealth segment into the Korean market through one of the subsidiaries of HWH International Inc., HWH World Inc (“HWH World”). HWH World is in the business of sourcing and distributing dietary supplements and other health products through its network of members in the Republic of Korea (“South Korea”). HWH World generates product sales via its direct sale model as products are sold to its members. Through the use of a Hapi Gig platform that combines e-commerce, social media and a customized rewards system, HWH Korea equips, trains and empowers its members. We compete with numerous direct sales companies in South Korea.

Vivacitas Oncology. Until March 18, 2021, we held an equity interest in Vivacitas Oncology Inc., a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company. The Company sold the subsidiary that held this interest to a subsidiary of DSS for $2,480,000. We had an indirect equity interest of 13.1% of Vivacitas at December 31, 2020. Vivacitas focuses on developing medications for cancer patients. We had a close partnership with Vivacitas and its management, an experienced research team and a distinguished medical advisory board. Vivacitas seeks to bring more effective and less toxic chemotherapies to the market for treatment of the most aggressive and intractable cancers. At the time of this sale, Vivacitas had three programs: (i) one program had completed three clinical studies, including two Phase I and one Phase II studies; (ii) one program for a potential palliative treatment had completed three Phase III studies; and (iii) one program was in the planning stages of a 2b/3 clinical study.
 
Our financial statements did not consolidate Vivacitas Oncology, and we had not managed its operations.
 
Other Business Activities
 
In addition to our three principal business activities, we oversee several smaller other business activities at the present time, which we believe complement our three principal businesses.
 
BMI Capital Partners. Alset International’s wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary, BMI Capital Partners International Limited provides consultancy services on corporate restructuring efforts, debt restructuring efforts and capital markets related corporate actions, including potential stock exchange listings.
 
Alset F&B. The Company, through Alset F&B One Pte. Ltd. (“Alset F&B One”) and Alset F&B (PLQ) Pte. Ltd. (“Alset F&B PLQ”) each acquired a restaurant franchise licenses at the end of 2021 and 2022 respectively, both of which have since commenced operations. These licenses will allow Alset F&B One and Alset F&B PLQ each to operate a Killiney Kopitiam restaurant in Singapore. Killiney Kopitiam, founded in 1919, is a Singapore-based chain of mass-market, traditional kopitiam style service cafes selling traditional coffee and tea, along with a range of local delicacies such as Curry Chicken, Laksa, Mee Siam, and Mee Rebus.
 
Hapi Cafes. The Company, through Hapi Café Inc. (“HCI-T”), commenced operation of two cafés during 2022 and 2021, which are located in Singapore and South Korea.
 
The cafes are operated by subsidiaries of HCI-T, namely Hapi Café SG Pte. Limited (“HCSG”) in Singapore and Hapi Café Korea Inc. (“HCKI”) in Seoul, South Korea.

Alset Capital is a newly organized blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 
 
The Company owns 55% and its majority-owned subsidiary Alset International Limited owns 45% of the sole member of Alset Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, the sponsor (the “Sponsor”) of Alset Capital.
 
On February 3, 2022, the Sponsor purchased 473,750 units (the “Private Placement Units”) pursuant to a private placement for a purchase price of $4,737,500. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, one-half of one warrant and one right entitling the holder to receive one tenth (1/10) of one share of Class A common stock. Previously, the Sponsor had purchased 2,156,250 shares of Class B common stock pursuant to a private placement for a purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.012 per share. The Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of Alset Capital’s initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain adjustments.
 
While Alset Capital may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry, it initially intended to focus on identifying businesses in the real estate industry, including construction, homebuilding, real estate owners and operators, arrangers of financing, insurance, and other services for real estate, and adjacent businesses and technologies targeting the real estate space, which may be referred to as “Proptech” businesses. Immediately following its initial public offering, Alset Capital began to evaluate acquisition candidates that can be considered Proptech businesses. However, Alset Capital did not identify a suitable acquisition candidate in the Proptech business. Instead, on September 9, 2022, Alset Capital entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Alset Capital, our indirect subsidiary HWH International Inc., a Nevada corporation (“HWH”) and HWH Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alset Capital (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, a business combination between Alset Capital and HWH will be effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into HWH, with HWH surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alset Capital (the “Merger”). Upon the closing of the Merger, it is anticipated that Alset Capital will change its name to “HWH International Inc.”
 
 We expect Alset Capital to operate as a separately managed, publicly traded entity following the completion of the initial business combination, or “De-SPAC”.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We focus our corporate marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, communicating the advantages of our various platforms and generating qualified leads for our sales team. Our corporate marketing plan is designed to continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for our offerings. We rely on a number of channels in this area, including digital advertising, email marketing, social media, affiliate marketing and broad-based media, as well as through various strategic partnerships. We maintain our website at https://www.alsetinc.com, and our various operating subsidiaries maintain individual websites, many of which are accessible through our main website.
 
Each of our businesses has developed a field sales force in their geographic markets. These sales force teams are responsible for identifying and managing individual sales opportunities in their respective regions.
 
Competition
 
The businesses in which we participate, real estate, digital transformation technology and biohealth, are each highly competitive. Competition is based upon several factors, including price, reputation, quality and brand recognition. Existing and future competitors may introduce products and services in the same markets we serve, and competing products or services may have better performance, lower prices, better functionality and broader acceptance than our products. Our competitors may also add features to their products or services similar to features that presently differentiate our product and service offerings from theirs. This competition could result in increased sales and marketing expenses, thereby materially reducing our operating margins, and could harm our ability to increase, or cause us to lose, market share. Some of our competitors and potential competitors supply a wide variety of products and services, and have well-established relationships with our current and prospective customers.
 
Most, if not all, of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic regions or user demographics than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. By way of example, in our real estate business, some of our competitors already have the advantage of having created vertically integrated businesses, while other competitors have broader and deeper relationships with sources of financing. Other competitors in our real estate business may have more substantial ties and experience in geographical areas in which we operate.

Our competitors may develop products, features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. This is particularly relevant for our digital transformation technology business. Certain competitors could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in our target market or markets. As a result, our competitors may acquire and engage customers or generate revenue at the expense of our own efforts.
 
Protection of Proprietary Technology
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary information, technology and brands.
 
We protect our proprietary information and technology, in part, by generally requiring our employees to enter into agreements providing for the maintenance of confidentiality and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. We also may enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with certain of our technical consultants to protect our confidential and proprietary information and technology. We cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants will not be breached, that we will be able to effectively enforce these agreements, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach of these agreements, or that our trade secrets and other proprietary information and technology will not be disclosed or will otherwise be protected.
 
We also rely on contractual and license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our technology and services. There is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights. Protection of confidential information, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights in the markets in which we operate and compete is highly uncertain and may involve complex legal questions. We cannot completely prevent the unauthorized use or infringement of our confidential information or intellectual property rights as such prevention is inherently difficult. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our confidential information and intellectual property protection.
 
Government Regulation
 
Like many similarly diversified companies, our operations are subject to routine regulation by governmental agencies. Much of this regulation will affect us indirectly, inasmuch as, and to the extent that, it affects our customers more directly. A summary of the laws and regulations that might affect our customers is set forth below.
 
Real Estate Business. The development of our real estate projects will require us to comply with federal, state and local environmental regulations. In connection with this compliance, our real estate acquisition and development projects will require environmental studies. To date, we have spent approximately $57,581 on environmental studies and compliance. Such costs are reflected in capitalized construction costs in our financial statements.
 
The cost of complying with governmental regulations is significant and will increase if we add additional real estate projects, become involved in homebuilding in the future and are required to comply with certain due diligence procedures related to third party lenders.
 
At the present time, we believe that we have all of the material government approvals that we need to conduct our business as currently conducted. We are subject to periodic local permitting that must be addressed, but we do not anticipate that such requirements for government approval will have a material impact on our business as presently conducted. We are required to comply with government regulations and to make filings from time to time with various government entities. Such work is typically handled by outside contractors we retain.
 
Digital Transformation Technology Business. Companies conducting business on the Internet are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations. In addition, laws and regulations relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. Online businesses face risks from some of the proposed legislation that could be passed in the future.

The adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, including laws impacting Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business. As we expand internationally, government regulation concerning the Internet, and in particular, network neutrality, may be nascent or non-existent. Within such a regulatory environment, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.
 
In the United States, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, which include actions for libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content generated by users. Certain foreign jurisdictions are also testing the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties. Any court ruling that imposes liability on providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties could harm our licensees’ businesses, and thus, indirectly, our business.
 
Biohealth Business. Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which our operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States, the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe are examples of such increased regulation.
 
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally. The regulatory agencies under whose purview we operate have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, our subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.
 
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
 
Further, we rely on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. These processes also are subject to lengthy regulatory approvals.
 
As described above, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, disclosure and the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation. Our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires us to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability.

Rigorous legal and compliance analysis of our businesses is endemic to our culture and risk management. Management of each of our businesses supervise our compliance personnel, who are responsible for addressing all regulatory and compliance matters that affect our activities. We strive to maintain a culture of compliance through the use of policies and procedures, including a code of ethics, electronic compliance systems, testing and monitoring, communication of compliance guidance and employee education and training. Our compliance policies and procedures address a variety of regulatory and compliance matters such as the handling of material non-public information, personal securities trading, marketing practices, gifts and entertainment, valuation of investments, recordkeeping, potential conflicts of interest, the allocation of corporate opportunities, collection of fees and expense allocation.
 
We also monitor the information barriers that we maintain between the public and private sides of our businesses. We believe that our various businesses’ access to the intellectual knowledge and contacts and relationships that reside throughout our firm benefits all of our businesses. To maximize that access without compromising compliance with our legal and contractual obligations, our compliance group oversees and monitors the communications between groups that are on the private side of our information barrier and groups that are on the public side, as well as between different public side groups. Our compliance group also monitors contractual obligations that may be impacted and potential conflicts that may arise in connection with these inter-group discussions.
 
Facilities
 
We manage our worldwide business from our principal executive offices located in Bethesda, Maryland, in a leased space of approximately 2,059 square feet, under a lease that expires in 2024. We also maintain offices in Singapore, Magnolia, Texas, Hong Kong and South Korea through leased spaces aggregating approximately 15,811 square feet, under leases expiring on various dates from May 2023 to August 2025. The leases have rental rates ranging from $2,300 to $23,020 per month. Our total rent expense under these office leases was $767,306 and $587,685 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect total rent expense to be approximately $944,807 under office leases in 2023. We believe our present office space and locations are adequate for our current operations and for near-term planned expansion.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2023, we had a total of 48 full-time employees. In addition to our full-time employees, we occasionally hire part-time employees and independent contractors to assist us in various operations, including real estate, research and product development and production.
 
Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and sales personnel for whom competition is intense. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with employees and contractors are good.
