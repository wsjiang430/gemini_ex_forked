ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
AvePoint provides a cloud-native software platform that organizations rely on to optimize IT operations, manage critical data and secure the digital workplace. As companies globally embrace the new normal of hybrid work, they must build and deliver a new, seamless workplace experience for knowledge workers, centered around an extensive portfolio of Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions and productivity applications aimed at improving collaboration across the organization.
 
The adoption of this portfolio of solutions – what has been generally described as the “digital transformation” – is a substantial and ongoing challenge for most organizations, which for decades had used only a small number of multi-purpose on-premises applications to drive business outcomes. However, to build and deliver an efficient digital workplace today, companies must manage this range of applications – and the associated explosive growth and sprawl of data – with a platform offering that is well governed, fit for purpose, easy to use and built on automation.
 
AvePoint’s Confidence Platform empowers organizations – of all sizes, in all regions, and across all industries – to optimize and secure the solutions that most commonly establish and underpin the digital workplace. As our customers seek to rapidly reduce costs, improve productivity and make more informed business decisions, they depend on our platform for data-driven insights, critical business intelligence and ongoing operational value through automation.
 
Platform Overview
 
The AvePoint Confidence Platform delivers a comprehensive set of SaaS solutions, empowering users in a variety of technology roles – including IT operations, development operations and cybersecurity – to monitor and secure the digital workplace.
 
Built on top of Platform-as-a-Service (“PaaS”) architecture, the AvePoint Confidence Platform offers modularity and combines cloud services architecture with tailored, industry-specific functionality to address critical operational challenges and the ongoing management of data, as organizations leverage a variety of third-party cloud vendors, including Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, AWS, Box, DropBox and others. To drive modernization efforts, the platform also provides extensions to the functionality of existing cloud services as well as new applications, all while leveraging the common underlying SaaS services for data, process, user experience and integration.
 
The AvePoint Confidence Platform, and the applications that it powers, is organized into three interconnected “suites” of functionality—each targeting a core set of business drivers and customer needs. Those suites are:
 

■ | The Control Suite efficiently ensures the sustainability and operational capacity of the digital workplace by providing a ready-made framework for automated governance and policy enforcement. This allows infrastructure and operations teams to protect business-critical information across collaborative workspaces. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | The Resilience Suite enables organizations to efficiently and effectively comply with data protection regulations, preserve critical records, and ensure business continuity. This provides regulatory, audit, and risk management teams with the assurance that the organization is meeting its compliance obligations. 
■ | The Modernization Suite transforms legacy data to allow it use by modern SaaS platforms and transforms legacy business processes into modern end-user business applications. It empowers modernization and change management teams to drive digital transformation across the organization, and to measure and accelerate the impact of this transformation on employee experience and engagement.

 
Built with security and scale in mind, AvePoint’s cloud-native platform is available across 14 global data centers. Our multi-tenant architecture is designed to immediately provide customers the latest enhancements and upgrades, and the platform is ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 27017:2015 certified and has received SOC 2 Type II accreditation and FedRAMP (Moderate) Authorization.

 Item 1
 
Within each suite are a number of products addressing critical customer needs. Our products are typically licensed according to the number of users, while some include a consumption-based component. Lastly, because our platform is built upon a common data engine and common data layer, the purchase of products from multiple suites provides an incremental benefit to customers in the form of more intelligent and relevant data insights and automation.
 

■ | The Control Suite contains products which offer the following capabilities:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Operationalize collaborative workspaces: centralize the management of SaaS solutions and productivity applications, with the flexibility to configure and delegate control for different end-users;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Regulatory compliance automation: Implement, enforce, and prove that access and configuration policies across collaborative workspaces comply with internal or regulatory requirements; 
o | Access and risk management: gain insight into who has access to critical data and where the company is at risk; and 
o | Cost optimization: maximize the return on SaaS subscription investments through real-time management and allocation of entitlements; 


■ | The Resilience Suite contains products which offer the following capabilities:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Backup-as-a-Service: support workloads in cloud infrastructure-as-a-Service and PaaS, including protection against ransomware, accidental deletions and user error in a variety of SaaS applications, as well as support for a range of on-premises workloads;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Data classification: automate data tagging, classification and protection to prevent loss; 
o | Storage optimization: archive stale content from active systems to reduce costs and improve workspace quality and user experience; and 
o | Records management: ensure content compliance and proper records retention with process automation. 


■ | The Modernization Suite contains products which offer the following capabilities:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Data modernization and restructuring: seamlessly move and transform legacy data to allow its use by modern SaaS platforms, and ensure that unstructured data can be easily restructured to reflect ongoing changes in the business;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | Process modernization: transform manual processes with built-in data insights and process automation for Line of Business and role-based applications; and 
o | Workforce transformation measurement: enable employees to thrive in the digital workplace by ensuring organizational leaders understand employee engagement and sentiment. 

Our Growth Strategy 
 
Our aggressive pursuit of the large market opportunity we see includes the following growth strategies:
 

■ | Expand our Platform Opportunity. We have built a differentiated platform that enables organizations to integrate modern applications, and our goal is to continually invest in technologies that improve the digital workplace experience. We will introduce new and adjacent products to extend our current operational and data management story and to improve the functionality of existing products and features. We also have invested and will continue to invest in opportunities beyond the Microsoft ecosystem. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Grow our Customer Base. The market we are targeting is rapidly growing and largely unpenetrated. We sell to organizations of all sizes, in all regions of the world, and across a broad array of industries. While historically we primarily focused on larger, more highly regulated enterprises, the offering of our platform as a SaaS solution makes it more accessible to and in demand from small and medium-sized organizations. We intend to drive new customer growth by leveraging our global partner ecosystem and through the expansion of our direct sales force. 
■ | Increase Customer Lifetime Value with Customer Success. We constantly seek to increase customer satisfaction, decrease time to value, reduce customer churn and set up successful land and expand opportunities. To do so, we have made significant investments in our customer success program and in technology which provides additional telemetry to enhance our understanding of how our customers use our solutions, which we believe will deepen our relationships with existing customers. 
■ | Grow and Cultivate our Partner and Channel Network. We believe that building and cultivating strategic relationships with partners will enable us to penetrate those markets in which we previously lacked presence and those in which we have a presence that can be expanded. Our partner and channel network today touches all aspects of our business, but we believe there is a particular opportunity with our small and mid-sized customers and prospects. 
■ | Opportunistically Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Acquisitions are an important growth driver for our business. We completed four acquisitions in 2022, and we expect to continue acquiring businesses and technologies or entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. This may include acquiring complementary products, technologies, and/or businesses that reduce the time or costs required to develop new technologies, incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings, augment our engineering workforce, improve our internal business and operating systems, and enhance our technological capabilities.

Sales, Marketing and Customers 
 
Sales
 
Our global go-to-market strategy allows us to efficiently sell to and serve the needs of organizations across market segments and geographies. This strategy, which combines the expertise of our highly-trained direct sales force with the leverage of valuable indirect routes to the market, including our strong partner ecosystem, has created a powerful and differentiated go-to-market approach. In addition, our increased investments in our customer success program positions us to continue expanding within our existing customer base, which we believe remains a significant growth opportunity.
 
Our direct sales force is organized by geography and customer size.
 
In addition, we employ a number of indirect routes to market, which include the following:
 

■ | Channel Ecosystem. We leverage the resources of our partner and channel community across customers of all segments. We expect that partner sourced revenue will account for a growing portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Partner Marketplaces. AvePoint is transactable in more than 100 marketplaces around the world through our distribution and marketplace partners. We leverage marketplaces to create operational efficiencies with automation in procurement and provisioning, and to grow and scale our acquisition of the small business market, primarily through managed service providers (“MSPs”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Microsoft Partnership. We are a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, ranking in the global top 5 in Microsoft’s IP-Co-Sell program. Microsoft sellers are incentivized to develop a pipeline, share sales leads, and accelerate sales of AvePoint solutions, and we plan to continue adding to the number of co-sell ready solutions currently available. 

 
These collective efforts are supported by our customer success team, which employs a proactive relationship-focused approach designed to ensure that our valued customers get the care they need to rapidly deploy, and receive value from, their technology investment in us.
 
Marketing
 
Our global marketing organization focuses on enhancing the AvePoint brand and building awareness and demand generation through multi-platform campaigns that leverage our expertise, content, technical resources and customer stories. We rely on multiple marketing and sales automation tools to efficiently identify and market to the correct individuals at target companies using product and industry specific criteria.
Customers
 
We sell to organizations of all sizes, in all regions of the world, and across a broad array of industries. Our customers are located in more than 100 countries and, as of December 31, 2022, numbered more than 17,000.
 
We classify our customer base by size and geography:
 

■ | Small Business (“SMB”) segment. Companies with fewer than 500 user seats. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Mid-Market segment. Companies with greater than 500 but fewer than 5,000 user seats. 
■ | Enterprise segment. Companies with greater than 5,000 user seats. 
■ | Geography. Classification is based on the customer’s billing address and is divided into (1) North America; (2) Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); and (3) Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).

 Item 1
Research And Development 
 
We constantly seek to develop new offerings, drive improvements to our existing offerings, and enhance support of our existing customer deployments. We leverage agile development methodologies and work with the latest technologies, resulting in a dynamic, state of the art, automated software development process that has allowed us to quickly deliver high-quality products and services and adapt to market changes and new requirements. We believe delivering and expanding product functionality is critical to enhancing the success of existing customers while new product development further reinforces our breadth of solutions.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on contractual protections, such as license, assignment, and confidentiality agreements, and technical measures. We pursue the registration of domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States. We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers.
Competition
 
While certain companies offer products with features similar to those embedded in our individual solutions and with which we compete in certain tactical use cases, we do not believe that any company offers the same breadth of functionalities that we offer in a single integrated platform. Unlike traditional vendors primarily focused on data management, data governance, or migration, we address a spectrum of SaaS solutions and productivity applications for the digital workplace.
 
The standalone point solutions we frequently encounter often fail to meet the needs of our customers, due to limitations in breadth of functionality, ease of use, scalability, rigor of security protocols, integration with third-party applications and data sources, time to value and total cost of ownership.
 
Seasonality
 
Our quarterly revenue fluctuates and does not necessarily grow sequentially when measuring any one fiscal quarter’s revenue against another (e.g. comparing the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2021 against the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2022). Historically, our third and fourth quarters have been our highest revenue quarters, however those results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly revenue or full year results. Higher third and fourth quarter revenue is driven primarily by increased sales resulting from our customers’ fiscal year ends. Additionally, new product and service introductions (including the timing of those introductions) can significantly impact revenue. Revenue can also be affected when customers anticipate a product introduction. Our operating expenses have generally increased sequentially due to increases in personnel in connection with the expansion of our business.

Human Capital Resources
 
The success of our people is the success of our Company, making our talent strategy a core focus of our operations. We received accolades from multiple publications around the world designating us as a “best place to work” in 2022. Our key human capital objectives in managing our business includes attracting and developing top talent, engaging our team in an environment where they thrive, and integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion principles into our core operating practices.
 
Our values are long-held beliefs that guide the behaviors of our global teams and are foundational to our present and future success. These are not ‘statements on a wall’ but a true representation of how we act as a team:
 

■ | Agility: We value quick, informed decision-making to meet and exceed customer expectations. We subscribe to a growth mindset, which contributes to our entrepreneurial and learning spirit. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Passion: Drive and energy are contagious here; we are not just going through the motions. We do things that are impactful and, as a result, amplify our customers’ success. 
■ | Teamwork: We are invested in the success of our colleagues, partners, customers, and communities. We do this by promoting global collaboration and taking pride in helping, sharing, mentoring, and coaching each other.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 2,187 employees globally. A large percentage of our employees have technical and professional backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees. Our professional staff includes programmers, data and computer scientists, electrical and mechanical engineers, software and hardware specialists, project managers, sales and marketing professionals, attorneys, and CPAs. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. We are not aware of any employment circumstances that are likely to disrupt our work efforts. See the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report) for a discussion of the risks related to the loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
Recruitment and Internal Mobility
 
We want to attract a pool of diverse and exceptional candidates and support their career growth once they join our team. We seek to hire based on talent rather than solely on educational pedigree, and have provided many job openings, including in our local communities, for capable workers from various backgrounds to learn valuable skills in critical operations such as business development, sales, customer support, and customer service. In our evaluation and career development efforts, we also emphasize internal mobility opportunities for employees to drive professional development. Our goal is a long-term, upward-bound career for every employee, which we believe also drives our retention efforts. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage and incentivize employee referrals for open positions.
Rewards
 
We strive to provide globally a competitive suite of pay, comprehensive benefits, and services. We incentivize performance through a combination of competitive base pay, performance-based cash incentives and long-term incentives in the form of equity. We believe this combination fosters a strong sense of ownership, aligns the interests of employees with our stockholders, and increases stockholder value and our overall success.

Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
 
We recognize the importance of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters and how they impact our stakeholders. We believe appropriately responding to ESG issues is an important component of corporate social responsibility and comprehensive fiscal management. In light of the continued importance surrounding ESG matters, we are active in establishing and improving programs, practices and policies to maximize the benefit to AvePoint, our stockholders, our employees, and the communities we impact. We believe that strong ESG programs and practices are critical to attracting the best talent, executing on our strategies, maintaining a robust supplier and channel partner base, and innovating to meet our consumers’ evolving expectations.
 
AvePoint’s policies, practices and programs include engagement with external stakeholders to understand their priorities and obtain their feedback, coordination of relevant company projects and initiatives, and alignment with AvePoint’s strategies and implementation. In 2022, in furtherance of its commitment to ESG matters, AvePoint designated the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to oversee ESG matters, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee approved the charter for an ESG committee within AvePoint with the involvement of internal stakeholders.
 
In 2023, we expect to continue to explore, and report on, our efforts to expand on ESG opportunities. Our future ESG disclosures will be informed by an internal ESG prioritization assessment to be undertaken in 2023, which will assess topics based on their potential impact to both business value creation and environmental and societal impact more broadly.
 
To that end, AvePoint is committed to transparent reporting on ESG matters and, therefore, has provided additional disclosure below related to the goals and relevant metrics of our ESG program to allow our stakeholders to be informed about our progress.
 
1. Environmental
 
Workplace Practices
 
Across our twenty-five offices, we strive to reduce our environmental footprint, operate more efficiently, and engage our personnel in social initiatives that directly impact their lives. To fulfill our aim of integrating environmental sustainability into everything we do, we have implemented numerous projects across our operations, including a company-wide paperless campaign and a computer recycling project, to reduce energy consumption and the use of non-renewable resources in our workplaces. Our Jersey City headquarters and our Arlington and Chicago offices are LEED certified, and our Singapore office is a Green Mark Platinum building. In addition, our Japan office takes many steps to maximize its energy efficiency, including:

■ | Maintenance and inspection to maintain efficient operation and performance of facilities using BEMS data;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Operation with appropriate indoor temperature and humidity settings;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Introduction of LEDs in common areas;
--+--------------------------------------


■ | Replacement of heat sources and air conditioners with high-efficiency equipment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Implementation of energy conservation meetings among operators, management companies, and construction companies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Donation of carbon credits to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government under the cap-and-trade system (4,000 t-CO2)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Cloud Computing for the Good of All
 
AvePoint was an early mover to transition from traditional on-premises software solutions to software-as-a-service and hybrid deployments. Not only does cloud computing help meet the business needs of our customers, but it also has tremendous benefits to the environment, including greater energy efficiency, lower carbon emissions, and reduced carbon footprints.
 
In addition to many of AvePoint’s own workers saving resources by working remotely, our software supports customers in offering remote opportunities to their workforces, which helps them to reduce the environmental impacts of commuting and energy usage and waste production at physical worksites.
 
Looking forward, AvePoint is actively researching additional methods to reduce its carbon footprint and create a more sustainable future for the company and the communities we serve.

2. Social
 
As a global company, we have a tremendous opportunity – and responsibility – to do good. We strive to exemplify our core values of agility, passion and teamwork every day to ensure the success of our customers, partners, and stakeholders as well as make a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. To do this, we are committed to creating and empowering access to a variety of opportunities:
Philanthropy
 
As a global organization, AvePoint strives to create pathways to success for individuals and communities through education. At the heart of our work—volunteering, partnerships, donations, and advocacy—is the vision of a world where everyone, no matter where they live, which resources they have, or what challenging circumstances they face, has a path to self-reliance and resilience. Our partners range from organizations that advance education for underrepresented minorities across our industry, to those that champion public policies aimed at fostering innovation and growth. AvePoint is proud to support education as not only the great equalizer, but as the single most impactful catalyst to improving one’s trajectory. In 2022, we continued our partnership with Girls Who Code, an organization that is committed to building the largest pipeline of future female engineers and has engaged over 500,000 girls, women, and nonbinary individuals through in-person programming. We also partnered with StepNow, an organization dedicated to equipping young people with the necessary tools to step into adulthood in the United Kingdom, to provide youth with a 1-week internship in our London offices to learn more about working in the technology field.
Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Allyship
 
AvePoint is proud to employ talent from many different backgrounds, experiences, and identities. Diversity and inclusion drive our success and is at the core of how we hire, communicate and collaborate to deliver value and excellence. AvePoint is committed to fostering an environment where people can bring their whole selves to work and feel a sense of belonging. Through our employee resource groups, internal mobility opportunities across the countries in which we operate, and external partnerships with underrepresented minority networks, we continue to work toward creating a workforce that represents the diversity of our customers and communities. Through our IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Allyship) Committee, in 2022 we launched our newest employee resource group dedicated to driving greater awareness and connection with military veterans. Our employee resource groups also led the Company’s support of causes including The Trevor Project, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ youth, and The National Center for Children and Families, a nonprofit child and family welfare agency with a commitment to serving poor, disadvantaged, abused neglected and abandoned children, youth and their families. 
Supporting Agents of Change: Our Talent
 
AvePoint is committed to investing in our people and nurturing a growth mindset across our organization. Our talent development philosophy builds upon the idea that business growth and success come from a culture of collaboration and creativity, and that our people should feel empowered to craft their careers, make an impact, and own their futures. Our portfolio of learning and development programs equips our leaders and managers with the skills and confidence to lead high-performing teams, and supports our individual contributors with the tools and resources to contribute impactfully in their roles from the moment they join AvePoint.
3. Corporate Governance
 
Social Responsibility Support from the Top
 
At AvePoint, our corporate governance practices support our core values of agility, passion, and teamwork. These practices provide a framework for the proper operation of our company, consistent with our stockholders’ best interests and the requirements of law. 
 
AvePoint is committed to managing our affairs consistent with the highest principles of business ethics and the corporate governance requirements of both federal law and Nasdaq, including the following:

■ | A majority of our board members are independent of AvePoint and its management;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | All members of our three board committees—the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Governance Committee—are independent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | We have a clear code of business conduct to which all employees, officers and directors must adhere; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | The charters of our board committees clearly establish their respective roles and responsibilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2022, in support of these priorities, AvePoint:
 

■ | Adopted formal Independence Standards for its Board and the Board’s Audit Committee;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Completed a full review of its Corporate Governance policies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Updated its Code of Conduct to include additional key policies and methods of reporting violations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Introduced a more robust and user-friendly platform for whistleblowers and other reporting.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earning the World’s Trust
 
As a global company which is responsible to employees, stockholders and customers, our vision for AvePoint is to build an environment in which we earn trust and confidence every day through enabling collaboration and innovation through our commitment to privacy, security, and transparency.
 
Commitment to powering proactive data security programs
 
AvePoint understands the importance of security and operational risk management and is committed to providing organizations with relevant metrics which help them make decisions that are proactive rather than reactive. When done in conjunction with policies, education and measurement, organizations can balance collaboration and transparency with data protection and privacy. We seek to earn trust not just with robust security and privacy practices, but with the way we operate and organize our business.
 
Aligning to clear privacy principles
 
AvePoint has a policy of transparency regarding our data collection, use, retention and sharing practices. It is our commitment to implement appropriate technical security measures to protect all AvePoint stakeholders and manage third party risk. AvePoint uses this foundation and discipline to develop market-leading privacy and security products and deliver world class customer service. Our software, processes and services have obtained industry-leading security and privacy certifications, including System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type II, ISO 27001:2013 – Information Security, ISO 27017:015-Cloud Security, Information Security Registered Assessors (IRAP) Program, FedRAMP, and more. We have also implemented a rigorous program to assess our own vendors and suppliers.
 
Advancing cybersecurity
 
Cybersecurity is a central challenge as companies around the world embark on the digital transformation. Ransomware attacks have become one of the top security threats for organizations, especially as increased collaboration can lead to more vulnerabilities. The cost to recover stolen data can be millions of dollars, in addition to substantial reputational damage. AvePoint Ransomware Detection, and its Ransomware Warranty for MSP, which primarily serves small business clients, gives assurance that companies will be protected.
 
Strengthening our offerings by first strengthening ourselves
 
AvePoint has built a resilient, scalable and secure IT environment by investing in complementary industry leading technology and security solutions, in addition to utilizing our own software platform. In addition, AvePoint has built a corporate culture in which privacy and security are enablers of productivity, collaboration and trust; we balance the free flow of information with the risk of inappropriate access and/or disclosure; and we implement a risk-based approach to privacy and security that will allow us to maintain not only legal and regulatory compliance in the jurisdictions in which we operate, but also to facilitate business and innovation at AvePoint.

 Item 1
Compliance with Material Government Regulations
 
We are subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations that involve data privacy and data protection, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, health and safety, competition, consumer protection, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, environmental protection regulations, and securities law compliance. Our business may also be affected by the adoption of any new or existing laws or regulations or changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect our business. Many relevant laws and regulations are still evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created or amended in a manner that could harm our business, and new laws and regulations may be enacted, including in connection with the restriction or prohibition of certain content or business activities.
 
We are subject to certain U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy and the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data from users, employees or business partners, including the GDPR, CCPA, and VCDPA. These laws expand the rights of individuals to control how their personal data is processed, collected, used and shared, create new regulatory and operational requirements for processing personal data, increase requirements for security and confidentiality and provide for significant penalties for non-compliance. There are also a number of legislative proposals recently enacted or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislatures and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us. These and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply.
 
In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”). The FCPA prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in improper activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It prohibits, among other things, providing, directly or indirectly, anything of value to any foreign government official, or any political party or official thereof, or candidate for political influence to improperly influence such person. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the UK, that restrict improper payments to persons in the public or private sector. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. Historically, technology companies have been the target of FCPA and other anti-corruption investigations and penalties. We are further subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that restrict our activities in certain countries and with certain persons. These include the economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the export control laws administered by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry.
 
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section (Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report) for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from certain requirements related to executive compensation, including the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and to provide information relating to the ratio of total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, each as required by the Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010, which is part of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. We will take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period emerging growth company status permits.
 
During the extended transition period, it may be difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that complies with public company effective dates for accounting standard updates because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2024, (b) the last date of our fiscal year in which we have a total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (c) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC with at least $700.0 million of outstanding securities held by non-affiliates or (d) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years. The next determination date as to whether we have satisfied the criteria set forth in the foregoing (b), (c), and (d) is the last day of our second fiscal quarter in 2023.
