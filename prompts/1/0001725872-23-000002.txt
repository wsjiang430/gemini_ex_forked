ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
We are a financial technology (“fintech”) company that facilitates deposits and banking services between a customer and our partner bank, Customers Bank, which is a related party and is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured bank. We provide state-of-the-art high-tech digital banking and disbursement services to consumers and students nationwide through a full service fintech banking platform, accessible to customers anywhere and anytime through digital channels. Our fintech business model leverages Banking-as-a-Service (“BaaS”) partners’ and University partners’ existing customer bases to achieve high volume, low-cost customer acquisition in our Higher Education Disbursement, BaaS, and niche Direct to Consumer (“D2C") banking businesses.
We are not a bank, do not hold a bank charter, and do not provide banking services. Our partner bank, Customers Bank, is subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Bank, and is periodically examined by those regulatory authorities. We are subject to the regulations of the Department of Education (“ED”), due to our Disbursement business, and are periodically examined by them. 
BankMobile Technologies, Inc. (“BankMobile”) was incorporated in May 2016 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Customers Bank. On August 6, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and among Megalith Financial Acquisition Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company (“Megalith”), incorporated in Delaware in November 2017, MFAC Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Megalith, BankMobile Technologies, Inc., and Customers Bank, the sole stockholder of BankMobile. On January 4, 2021, BankMobile became an independent company after the completion of a divestiture transaction and was rebranded BM Technologies, Inc.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.

Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 275 full-time employees, all located in the United States, however technology has allowed us to expand our reach to include a larger demographic with more remote employees working outside of our physical locations and throughout the country. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The Company provides its employees with comprehensive benefits, some of which are provided on a contributory basis, including medical and dental plans, a 401(k) savings plan with a company match component, and short-term and long-term disability coverage. Additional benefits offered include paid time off, life insurance, and employee assistance. The Company's compensation package is designed to maintain market competitive total rewards programs for all employees in order to attract and retain superior talent.
