ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to AlphaVest Acquisition Corp.
 
General
 
AlphaVest Acquisition Corp is a blank check company incorporated on January 14, 2022, as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “Business Combination”). We may pursue an acquisition or a business combination with a target in any business or industry that can benefit from the expertise and capabilities of our management team. Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses will not be limited to a particular geographic region, although we intend to primarily focus on businesses in Asia. We have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.
 
On February 7, 2022, our AlphaVest Holding, LP (our “Sponsor”) acquired 1,725,000 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, which represents 20% of our issued and outstanding shares after our initial public offering (as defined below).
 
We also issued an aggregate of 125,000 founder shares to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (the “EBC founder shares”) on July 11, 2022 for an aggregate purchase price of $1,750. The EBC founder shares were deemed to be underwriters’ compensation by FINRA pursuant to Rule 5110 of the FINRA Manual. The EBC founder shares cannot be sold, transferred or assigned (except to the same permitted transferees as the founder shares and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees of the founder shares must agree to, each as described herein) until the consummation of an initial business combination.
 
As of the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”) and identifying a target for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.
 
The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 19, 2022 (the “Registration Statement”). On December 22, 2022 the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. Unit consists of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common stock”) and one right (the “Rights”), with each Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one share of Common Stock. Additionally, on December 29, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 900,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $9,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of private sale of 365,000 units (the “Private Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, and 25,000 Private Placement Units to EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EBC”) generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,900,000. In connection with the underwriter’s exercise of their over-allotment option, on December 29, 2022, the Company sold 37,904 Private Placement Units to the Sponsor, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Purchase Unit, and an additional 2,596 Private Placement Units to EBC, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Purchase Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $405,000.

Of the proceeds the Company received from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units, $70,380,000 ($10.20 per public share) was deposited into a U.S.-based trust account at UBS with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, with approximately $550,000 being used to pay fees and expenses in connection with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, including underwriting commissions, and an estimated $650,000 being available for working capital following the Initial Public Offering. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its tax obligations, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units that are deposited in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated articles of association (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 12 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination), subject to applicable law.
 
Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates. The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and potential target companies may defer or end discussions for a potential business combination with us whether or not COVID-19 affects their business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.
 
Our Management Team
 
For more information on the experience and background of our management team, see the section entitled “Management.”
 
Business Strategy
 
We will seek to capitalize on the strength of our management team. Our team consists of experienced financial services, accounting, and legal professionals, and senior operating executives of companies operating in multiple jurisdictions. Collectively, our officers and directors have decades of experience in mergers and acquisitions and in operating companies. We believe that their prior accomplishments and current activities will be critical in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities, and that, in turn, the businesses that we identify will be able to benefit from accessing the U.S. capital markets and the expertise and network of our management team. However, there is no assurance that we will complete an initial business combination. Our officers and directors have no prior experience consummating an initial business combination for a “blank check” company.
 
There is no restriction on the geographic location of the targets that we can pursue, although we intend to initially focus on target businesses in Asia. In particular, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination target on private companies in Asia that have compelling economics, clear paths to positive operating cash flow, significant assets, and successful management teams that are seeking access to the U.S. public capital markets.
 
As an emerging market, Asia has experienced remarkable growth. The Asian economy has experienced sustained expansion in recent years. We believe that Asia is entering a new era of economic growth, which we expect will result in attractive initial business combination opportunities for us. We believe the growth will primarily be driven by private sector expansion, technological innovation, increasing consumption by the middle class, structural economic and policy reforms and demographic changes, particularly in China.
 
The development of private equity and venture capital activities in Asia also provides us opportunities. According to the Asia-Pacific Private Equity Report 2022 issued by Bain & Company, Asia-Pacific private equity investors closed a record number of deals in 2021. Furthermore, the report states that investment and exit value set new highs for the region, and fund-raising rose slightly over 2020. Deal value increased significantly to a record $296 billion, up 50% over 2020 and 82% over the previous five-year average.

Acquisition Criteria
 
Our management team intends to focus on creating shareholder value by leveraging its experience in the management, operation, and financing of businesses to improve the efficiency of operations while implementing strategies to scale revenue organically and/or through acquisitions. We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines, which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see justification to do so.

● | Strong Management Team that Can Create Significant Value for Target Business. We will seek to identify companies with strong and experienced management teams that will complement the operating and investment abilities of our management team. We believe we can provide a platform for the existing management team to leverage the experience of our management team. We also believe that the operating expertise of our management team is well suited to complement many potential targets’ management teams. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of both existing and new product development, increased production capacity, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage. 


● | Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable, and increasing free cash flow, particularly businesses with predictable revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance shareholder value. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to only acquire a business or businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and which can effectively utilize access to broader sources of capital and a public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. 

 
These criteria do not intend to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, and criteria that our sponsor and management team may deem relevant.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
We will have up to 12 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, we may, by resolution of our Board of Directors and if requested by our sponsor, extend the period of time we will have to consummate an initial business combination up to two times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 18 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering), provided that, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on December 19, 2022, in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $690,000, (or $0.10 per share) for each extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Our public shareholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any such extension. In the event that our sponsor elects to extend the time to complete an initial business combination, pay the additional amounts per each extension, and deposit the applicable amount of money into trust, our sponsor will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note in the amount of any such deposit, which will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close an initial business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our sponsor five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the private units will expire and be worthless.

-


Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding income interest earned on the Trust Account and released to us to pay taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
The net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private units released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following consummation of our Initial Public Offering. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. We have granted EBC a right of first refusal under certain circumstances for a period commencing from the consummation of our Initial Public Offering until the consummation of our initial business combination (or the liquidation of the trust account in the event that we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the prescribed time period) to act as book running manager, placement agent and/or arranger for all financings where we seek to raise equity, equity-linked, debt or mezzanine financings relating to or in connection with an initial business combination. We are otherwise not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. None of our initial shareholders are required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
We intend to utilize the expertise of our managements’ respective platforms to evaluate potential targets’ strengths, weaknesses, and to identify the relative risk and return profile of any potential target for our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has contractual obligations to other entities, and any of them in the future may have additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities including other special purpose acquisition companies, or “SPACs” pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present an initial business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity.
 

4
-


Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one that we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
Our officers have agreed that they will not become an officer or director of any other special purpose acquisition company that has publicly filed a registration statement for its initial public offering unless and until we enter into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete an initial business combination).
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. This may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 420 Lexington Avenue, Suite 2446, New York NY, 10170. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we will pay to our sponsor for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have two officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We will register our units, Common stock and rights under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC on December 16, 2022 to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700,000,000 as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non- convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700,000,000 as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.

Risk Factors Summary
 
We are a newly incorporated company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. Until we complete our initial business combination, we will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues. In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the background of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company.
 
Since we may initiate a business combination with a target company operating in China, we may be subject to additional risk factors. These include significant regulatory, liquidity, and enforcement risks. For example, we face risks arising from the legal system in China, including risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and that rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice. In addition, the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time or exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our common stock. Any actions by the Chinese government to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. For a detailed description of the risks relating to acquiring and operating a target business in China, see Please see “Risks Related to Our Possible Business Combination in China” and “Risks Related to Acquiring and Operating a Business Outside of the United States” for more information.
 
You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. Such risks include, but are not limited to:
 
Risks Related to our Search for, Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination
 

● | Our public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public shareholders do not support such a combination. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and private shares in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote. 
● | Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless we seek shareholder approval of the initial business combination. 
● | The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable initial business combination or optimize our capital structure. 
● | Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate an initial business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the status of debt and equity markets, as well as protectionist legislation in our target markets. 
● | The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of our IPO (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete an initial business combination) may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating an initial business combination and may decrease our ability to conduct due diligence on potential initial business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline. 
● | We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up. 
● | You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate your investment, therefore, you may be forced to sell your public shares or rights potentially at a loss. 
● | If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a “group” of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our common stock. 
● | Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination and our rights will expire worthless. 
● | We may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors which may be outside of our management’s area of expertise. 


7
-


● | Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Because we are not limited to a particular industry, sector, or any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations. 
● | Our ability to complete a business combination may be impacted by the fact that our sponsor’s major shareholder, Pengfei Zheng, is a non-U.S. person, and a majority of our officers and directors are located in, or have significant ties to, China. This may make us a less attractive partner to potential target companies outside the PRC, thereby limiting our pool of acquisition candidates and making it harder for us to complete an initial business combination with a non-China-based target company. For example, we may not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company since such initial business combination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), or ultimately prohibited. 

Risks Related to Our Securities
 

● | We may issue additional common stock or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination, which would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

Risks Related to Our Management
 

● | Our officers and directors may allocate their time to other businesses and may become officers or directors of any other special purpose acquisition companies, thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs and whether to present potential target to us instead of to our competitors. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our initial shareholders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests. 
● | We are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. 

Post Business Combination Risks
 

● | Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We may seek acquisition opportunities with an early-stage company, a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings.

Risks Related to Acquiring and Operating a Business Outside of the United States
 

● | Because of the costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations, our results of operations may be negatively impacted. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Many countries have difficult and unpredictable legal systems and underdeveloped laws and regulations that are unclear and subject to corruption and inexperience, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
● | We may face additional and distinctive risks if we acquire a business in certain industries, such as technology. 
● | If we effect our initial business combination with a business located in the PRC, the laws applicable to such business will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights. 


● | PRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our ability to inject capital in our Chinese subsidiaries and Chinese subsidiaries’ ability to change their registered capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us or our PRC resident beneficial owners to liability and penalties under PRC laws. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Certain existing or future U.S. laws and regulations may restrict or eliminate our ability to complete an initial business combination with certain companies, particularly those target companies in China. 
● | If any dividend is declared in the future and paid in a foreign currency, you may be taxed on a larger amount in U.S. 
● | If we effect an initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights. 
● | Changes in the policies, regulations, rules, and the enforcement of laws of the PRC government may occur quickly with little advance notice and could have a significant impact upon our ability to operate profitably in the PRC. 
● | The Chinese government may intervene in and influence the manner in which our post-combination entity must conduct its business activities in ways that we cannot expect when we enter into a definitive agreement with a target company with major operation in China which could result in a material change in our operations of the combined company and/or the value of our securities, and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. If the Chinese government establishes some new policies, regulations, rules, or laws affecting the industries that our post-combination entity is in, it may materially and adversely affect our operations and the value of our common stock. 
● | Chinese government agencies may exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers. Additional compliance procedures and approvals may be required in connection with our Initial Public Offering and our initial business combination process, and, if required, we cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain such approval. As a result, both you and us face uncertainty about future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 
● | In light of recent events indicating greater oversight by the Cybersecurity Administration of Chine (the “CAC”) over data security, particularly for companies seeking to list on a foreign exchange, some internet and technology companies may not be willing to list on a U.S. exchange or enter into a definitive business combination agreement with us. Further, we may also have to avoid an initial business combination with a company with more than one million users’ personal information in China due to the limited timeline for us to complete a business combination. 
● | Governmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of your investment.
