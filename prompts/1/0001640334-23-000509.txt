ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate Overview

We incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 2, 2011, and are presently based in the County of San Diego, California. We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutics that target lipid-signaling pathways, including the endocannabinoid system (the “ECS”), a family of receptors and neurotransmitters that form a biochemical communication network throughout the body. 

Our product candidate pipeline broadly leverages leading scientific methodologies and balances risk across mechanism of action and stages of development. Our programs represent a comprehensive approach in utilizing the power and promise of lipid signaling to develop pharmaceuticals for patients with unmet healthcare needs. We are currently developing a dual cannabinoid agonist. This synthetic small molecule program is a G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) designated ART27.13.  We are developing ART27.13 as a potential treatment for anorexia associated with cancer in a Phase 1b/2a trial, titled the Cancer Appetite Recovery Study (“CAReS”). Our second program, ART26.12 is a small molecule and the lead product candidate from our chemical library of inhibitors of fatty acid binding proteins, notably Fatty Acid Binding Protein 5 (“FABP5”), undergoing pre-clinical research as a potential treatment for painful neuropathies.  In addition, ART26.12 may have broad applications as a cancer therapeutic, a treatment for pain and inflammation, and potential use in anxiety-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. We are also developing our own invention ART12.11 (the “CBD cocrystal”). ART 12.11 is our patented solid-state composition of cannabidiol (“CBD”). 

We obtained two of our patent protected product candidates through our in-licensing activities. Our first in-licensed program, ART27.13, is being developed for cancer-related anorexia. ART27.13 is a peripherally-restricted high-potency dual CB1 and CB2 receptor full-receptor agonist, which was originally invented at AstraZeneca plc (“AstraZeneca”). We exercised our option to exclusively license this GPCR product candidate through the NEOMED Institute (“NEOMED”), a Canadian not-for-profit corporation, renamed adMare Bioinnovations (“adMare”) in June 2019, which had obtained rights to ART27.13. In Phase 1, single dose studies in healthy volunteers and a multiple ascending dose study in individuals with chronic low back pain conducted by AstraZeneca, ART27.13 exhibited an attractive pharmacokinetic and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profile and was well tolerated within the target exposure range. It also exhibited dose-dependent and potentially clinically meaningful increases in body weight. Importantly, the changes in body weight were not associated with fluid retention or other adverse effects and occurred at exposures without central nervous system (“CNS”) side effects. Discussions with UK, US and Canadian regulators indicate there is a potential pathway for development of ART27.13 for the treatment of cancer-related anorexia, which affects approximately 60% of advanced stage cancer patients.

We commenced enrollment and dosed the first patient in CAReS, our Phase 1b/2a clinical study of cancer-related anorexia with ART27.13 in April 2021. We have been enrolling patients steadily since that time. The results of the Phase 1b stage are intended to determine the most effective and safe dose recommended for the Phase 2a portion of CAReS. After we completed enrollment of the planned first three dosing cohorts, per the approved protocol, we elected to enroll a fourth cohort of six patients at a higher dose before making a determination as to which dose is selected for the Phase 2a stage of CAReS. We experienced minor delays due to COVID-19; however, we do not foresee significant ongoing impacts, and anticipate commencing enrollment in the stage two portion of CAReS during the first half of 2023.  We are aware the situation could change and we are working to mitigate any adverse effects that may materialize due to the pandemic or its aftermath or any other global disruption.

Our second in-licensed patented program is from our platform of small-molecule inhibitors of fatty acid binding proteins, notably FABP5 acquired from Stony Brook University (“SBU”), and our lead program is designated ART26.12. To date, SBU has received approximately $8.0 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health to develop these candidates including a $4.2 million grant in 2020 to advance research of FABP5 inhibition in prostate cancer. Fatty acid binding proteins (“FABPs”) are attractive therapeutic targets, however, the high degree of sequence and structural similarities among family members have made the creation of drugs targeting specific FABPs challenging. FABP5 is believed to specifically target and regulate one of the body’s endogenous cannabinoids, anandamide (“AEA”). While searching for a FABP5 inhibitor to regulate AEA, researchers at SBU discovered the chemistry for creating a large library of compounds which we believe to be highly specific and potent small molecule inhibitors of FABP5 and other isoforms. In addition to its potential as a synthetic endocannabinoid modulator with development targeting pain, inflammation, and anxiety, FABP5 plays an important role in lipid signaling and is believed to be an attractive strategy for cancer drug development. Large amounts of human biomarker and animal model data support FABP5 as an oncology target, including triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and castration-resistant prostate cancer. We licensed exclusive world-wide rights to these inhibitors from SBU in all fields. Through our sponsored research we have subsequently identified a potential role for FABP5 inhibition to treat anxiety disorders, such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”). We have also been awarded a research grant in Canada to expand on our earlier research at the University of Western Ontario in this new development area. Based upon recently disclosed positive pre-clinical evidence of promising activity and a differentiated mechanism-of-action for the prevention and treatment of Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (“CIPN”), we have prioritized CIPN as the initial indication for development of our lead product candidate, ART26.12. CIPN is a significant unmet need, often resulting in anti-cancer treatment delays or discontinuations, and there are currently no approved treatments for CIPN from the regulatory authorities in the US, UK or EU.  The ART26.12 program is in the beginning stages of regulatory-enabling studies. We anticipate first-in-human studies could begin in the middle of 2024 depending, in part, on the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic , the ability of selected contract research organizations to source materials and resources, including animals, in order to perform required studies, and the review and approval process with the regulatory authorities, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainties in the expected timelines for clinical stage biopharmaceutical companies such as us, and because of such uncertainties, we are unable to predict our expected timelines with any degree of certainty at this time.

In addition to our in-licensed programs, we have internal discovery research initiatives which resulted in ART12.11, a proprietary cocrystal composition of CBD. The crystal structure of CBD is known to exhibit solid polymorphism, or the ability to manifest in different forms. Polymorphism can adversely affect stability, dissolution, and bioavailability of a drug product and thus may affect its quality, safety, and efficacy. Based upon our research, we believe our CBD cocrystal exists as a single crystal form and as such is anticipated to have advantages over other solid forms of CBD that exhibit polymorphism. Anticipated advantages of this single crystal structure include improved stability, solubility, and a more consistent absorption profile. We believe these features will result in more consistent and improved bioavailability and may lead to improved safety and efficacy.

Presently, we have two US patents, one US patent application, and eight foreign patent applications directed to our cocrystal composition of CBD. Composition claims are generally known in the pharmaceutical industry as the most desired type of intellectual property and should provide for long lasting market exclusivity for our synthetic CBD cocrystal drug product candidate. In addition, due to the reasons outlined above, we believe that our synthetic CBD cocrystal will have superior pharmaceutical properties compared to non-cocrystal CBD products under development at other competing companies to treat cancer, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (“IBD”), PTSD, and other potential indications.

We are developing our product candidates in accordance with traditional regulated drug development standards and expect to make them available to patients via prescription or physician orders only after obtaining marketing authorization from a regulatory authority, such as the FDA. Our management team has experience developing, commercializing, and partnering ethical pharmaceutical products, including several first-in-class therapeutics. Based upon our current management’s capabilities and the future talent we may attract, we expect to retain rights to internally develop and commercialize products; however, we may seek collaborations with partners in the biopharmaceutical industry when that strategy serves to maximize value for our stockholders.

Background

The ECS is composed of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous receptor ligands (“endocannabinoids”) and their associated transporter mechanisms, as well as enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids and has emerged as a considerable target for pharmacotherapy approaches of numerous human diseases. As a widespread modulatory and lipid-signaling system, the ECS plays important roles in the CNS, development, synaptic plasticity, and the response to endogenous and environmental factors.

The modulation of the ECS can be affected by using selective or non-selective agonists, partial agonists, inverse agonists, and antagonists of the cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptor is distributed in brain areas associated with motor control, emotional responses, motivated behavior and energy homeostasis. In the periphery, CB1 is ubiquitously expressed in the adipose tissue, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, skeletal muscles, heart and the reproductive system. The CB2 receptor is mainly expressed in the immune system regulating its functions and is upregulated in response to tissue stress or damage in most cell types. The ECS is therefore involved in pathophysiological conditions in both the central and peripheral tissues.

The actions of endogenous ligands can be enhanced or attenuated by targeting mechanisms that are associated with their transport within the cellular and extra cellular matrix as well as their synthesis and breakdown. Small molecule chemical modulators of the ECS can be derived from plants (phytocannabinoids), can be semi-synthetic derivatives of phytocannabinoids or endocannabinoids, or can be completely synthetic new chemical entities. We plan to develop approaches within our portfolio that address receptor binding and endocannabinoid transport modulation using only synthetic new chemical entities. Future approaches may also involve targeting synthesis or breakdown enzymes.

ECS targeting cannabinoid-based medicines are already approved and used to treat numerous medical conditions. The ECS is further implicated in many disease states within the peer reviewed literature including conditions which involve the regulation of food intake, central nervous system, pain, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune and inflammation, behavioral, antiproliferative and reproductive functions. These areas of ECS pathophysiology are aligned with our therapeutic areas of focus: anxiety, pain, inflammation, anorexia, and cancer.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to develop and commercialize ethical pharmaceutical products that provide physicians access to the therapeutic potential lipid signaling of modulators, including modulating the ECS. We intend to pursue technologies and compounds that offer promising therapeutic approaches to known and validated signaling pathways, specifically lipid signaling which includes compounds that promote the effectiveness of the ECS. While many of our programs are directed towards improving the lives of people suffering with cancer and cancer treatments, the Company’s portfolio may ultimately be used to treat a wide range of diseases and conditions where leveraging the ECS is particularly useful.

The NEOMED Relationship

On December 20, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with NEOMED (the “NEOMED Agreement”), which provides the Company with up to twelve months from the date of receipt by the Company of the required materials to conduct certain non-clinical research studies, diligence and technical analyses with NEOMED’s proprietary therapeutic compound NEO1940, now known as ART27.13 (the “Compound”) and an option (the “NEOMED Option”) for an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products comprising or containing the Compound. The NEOMED Agreement has an effective date of January 2, 2018 (the “NEOMED Effective Date”). On the NEOMED Effective Date, the Company issued 15,000 shares of its common stock (on a pre-reverse stock split basis) to NEOMED. Pursuant to the terms of the NEOMED Agreement, within 30 days after the NEOMED Effective Date, NEOMED, without additional consideration and at its sole cost, delivered to the Company certain technology transfer materials and the quantity of the Compound substance specified in a research plan, both as set out under the NEOMED Agreement.

On January 4, 2019, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Material and Data Transfer, Option and License Agreement by and between us and NEOMED (the “First Amendment to NEOMED Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue NEOMED shares of our common stock as consideration for the waiver by NEOMED of the cash payment of $100,000 that was due to NEOMED on October 1, 2018. The Company issued 61,297 shares of common stock (on a pre-reverse stock split basis) to NEOMED in connection with the Company’s exercise of the NEOMED Option. The Company also issued 11,363 shares of common stock (on a pre-reverse stock split basis) to NEOMED pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment to NEOMED Agreement. Pursuant to the NEOMED Agreement, in July 2019, the Company completed a payment of $1,500,000 to NEOMED for the exercise of the NEOMED Option. Upon exercise of the NEOMED Option, NEOMED provided the Company with an exclusive worldwide license under all of NEOMED’s intellectual property rights covering the Compound (“Licensed IP Rights”) to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import products containing the Compound and otherwise exploit the Licensed IP Rights worldwide, in all fields.

In connection with the NEOMED Agreement, additional potential payments of up to two hundred million dollars will be due upon the achievement of certain regulatory, commercial, and sales milestones. Additionally, we may pay mid-to high-single digit royalties on annual net sales of any product successfully developed.

In clinical development studies with NEOMED’s prior sponsor, ART27.13 was dosed in over 200 subjects. From 2007 to 2008, ART27.13 was evaluated in five phase 1 clinical trials under its original sponsor, AstraZeneca. ART27.13 was administered orally in 205 patients and its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated. Four of these studies were single dose or Single Ascending Dose (“SAD”) studies. An initial SAD study was conducted in the UK. The program was completed with another study performed in a Japanese population. The two other single dose studies aimed at measuring a pharmacodynamics effect (Proof-of-Principle or POP studies) on analgesia using the capsaicin test in one case, and the third molar extraction model in the other case. The last phase 1 study was a Multiple Ascending Dose (“MAD”) study, where patients with chronic lower back pain received ART27.13 for a scheduled period of 12 days. Further details of the studies are found in Table 1.

___________

ART27.13 demonstrated, in general, an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the safety endpoints. The profile of the observed safety effects was generally typical of cannabinoids and the majority of the adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity. A maximum tolerated dose was defined by the frequency and severity of adverse events. A dose dependent increase in body weight was observed in the MAD study. In three out of the five phase 1 studies, analgesia in acute pain models was also measured as an endpoint; no convincing analgesic efficacy was seen in any of these studies.

The Stony Brook University Relationship

On January 18, 2018, we entered into a license agreement (the “Stony Brook Agreement”) with the Research Foundation at Stony Brook University (the “Foundation”) which agreement became effective on that same date. The Stony Brook Agreement provides us with an exclusive license under certain licensed patents of the Foundation  to develop, make, manufacture, have made, use, sell, have sold, import, export, and offer for sale Patent Product(s) (as defined in the Stony Brook Agreement) and Other Product(s) (as defined in the Stony Brook Agreement) worldwide in all fields, including without limitation the field of human therapeutics. The Stony Brook Agreement has an effective date of January 18, 2018 (the “SBU Effective Date”).

8


Pursuant to the Stony Brook Agreement, we paid an upfront fee and are paying to the Foundation annual license maintenance fees, beginning on the first anniversary of the SBU Effective Date and annually thereafter on each anniversary of the SBU Effective Date.

We will also be required to pay a low-single digit royalty on net sales on any patent products (the “Royalties”). The Stony Brook Agreement provides for a reduction of the Royalties in certain cases. We will also pay to the Foundation, beginning in the first calendar year of the first commercial sales, an annual minimum royalty fee (the “Annual Minimum Royalty”). The Annual Minimum Royalty will be credited against the total Royalties due for the calendar year in which the Annual Minimum Royalty is paid.

We will also be required to make payments for the following milestones:

The term of the Stony Brook Agreement commenced on the SBU Effective Date and will continue until the Stony Brook Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 

Research & Development

We intend to combine innovative science and accelerated clinical development to create and develop novel therapies using small molecule drug development strategies targeting lipid signaling pathways and the ECS. Our current research and development efforts have been limited to investigative work surrounding lipid signaling, including creating and developing novel and synthetic formulations, and evaluating potential opportunities to license technologies from pharmaceutical companies and leading research institutions. Our principal research efforts to date have been with the Stony Brook University, New York, University of Western Ontario, Canada, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland and with various clinical research organizations (“CROs”) in the US, China, Spain, and UK.
Scientific Approach

We intend to create, acquire, and develop a full spectrum of therapeutics, each of which has the potential to modulate lipid signaling for human health. The principal scientific platforms of our strategy are as follows: 

· | New Chemical Entities. We expect to license intellectual property rights for research stage platforms and new chemical entities developed within leading academic institutions under which we may develop programs that target endogenous signaling pathways, including molecules that modulate the ECS. These programs may involve the use of compounds which are neither plant-based nor synthetically-derived cannabinoids, but are instead compounds that have been shown to have promising potential in signaling pathways. Our initiatives for this strategy led us to the license novel technology from Stony Brook University, which we expect to be a core platform for the Company. We currently designate this program ART26.12. We also plan to acquire rights to intellectual property for research and clinical stage assets developed within the pharmaceutical industry and leading research institutions for synthetic small molecules, new chemical entities or alternatives to plant-based cannabinoids. Our efforts to secure rights to synthetic novel compounds led us to the NEOMED Agreement with NEOMED for the Compound, ART27.13.

Our Board and management have experience developing and commercializing ethical pharmaceutical products, including several first-in-class therapeutics. As we build our pipeline and advance our research and clinical development programs, we will evaluate partnerships with large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies where applicable. Based upon our management’s current experience and the future talent we may attract, we plan to retain rights to develop and commercialize products on our own. However, we will seek to collaborate with biopharmaceutical partners should that strategy serve to maximize the value for our stockholders.

Two of our development programs were licensed from established and respected organizations that have already conducted pre-clinical research and, in some cases, clinical research. Our science and regulatory teams are leveraging this research to speed development and commercialization timelines across our growing portfolio. Our current pipeline encompasses multiple mechanisms for endocannabinoid system modulation. The specific programs that are currently in development are set forth below.


· | ART27.13 – ART27.13 is our name for the synthetic GPCR agonist compound formerly known as NEO1940 and AZD1940. We intend to develop a synthetic formulation suitable for treatment of anorexia/weight loss associated with cancer. ART27.13 has been in 205 subjects in prior clinical studies and is currently enrolling in a Phase 1b/2a study in anorexia associated with cancer. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | ART26.12 – Our FABP5 inhibitor program is intended for treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer, neuropathic and nociceptive pain and anxiety disorders, including PTSD. Our near-term goal is to develop our lead development compound and assess its activity in models of cancer and pain. While advancing our lead, additional compound(s) may be identified and selected for advancement in regulatory-enabling studies. 
· | ART12.11 – Our novel solid-state CBD composition coformed with tetramethylpyrazine (“TMP”) is targeted for development in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”), and rare/orphan diseases. The rare/orphan disease strategy is supported by recent FDA actions with other company programs containing CBD, however, we intend to prioritize pain conditions associated with inflammation and neurologic conditions such as epilepsy and PTSD. In addition, interesting data was observed in anti-cancer models and the Company is continuing to explore this potential development strategy.

Competition

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and an emphasis on proprietary products. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

We plan to compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnological and other related markets with therapeutics that demonstrate clinical utility, have an acceptable safety profile and target commercially attractive indications characterized by previously unmet medical need.


10


Our potential competitors, which include pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies such as Novartis International AG, Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc., NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Jazz Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Tetra Bio-Pharma Inc. may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory agencies for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.

Government Regulation

United States

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the implementing regulations promulgated thereunder. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:


· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
· | approval by an institutional review board representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
· | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA requesting marketing approval for one or more proposed indications, including the payment of application user fees; 
· | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
· | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
· | securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 
· | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 


11

Foreign Jurisdictions

In addition to regulations in the United States, a manufacturer is subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions to the extent they choose to sell any drug products in those foreign countries. Even if a manufacturer obtains FDA approval of a product, it must still obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. For other countries, outside of the European Union, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary.

In the European Union, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. On the other hand, a decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. United States governmental authorities that enforce the FCPA, including the Department of Justice, deem most health care professionals and other employees of foreign hospitals, clinics, research facilities and medical schools in countries with public health care or public education systems to be “foreign officials” under the FCPA. Accordingly, when we interact with foreign health care professionals and researchers in testing and marketing our product candidates abroad, we must have policies and procedures in place sufficient to prevent us and agents acting on our behalf from providing any bribe, gift or gratuity, including excessive or lavish meals, travel or entertainment in connection with marketing our products and services or securing required permits and approvals such as those needed to initiate clinical trials in foreign jurisdictions.
International Laws

In Europe, and throughout the world, other countries have enacted anti-bribery laws and/or regulations similar to the FCPA. Violations of any of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.

There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.

Other Healthcare Laws

Our business operations and current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, consultants, customers and patients, may expose us to broadly applicable state and federal fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws constrain the business and financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our products. Such laws include:

· | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a U.S. healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act;

· | U.S. federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which, among other things, impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label; 
· | the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the health care fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
· | in addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers as well as their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information; 
· | the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members; and 
· | analogous state and non-U.S. laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by the patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and state and non-U.S. laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that some of our business practices, including our promotional activities and interactions with our customers do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, additional integrity reporting and oversight obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the above occur, it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

U.S. Healthcare Reform

In the U.S. and some non-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.

Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. For example, in the U.S., in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers.

There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the current administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In December of 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate had been repealed, and on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether other reforms enacted as part of the ACA but not specifically related to the individual mandate or health insurance could be severed from the rest of the ACA so as not to be declared invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, heard oral arguments on November 10, 2020 and issued a decision on June 17, 2021, effectively upholding the constitutionality of the ACA. It is unclear how this result, similar litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation.

Further, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to bring transparency to product pricing and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs, as well as several recent Executive Orders signed by President Trump. Additionally, individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs.
