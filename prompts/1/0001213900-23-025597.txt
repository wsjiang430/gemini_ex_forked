ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Description of Our Business



Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Actinium”) is a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted radiotherapies to deliver cancer-killing radiation with cellular level precision to treat patients with high unmet medical needs. Our vision is to build a specialty, hospital focused radiotherapeutics company that develops and markets medicines for relapsed or refractory cancer patients who are treated primarily in large quaternary care hospitals and their catchment areas. We intend to leverage the clinical data of our lead product candidates, Iomab-B and Actimab-A, to improve outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (“r/r AML”) by launching two radiotherapy drugs in 5 years that address the significant need for better outcomes from treatment with therapeutics or from undergoing a bone marrow transplant (“BMT”).



We also intend during this time frame to further advance Iomab-B outside of acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) based on promising data as a disease control and conditioning agent for various other blood cancers. Based on early promising clinical trial results, we are also working on a lower dose next generation conditioning program, Iomab-ACT, for rapidly growing cell and gene therapies.



Our Clinical Pipeline






AML is an aggressive, heterogeneous disease that is difficult-to-treat. Most AML patients develop relapsed or refractory disease within one year and have an extremely poor prognosis and dismal survival. Currently, a BMT is the only curative regimen available for AML patients, however, access is limited to AML patients who are fit enough to withstand the challenges associated with this treatment. The majority of AML patients are considered not transplantable in routine clinical practice as they are not fit enough to withstand the rigors of the patient journey which includes: therapy to attain a remission, conditioning regimens to destroy diseased marrow, challenge of the transplant itself or post-transplant complications.



Our Iomab-B and Actimab-A product candidates fill the major unmet medical needs in r/r AML in a complementary fashion as they are directed at different parts of the patient journey. Iomab-B is a targeted bridging therapy that provides both disease control and conditioning in one agent. Results from a phase 3 trial has demonstrated unprecedented access to a BMT and improved survival in unfit patients who are currently not considered transplantable in routine clinical practice. Actimab-A is a targeted therapy for fit patients that has demonstrated an impressive extension in survival in a proof-of-concept study and is poised for advanced development in collaboration with the NCI, or National Cancer Institute. Together, they provide us the opportunity to transform the treatment of AML, especially in the relapsed and refractory segment which represents over 50% of AML patients.

On October 31, 2022, we announced topline results from the pivotal Phase 3 Study of Iomab-B in Elderly Relapsed or Refractory AML or SIERRA trial, which demonstrated that Iomab-B met the primary endpoint of durable Complete Remission (“dCR”) with a high degree of statistical significance (p<0.0001). On February 18, 2023, we announced full trial results, demonstrating unprecedented access, improved outcomes and better safety and tolerability with double 1-year and median overall survival (“OS”) compared to control arm patients receiving Iomab-B at the 2023 Tandem Meetings aka the Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Meetings of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (“ASTCT”) and the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research (“CIBMTR”). We believe these results provide the opportunity to establish Iomab-B as a new standard of care, and if approved, we intend to commercialize the product in the United States (“U.S.”).



On April 12, 2022, we announced a commercialization agreement for Iomab-B with Immedica AB (“Immedica”) for exclusive rights in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (“EUMENA”). Actinium received an upfront payment of $35 million USD with the potential for an additional $417 million USD in regulatory and sales milestones and mid-twenty percent royalties. The market in the EU region is attractive due to the higher incidence of AML and number of BMT procedures compared to the U.S. with the same unmet patient need, and our partnership with Immedica positions us well to capitalize on this opportunity.



Actimab-A is the industry-leading program, leveraging the potent alpha radiation emitting isotope Actinium-225 (“Ac-225”) based on clinical development in approximately 150 patients treated over 6 clinical trials. The potent linear energy transfer emitted by Ac-225 has no known resistance mechanism. Actimab-A is being developed in combination with other regimens to exploit mechanistic synergies and leverage the mutation-agnostic mechanism of action of Ac-225 with the objective of establishing it as a backbone therapy in AML, an extremely heterogenous disease.



On December 10, 2022, we shared the Phase 1 results from the Actimab-A CLAG-M combination trial at the American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting & Exposition that showed high response rates and minimal residual disease (“MRD”) negativity, translating to a meaningful survival benefit of 53%and 32%at one and two years in patients who are typically expected to live two to four months. At the same meeting, we shared Phase 1 data showing that the combination of Actimab-A + venetoclax was well-tolerated with responses, including a Complete Remission (“CR”) and a partial response in early dose escalation cohorts. We believe the promise of these results paved the way for the NCI Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”), announced on February 6, 2023, to develop Actimab-A for the treatment of patients with AML and other hematologic malignancies.



Our differentiated R&D is further exemplified by our next-generation Iomab-ACT conditioning program for rapidly growing cell and gene therapies, as well as our solid tumor and immunotherapy collaborations with Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”), AVEO Oncology/LG Chem (“LG Chem”) and EpicentRx, Inc. (“EpicentRx”). In addition, we have several other programs in solid tumors at the pre-clinical stage with investigational new drug (“IND”) enabling studies ongoing and our extensive intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio includes over 200 issued patents and pending patent applications worldwide.



We are actively working on launching an early access program (“EAP”) for Iomab-B and intend to file a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) by year-end while preparing for a U.S. commercial launch and working with our partner Immedica to support the Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) and commercialization in the EU. Late-stage Actimab-A development is expected to begin in the second half of 2023 under the NCI CRADA and is anticipated to have a material balance sheet sparing impact over the next several years. We expect to create significant value due to the combination of major milestones and balance sheet strength with the approximately $100 million cash on hand at year-end 2022 projected to fund operations through 2025 as we continue to drive ahead with realizing our five-year plan.



Market Opportunity



The market opportunity for Iomab-B and Actimab-A, as depicted in the diagram below, exists in AML and for cellular therapy conditioning in various blood cancers. We believe that Iomab-B and Actimab-A can fill the major unmet medical needs in r/r AML in a complementary fashion as they are utilized in different parts of the patient treatment journey. The incidence of AML is approximately 21,000 patients per year, with a prevalence of approximately 70,000 in the U.S., (approximately 27,500 new patients per year in Europe) and the disease has an outsized economic impact relative to its population size. Over 50% of patients diagnosed with AML will develop relapsed or refractory disease, with a median age of 68 years at diagnosis. Despite 10 new approved therapies since 2017, no significant advancements have been made toward a cure and there is a significant unmet need for better therapeutics, which provide the opportunity for Actimab-A. Actimab-A is a targeted radiotherapy for fit patients that has demonstrated an impressive improvement in survival in a proof-of-concept study and is poised for advanced development in collaboration with the NCI. Using Actimab-A in combination with chemotherapy or a targeted therapy, we have the potential opportunity to treat both newly diagnosed or r/r AML patients, with the potential addressable population comparable to the prevalence of patients with AML.

Today, less than 20% of AML patients are able to access a BMT, currently the only potentially curative option. These patients are usually younger, fit, and able to withstand the challenges associated with this treatment, leaving the large majority of AML patients ineligible for transplant. This provides an opportunity for Iomab-B, which has demonstrated the ability to enable unfit patients to benefit from a BMT. Thus Iomab-B can potentially expand the market from the approximately 400 r/r AML patients who are transplanted currently to approximately 8,000 unfit patients that could be eligible for transplant. Iomab-B has demonstrated the ability to improve BMT access with extended survival and potentially curative outcomes in several other hematological diseases outside of AML. Several clinical trials in over 300 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”), acute lymphocytic leukemia (“ALL”), Hodgkin’s lymphoma (“HL”), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) and multiple myeloma (“MM”) have demonstrated the same value proposition as in AML. This data provides an opportunity to expand the market for Iomab-B beyond AML via label expansion. In the U.S., there are approximately 185,000 patients diagnosed with blood cancers (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma) that are treatable with BMT, of which, only approximately 20,000 are transplanted, leaving greater than 165,000 patients who could potentially benefit from transplant. These patients do not receive a BMT today primarily because they are unfit with active disease and are not considered eligible, as they cannot tolerate the rigors of therapy required to induce a remission and the conditioning agents required to ablate the marrow prior to a BMT.



Beyond BMT, the opportunity exists for better conditioning in other areas of cellular therapy such as CAR-T as well as gene therapies. The pipeline of CAR-T and gene therapies has rapidly expanded, with the addressable patient population expected to nearly double in the next one to five years and reach approximately 93,000 patients in the U.S. by 2030 based on the current pipeline. The CAR-T market size in terms of dollars is estimated to grow at a CAGR of approximately 11% over the next 5 plus years. The addressable market for Iomab-ACT is in line with the patient population for cellular therapy as all patients receive conditioning of some type prior to these treatments. We will continue to develop Iomab-ACT, our lower dose, next generation conditioning program for rapidly growing cell and gene therapies based on early promising results, ultimately with the value proposition of improving overall access and outcomes for patients who need cellular or gene therapies.



Our Strategy



Actinium’s strategy is to build a fully-integrated, specialty radiotherapeutics company focused on the top 100 cancer hospitals using the power of our platform to deliver new treatment options for patient populations living with high unmet medical needs in hematology and oncology. We believe our focus on relapsed and refractory disease in cancer indications with high unmet medical need, with limited or no competition, and where the primary delivery of care occurs in a few large comprehensive cancer care centers, is the appropriate strategy for our company. The cell killing power of linear energy transfer delivered via radiotherapeutics is unmatched by other technologies and we believe relapsed, refractory disease is an area where radiotherapeutics can succeed over other approaches. However, radiotherapeutics must be delivered on a just-in-time basis, and commercial and supply chain barriers are higher than with other types of medicines. The validity of our approach is demonstrated by our product development strategy as well as the commercial and operating model that we are building for our lead product candidates, Iomab-B and Actimab-A.

We intend to transform the treatment of AML with our Iomab-B and Actimab-A product candidates, each of which has demonstrated impressive extension of survival in the most difficult-to-treat patients who are typically expected to survive two to four months. The r/r AML segment comprises over 50% of all AML patients. Actimab-A, a therapeutic agent, and Iomab-B for induction and conditioning, can be used in a complementary fashion as depicted in the diagram below. Based on solid clinical evidence with these product candidates, we intend to develop and commercialize these two radiotherapy drugs, starting with Iomab-B in 2024 and Actimab-A in 2027, if approved, to improve survival in patients with r/r AML.



Iomab-B and Actimab-A have the potential to significantly improve r/r AML outcomes in a complementary manner






The operating model required to achieve our vision is attractive for several reasons, including the concentrated point of care; the top 50 transplant centers account for approximately 75% of BMTs and the top 100 hospitals treat over 50 percent of r/r AML patients. Further, there is significant overlap in the healthcare providers and ecosystem required to diagnose, treat and care for r/r AML patients within these hospitals, which will enable us to deploy a relatively small commercial organization and operate a supply chain without the need for large investments. Our product pipeline is targeting a broader opportunity in conditioning via label expansion of Iomab-B into BMT for other blood cancers and with Iomab-ACT, our next generation conditioning program for rapidly growing cell and gene therapies. Further, our solid tumor programs are initially directed at relapsed or refractory cancers, a stage of disease where treatment is again concentrated in large hospitals, which account for a significant portion of patients. We believe our strategy will enable us to build a successful company with high operating efficiencies and is feasible to achieve without requiring a commercial partner.



Our strategic priorities are to:




● | Establish Iomab-B as the standard of care to improve BMT access and survival outcomes in r/r AML patients who are currently not considered transplantable in routine clinical practice: We intend to file a BLA in the second half of 2023 based on the strong results from the Pivotal Phase 3 SIERRA trial and leverage our proven operating track record at key cancer centers to build a high impact organization that can effectively commercialize Iomab-B. By virtue of the SIERRA trial, we have established operations at 24 leading BMT centers that represent about 30% of transplant volume in the U.S. and have strong working partnership with Key Opinion Leaders and their teams. The positive SIERRA results demonstrating unprecedented access to BMT and outcomes along with our commitment to operational excellence provides a strong foundation for our commercial team in the U.S. We will also work with our partner Immedica to file the MAA for the EU and support Iomab-B’s potential approval and launch with our expertise, as well as supply drug product for commercialization.

● | Advance Actimab-A in combinations as a backbone therapy for r/r AML: We intend to progress late-stage development of Actimab-A to leverage its mutation-agnostic mechanism of action and exploit synergies by combining with other treatments to develop it as an AML backbone therapy. This approach is validated by proof-of-concept data from our Actimab-A + CLAG-M combination trial in r/r AML, which included 57% of patients who had failed venetoclax and live two to four months on average. The results demonstrated high response rates overall and in these venetoclax failed patients median overall survival was 59% at one year and thirty-two percent at two years. Our collaboration with the NCI under the CRADA will provide broad support for late-stage development of Actimab-A + CLAG-M and also other clinical trials to broaden use while preserving our balance sheet. Actimab-A, if approved, would enable us to launch a second product that is complementary to Iomab-B and fulfill our ambition of radically transforming the treatment outcomes of r/r AML and expand our commercial footprint into the remaining top 100 cancer care centers outside of the leading BMT hospitals.

● | Expand the Iomab-B label and revenue stream via life cycle management: We intend to leverage data from several clinical trials that demonstrate the ability of Iomab-B to improve BMT access and outcomes in five additional hematologic indications. These data in MDS, ALL, HL, NHL and MM provide the foundation to expand the label for Iomab-B and increase its market potential. In AML, we would seek label expansion into haploidentical transplants, earlier lines of treatment and younger patients below the age of 55, the cutoff in the SIERRA trial. As much as possible, we would seek to use investigator sponsored trials as the primary strategy for label expansion in order to maximize capital utilization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further expand our conditioning franchise by developing Iomab-ACT for cell and gene therapies: We plan to develop Iomab-ACT to be used for either lymphodepletion or reduced intensity conditioning prior to CAR-T and gene therapies. Similar to BMT, access and outcomes of patients who might benefit from these therapies is limited by sub-optimal chemotherapy-based conditioning agents. The number of patients potentially eligible for Iomab-ACT is growing with increased availability of commercial cell and gene therapy products, as well as the expanding number of indications. We are studying Iomab-ACT in conditioning prior to CAR-T cellular therapy via a National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) funded clinical trial with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (“MSKCC”). We expect to present proof-of-concept data from this study in the second half of 2023 and announce further development of this program in the CAR-T space.

● | Leverage our R&D capabilities and technological prowess to advance our solid tumor programs and partnerships: We intend to continue to direct our R&D effort to advance our solid tumor programs into the clinic and support life cycle management for Iomab-B and Actimab-A. Our solid tumor programs and technological capabilities are validated by our partnerships with Astellas, LG Chem, and EpicentRx, which are focused on solid tumors and immunotherapies. Our R&D prowess is demonstrated by our robust patent portfolio with over 200 issued and pending patent applications worldwide which include protection for Iomab-B into 2037. Our IP portfolio also includes several patent families to manufacture Ac-225 in a cyclotron, and valuable know-how.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In keeping with our strategic vision over the next five years, we would first focus our energies on ensuring an Iomab-B approval and successful launch into core BMT centers to ensure commercial success. We intend to expand the Iomab-B label and revenue stream in a capital efficient manner while progressing the development of Actimab-A by leveraging the NCI CRADA and its balance sheet sparing opportunity. We will progress the development of Iomab-ACT to proof-of-concept and explore partnerships as a means to achieve commercialization. Our solid tumor programs will progress toward the clinic as we continue to build out our commercial footprint into the top 100 hospitals leaving us well-positioned to develop them in accordance with our vision. With commercial dynamics aligning favorably for a successful Iomab-B launch and with late-stage development of Actimab-A in collaboration with the NCI, we plan to deliver on our mission to transform the treatment of AML and patient outcomes, and create a highly differentiated, specialty radiotherapeutics company focused on the top 100 large hospitals.

Our Product Pipeline



We have strategically focused our development efforts in areas where there is a significant unmet medical need. We are developing a portfolio of novel radiotherapeutics that has the potential to positively impact the outcomes of people living with hard-to-treat diseases such as r/r AML via both a therapeutic and induction/conditioning agent. Outside of AML, our pipeline development offers the opportunity to enhance the value proposition of cell and gene therapies with our targeted conditioning programs.






AML Focused Programs – Iomab-B and Actimab-A



Our Iomab-B and Actimab-A product candidates are focused on addressing the major unmet medical needs in r/r AML in a complementary manner and are directed at different parts of the patient journey.



Iomab-B – Targeted Radiotherapeutic for Induction and Conditioning. A potential new standard of care enabling a curative BMT in currently non-transplantable r/r AML patients with poor survival prognosis



Opportunity to Change the Current Paradigm for Accessing a BMT and Improving Outcomes 



The current approach in preparing patients for a BMT is to first induce a remission with therapeutic agents to reduce the disease burden and then suppress or destroy the patient’s immune system, including the diseased bone marrow, with conditioning regimens prior to transplanting the healthy donor hematopoietic stem cells, which are expected to restore normal bone marrow function following engraftment. As this approach requires patients to withstand multiple challenges from non-targeted therapies, which include chemotherapy agents and/or total body irradiation that are highly toxic, BMT is typically limited to FIT patients. Iomab-B is a targeted therapy that provides both disease control and conditioning in one agent and is well-tolerated even by UNFIT patients who typically are not transplanted in routine practice today. The SIERRA trial was designed to demonstrate that UNFIT patients with active disease could be administered Iomab-B and proceed directly to a BMT without the need for inducing a remission and that this approach could result in improved survival and curative outcomes. As seen by the positive results of the SIERRA trial detailed below, Iomab-B represents an exciting new paradigm in the management of AML patients and establishes a potential new standard of care especially for UNFIT patients in the relapsed or refractory setting.



A similar approach has also been tried in the Phase 3 ASAP trial but with FIT patients. However, to avoid confusion between the potential of the approaches used in the ASAP and SIERRA trials, important distinctions between these trials are depicted in the graphic below. The ASAP trial sought to demonstrate non-inferiority between two non-novel approaches and found that outcomes similar to those of current practice could be achieved without first getting a patient into remission before taking them to BMT by giving them sequential conditioning or treating them twice with non-targeted chemotherapy agents that are typically used in this setting.



The ASAP approach is limited to only FIT patients as the UNFIT patients treated in SIERRA could not tolerate ASAP’s highly toxic sequential conditioning approach. Sequential conditioning is not novel as a similar trial to ASAP was conducted by the UK National Cancer Research Institute in 2019, which did not show any benefit from this approach in high-risk AML and MDS patients (Craddock et al. Augmented Reduced Intensity Regimen Does Not Improve Postallogeneic Transplant Outcomes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. J Clin Oncol. 2021). The SIERRA trial results therefore can change the paradigm in transplant because non-transplantable patients in routine clinical practice can benefit from a transplant with Iomab-B and have superior outcomes. While both approaches in these trials support increased access to BMT, only Iomab-B is applicable to the unfit patients who comprise approximately 80%of r/r AML patients and can potentially expand the market for transplant.

Schetelig et al. Results from the Randomized Phase III ASAP Trial. ASH 2022



Pivotal Phase 3 SIERRA Trial for Iomab-B (131Iodine-apamistamab) 



The SIERRA trial was designed to demonstrate the ability of Iomab-B to overcome challenges related to patient access to curative BMT. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of patients with AML have primary refractory disease while 50% relapse quickly after achieving initial remission. Getting these patients with primary r/r AML into remission is very challenging due to characteristics such as age, comorbidities, and disease features such as high-risk mutations that contribute to lack of response to salvage therapies and limit treatment options.



Patients must be able to overcome several challenges related to curative BMT. The first access challenge is that the patient needs to be in complete remission prior to BMT. The current clinical practice is not to transplant patients with active AML as outcomes are poor due to high relapse rates. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) guidelines also recommend treatment to achieve remission prior to transplant in patients with relapsed AML. The second challenge to access is tolerance to current conditioning regimens. For older patients, myeloablative regimens are not an option due to intense toxicity and mortality. The third challenge is the ability to achieve post-BMT remission and successful engraftment. Inadequate conditioning can lead to graft failure, which is associated with very high mortality. Patients who fail to achieve a CR post-transplant have extremely poor outcomes and a survival of a few weeks. The fourth challenge relates to BMT tolerability and post-BMT complications. The conditioning and immunosuppressive regimens given to these patients put them at high risk for infectious complications and toxicity. In the SIERRA trial, Iomab-B addresses all four of these challenges. Access to BMT is improved as CR is not needed pre-BMT given effective disease control and targeted myeloablation. With better post-BMT engraftment, CR and lower complications, the SIERRA trial also addressed the challenges related to improved outcomes through Iomab-B.

The SIERRA results, presented in the late-breaker session at the 2023 Tandem Meetings: Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Meetings of the ASTCT and the CIBMTR, support Iomab-B’s value proposition of enabling both improved access and outcomes of a BMT, thereby providing a significant curative option for r/r patients, a segment that represents approximately 50% of all AML patients and the majority not transplanted today. The design of the SIERRA trial is provided in the figure below.



SIERRA: A Novel, Pivotal Phase 3 Study of Iomab-B in r/r AML







The pivotal Phase 3 SIERRA trial is a 153-patient, randomized, multi-center, controlled trial of Iomab-B in patients aged 55 and above with active r/r AML, who were heavily pre-treated and had high-risk characteristics. Patients enrolled had blast counts of 5% or greater in the marrow or circulating blasts suggestive of active AML. In this study, Iomab-B was compared to the control arm that allowed physician’s choice of over 20 available agents, including chemotherapies and/or targeted therapies such as venetoclax (BCL-2 inhibitor), FLT3 inhibitors, IDH inhibitors and Mylotarg, reflecting current best treatment practices attempting to get patients to CR. The control arm included recently approved AML therapies that were added to the SIERRA protocol as they became available. The crossover arm was designed in SIERRA for an equipoise that offered Iomab-B to patients failing to achieve a CR on the control arm with an intent to rescue them by taking them to transplant. Of note, SIERRA had highly restrictive optionality for post-transplant maintenance. Patients with active, r/r AML are not considered eligible for BMT with current approaches and the SIERRA trial was the only randomized Phase 3 trial to offer BMT as a treatment option for this patient population. These patients would not be offered BMT in standard practice and therefore have dismal survival outcomes of two to three months. The primary endpoint of the SIERRA trial was dCR of 180 days and the secondary endpoints are OS and Event-Free Survival (“EFS”). The comparison of OS in subjects randomized to the control arm who crossed over to receive Iomab-B versus all others in the control group was an exploratory efficacy endpoint.





8







As seen in the graphic below, the primary endpoint of 6-month dCR was met with a high degree of statistical significance (p<0.0001). 75% of patients (44/59) receiving Iomab-B achieved an initial remission 30 days after their BMT compared to 6.3% of patients (4/64) in the control arm. 22% of the patients receiving Iomab-B maintained dCR lasting 180 days or more despite limited optionality for post-transplant maintenance, while none of the patients on the control arm achieved dCR. The current standard practice is to administer post-transplant maintenance therapy to reduce chances of relapse. The results presented below are on a per protocol basis, which means that only data that was in strict adherence to the protocol without any deviations was considered for the analysis. It is important to note that the p-value of the primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat analysis was <0.0001, the same as the per protocol analysis.



SIERRA Results: Iomab-B Meets Primary Endpoint with High Significance (p<0.0001)






As demonstrated in the OS graph below, patients who achieved 6-month dCR had 92.3% 1-year survival and 59.9% 2-year survival. Median OS had not been reached in these patients. It is worth noting that two years in CR is a significant milestone in this patient population, highly indicative of long-term survival and a possible curative outcome.

Overall Survival for Patients who Achieved 6-month dCR with Iomab-B






OS was one of the secondary endpoints of the study. The Kaplan-Meier plot in the inset of the graph below shows Intent-to-Treat (“ITT”) OS results between the Iomab-B arm and the control arm. Due to the crossover design, ITT analysis of OS was confounded by the early crossover of patients (within 28 days) from the control arm to the Iomab-B arm (57.1%). The effective rescue of these crossover patients by Iomab-B led to an outsized contribution of the Iomab-B effect on control arm patients. As a result, median OS in the Iomab-B arm was similar to that in the control arm and this secondary endpoint was not met in the ITT analysis.



In order to isolate the true impact of Iomab-B on OS, one of the exploratory efficacy endpoints was the comparison of OS in subjects randomized to the control arm who crossed over to receive Iomab-B versus all others in the control arm, as well as the control arm patients who did not crossover versus the Iomab-B arm. The Kaplan-Meier plot of OS in the graphic below shows that this exploratory analysis demonstrated the clear benefit of Iomab-B over the control arm. The median OS for the Iomab-B group was 6.4 months which was double the 3.2 months for the non-crossover patients in the control arm. Patients who crossed over from the control arm to receive Iomab-B had a median OS of 7.1 months demonstrating further the ability of Iomab-B to treat patients who are non-treatable by conventional means.



A similar pattern favoring the Iomab-B group was seen across the pre-defined subgroups, where 1-year OS for Iomab-B was 26.1% compared with 13.1% for the non-crossover control arm. The 1-year OS for patients in the crossover arm was 35.8%. This clearly demonstrates the OS benefit of Iomab-B over the control arm and two to three-fold improvement in survival outcomes possible with its use.

Kaplan-Meier Plot of Overall Survival ‒ Iomab-B, Crossover, and Non-Crossover Control Arm 






Iomab-B produced a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the secondary endpoint of EFS, with a 78% reduction in the probability of an event (Hazard Ratio=0.22, p<0.0001 for both per protocol and ITT basis). EFS at 180 days for the Iomab-B arm was 28% compared to 0.2% for the control arm. In the SIERRA trial, an event is defined as one of the following: a patient not achieving CR/CRp or crossing over, patient not receiving BMT, a patient relapsing or death.



In the figure below comparing EFS with Iomab-B versus the control arm, the initial vertical drop in the curve in the Iomab-B arm represents those patients who did not achieve a remission after Iomab-B or those who did not proceed to transplant, while the initial vertical drop in the curve in the control arm mainly represents patients who did not achieve a remission with salvage therapy and either crossed over to Iomab-B or went onto best supportive care.



Event-Free Survival with Iomab-B Versus Control Arm






The table below shows relevant adverse events in transplanted Iomab-B patients. In these patients, incidence of sepsis was four times lower in the Iomab-B arm than the control arm (6.1% vs. 28.6%). In addition, rates of other treatment related adverse events were lower in favor of Iomab-B, including febrile neutropenia (43.9% vs. 50.0%), mucositis (15.2% vs. 21.4%) and acute graft versus host disease (“GVHD”) (26.1% vs. 35.7%).

Grade ≥3 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Transplanted Patients Through Day 100 Post-HCT






With current treatment practice, patients who have r/r AML with active disease, utilizing current conditioning agents have poor outcomes and very low survival rates. Using an Iomab-B led regimen, an unprecedented number of patients were able to access transplant and were able to do so with active disease, eliminating need for achieving a CR in order to transplant the patient. Thus, patients are also able to access BMT faster with Iomab-B, in less than half the time compared to conventional care. Iomab-B represents an exciting new paradigm with the potential to establish a new standard of care in r/r AML setting, making it possible for most patients to get to a successful transplant with Iomab-B with a portion of these patients having a long-term survival benefit. As shown below, with an Iomab-B led regimen, the majority of patients who are non-transplantable in routine clinical practice can be successfully transplanted, administering myeloablative radiation with reduced intensity conditioning tolerability to ultimately achieve transformative survival outcome, changing the treatment paradigm for r/r AML patients.



Iomab-B – New Paradigm to Upend BMT Access and Improve r/r AML Outcomes






Future Development and Life Cycle Management for Iomab-B



The results of the Pivotal Phase 3 SIERRA trial validate the value proposition of Iomab-B, and we believe it could establish unprecedented access to transplant (currently the only curative option) with better safety and tolerability and improved outcomes, all of which could potentially make Iomab-B the new standard of care for patients with r/r AML. We are actively working to launch an EAP and successfully file a BLA in the second half of 2023, and if approved, we anticipate the commercial launch for Iomab-B in 2024.

We intend to commercialize Iomab-B in the U.S. The commercial opportunity is supported by favorable dynamics, summarized by the “Three Ps and Two Cs”:




● | Patients: With its promising profile, Iomab-B provides the opportunity for unprecedented BMT access and better outcomes for patients, with favorable safety and tolerability
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Physicians: Our goal is to help physicians make BMT an option for a vast majority of r/r AML patients who currently are unable to access transplant without disruption to current practice. Patients are able to return to their referring physicians for post-BMT follow-up, long-term care
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payers: Iomab-B potentially unlocks value through getting patients safely to effective, potentially curative transplants, with improved outcomes and a manageable safety and tolerability profile
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competition: While there have been multiple new product approvals in AML over the last several years, they primarily focus on addressing genetic mutations, with limited competition in conditioning to increase access to BMT. We do not see direct or indirect visible competition for Iomab-B in the 5-to-10-year horizon to impair the commercial success of Iomab-B
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Concentrated Call Points: The commercialization for Iomab-B will benefit from a concentrated market. The top 50 centers perform 75% of BMTs and tend to be concentrated in metropolitan areas. These factors allow for commercialization delivered by a focused 35–50-person commercial organization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The favorable commercial dynamics for Iomab-B in the U.S. are further supported by the strong foundation of core competencies developed during the successful execution of the SIERRA trial at leading high-volume BMT centers. We established and actively managed end-to-end supply chain, never missing a patient dose, and were able to treat 60% more patients than expected due to the high number of crossover patients. We focused on operational excellence at the point of care, working in partnership with leading Key Opinion Leaders and their teams to successfully execute SIERRA at a wide array of centers. As a result, we have broad reach across leading BMT centers that account for 30% of BMT volume, which speaks to the concentration of the BMT market. The positive SIERRA results of unprecedented access and outcomes along with our commitment to operational excellence provide a strong foundation for our commercial team.



In April 2022, Actinium licensed the EUMENA commercial rights for Iomab-B to Immedica, an independent pharmaceutical company headquartered in Sweden. Immedica has significant know-how and experience in commercializing niche and specialty care products across Europe and the Middle East, with extensive regulatory and commercial expertise and capabilities. Actinium will continue to be responsible for certain clinical development activities and Iomab-B manufacturing and will retain commercialization rights in the U.S. and rest of the world. Currently, there an estimated ~7,200 BMTs for AML in EUMENA, two times that of the U.S., performed in a concentrated of number of centers. The incidence rate of AML in Europe is 3.7 per 100,000, or ~27,500 new patients per year. Actinium received an upfront payment of $35 million USD with the potential for an additional $417 million USD in regulatory and sales milestones and mid-twenty percent royalties. Iomab-B has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the EMA and has received positive Scientific Advice from EMA that the SIERRA trial can support a marketing authorization with filing expected in 2024.

Background on Iomab-B 



Iomab-B is a first in class targeted radiotherapy consisting of apamistamab, an anti-CD45 mouse antibody conjugated to radioactive iodine 131 (“I-131”) designed to deliver targeted myeloablative radiation to malignant and hematopoietic cells prior to allogeneic BMT. CD45 is uniquely expressed on blood cancer, immune and bone marrow stem cells at high levels. Targeting CD45 enables delivery of high radiation doses directly to the bone marrow, with a median of 16 gray and as high as 44.6 gray in the SIERRA trial, while minimizing radiation exposure to vital organs such as lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract, thereby producing myeloablative outcomes with an overall better safety profile and the tolerability of a reduced intensity regimen. I-131 is a beta- and gamma-emitting radioisotope that works on the cell surface and does not need to be internalized. Developed at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (“FHCRC”), Iomab-B has been studied in multiple disease indications including leukemias, lymphomas, MDS, and MM. Over 300 patients received Iomab-B through prior studies, demonstrating the potential for unprecedented access to BMT, improved survival and tolerability, and we intend to leverage these data as we plan for label expansion of Iomab-B. Iomab-B has been granted Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and has patent protection into 2037.



Actimab-A – CD33 targeting radiotherapeutic – mutation agnostic mechanism of action has potential as combination backbone therapy in highly radiosensitive, mutation rich AML



Our Actimab-A (225Ac-lintuzumab satetraxetan) program is focused on developing combinations with other AML treatment regimens with mechanistic synergies to establish Actimab-A as a backbone therapy, leveraging the mutation-agnostic mechanism of action of Actimab-A. There is no known resistance mechanism to targeted radiotherapies, making Actimab-A an attractive candidate for a variety of combinations. The scientific rational is to use CLAG-M, a powerful chemotherapy regimen routinely used to treat patients with r/r AML, and then use Actimab-A for its precision targeting ability that produces double-strand-DNA breaks that lead to cancer cell death to clear out residual disease. Actimab-A has demonstrated clinically significant survival benefit in a proof-of-concept study and is poised for advanced development in collaboration with the NCI.



Actimab-A + CLAG-M Phase 1 Study Results 



In collaboration with the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Actimab-A + CLAG-M Phase 1 trial was conducted in r/r AML patients. These patients had a median age of 63, failed two or more lines of therapy, which includes 57% having received prior treatment with venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor. 67% of these patients had adverse cytogenetics, 52% had a TP53 mutation, and 57% had a prior BMT. Median OS is typically two to four months for this patient population, with a median OS of less than 3 months for patients who relapsed following venetoclax and a median OS less than 2 months for those with a TP53 mutation.



These trial results were presented as an oral presentation at the ASH Annual Meeting on December 10, 2022. In this difficult-to-treat r/r AML population, the results demonstrate its high potential. We reported 1-year survival of 53% and 2-year survival of 32%, which are as much as double what can be expected with currently available therapies. The trial showed an Overall Response Rate (“ORR”) of 65% across all dose cohorts, 52% complete remission rate, and a 75% MRD negativity rate. As highlighted in the figure below, the results are highly encouraging and show that the high rates of responses and MRD negativity are translating to a meaningful survival benefit in these difficult-to-treat patients, who would otherwise have dismal outcomes.



Actimab-A + CLAG-M – Impressive Response and Survival Benefit in r/r AML









14







Actimab-A + CLAG-M Compared to CLAG-M Alone in r/r AML



Efficacy of CLAG-M has been reported in older studies (Halpern and Walter. CLAG-M with dose-escalated mitoxantrone for adults with acute myeloid leukemia. Oncotarget 2018 and Mushtaq et al. Comparison of Salvage Chemotherapy Regimens in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia. ASH 2018) in patients with r/r AML, however, almost all of these studies were conducted in the pre-targeted therapy era where no patients enrolled had prior venetoclax-based therapy, thus efficacy data of CLAG-M in the current era, in patients exposed to prior venetoclax, or with other high-risk features, is limited. When combined with Actimab-A, the combination has demonstrated a clinically significant survival benefit in a proof-of-concept study irrespective of prior targeted treatment. Relapsed or refractory AML after failing venetoclax-based therapy is associated with dismal survival outcomes, with a median OS of less than 3 months. In comparison, the combination trial of Actimab-A + CLAG-M led to 1-year survival of 59% and 2-year survival of 32% in patients who failed prior venetoclax-based therapy, which compares very favorably to the traditional outcomes in these patients.



Actimab-A + venetoclax Phase 1/2 Study Results



We are conducting a Phase 1/2 multi-center trial combining Actimab-A + venetoclax in both fit and unfit patients 18 years and older with r/r AML led by UCLA Medical Center. On December 10, 2022, data from our Actimab-A + venetoclax combination trial was presented at the ASH Annual Meeting. We have demonstrated preclinically that combinations of Actimab-A and venetoclax have mechanistic synergies. Overexpression of MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, is associated with resistance to venetoclax in AML. Actimab-A kills tumors cells with DNA double-strand breaks and downregulates MCL-1, which can (re-)sensitize AML cells or reduce tumor resistance to venetoclax. The Actimab-A + venetoclax combination has been well-tolerated with responses, including a CR and a partial response in early dose escalation cohorts. In our ongoing clinical trial, we are exploring the optimal dose of Actimab-A, as well as the dosing regimen of the combination. We expect to present proof-of-concept of this study in the second half of 2023.



Advanced Development and Planning for Actimab-A



On February 6, 2023, we announced that we entered into a CRADA with the NCI, part of the NIH, to develop Actimab-A for the treatment of patients with AML and other hematologic malignancies. The NCI will serve as the regulatory sponsor for any clinical trials mutually approved by both parties to study Actimab-A, and the CRADA will provide extensive support for and accelerate the development of Actimab-A alone or in combination with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted agents and other novel combinations. The CRADA studies will be overseen by the NCI in collaboration with Actinium’s clinical development team, where Actinium has the right to review and approval all protocols and has full right to all data. This broad collaboration may accelerate our Actimab-A development efforts with access to NCI’s vast network of over 2,000 clinical trial sites and its Myelomatch program. Later this year, we will provide updates on our progress as we move into late-stage development with Actimab-A + CLAG-M, as well as other developments with our venetoclax combination trial as part of our backbone development strategy.



Background on Actimab-A



Actimab-A is an anti-CD33 antibody linked to the potent alpha-emitting radioisotope Ac-225. Actimab-A targets CD33, which is expressed in virtually all malignant cells in patients with AML regardless of cytogenetics or mutations and enables potent alpha radiation to be directed against radiosensitive AML cells. These cells have no known resistance or repair mechanisms when hit with the alpha particles from the Ac-225 isotope payload that cause double stranded DNA breaks. We believe Actimab-A is the first radiotherapeutic for r/r AML and has the unique value proposition of broad applicability, a differentiated mechanism of action, and targeted precision that is well-tolerated with minimal toxicity. Our CD33 development program is driven by data obtained from approximately 150 AML patients in 6 trials and demonstrated single agent activity with high response rates, but was also associated with prolonged neutropenia. A combination strategy was considered appropriate given the changing treatment landscape of AML; hence, based on presumed mechanistic synergies, an investigator initiated trial of Actimab-A + CLAG-M and a company-sponsored Actimab-A + venetoclax were developed and patients were enrolled into these studies.

Conditioning Focused Programs



Iomab-B



We will further expand the Iomab-B franchise by focusing on lifecycle management for label enhancement and indication expansion. Iomab-B data in five additional hematologic indications (i.e., MDS, ALL, HL, NHL, and MM) provide the foundation to explore indication expansion opportunities to increase the total addressable market for Iomab-B. Across early trials at the FHCRC, Iomab-B demonstrated similar improved access to BMT and outcomes. We will leverage these data with strong results from the pivotal Phase 3 SIERRA trial to execute a comprehensive life cycle management strategy to further expand Iomab-B’s role in a variety of malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders, We will continue to develop the Iomab-B franchise to potentially address a broader market opportunity to address the over 165,000 patients diagnosed with cancers (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma), who could potentially benefit from transplant, but are unable to access one today.



Iomab-ACT



Iomab-ACT is comprised of apamistamab, the same anti-CD45 antibody as Iomab-B, but utilizes lower, nonmyeloablative levels of I-131 to achieve lymphodepletion for cellular therapies such as CAR-T or reduced intensity conditioning for gene therapies. We intend to continue to develop the Iomab-ACT program designed specifically for use prior to CAR-T and gene therapies, ultimately with a value proposition of improving overall access and outcomes for patients who need cellular or gene therapies.



Preclinical data showed a single, low-dose of Iomab-ACT demonstrated lymphodepletion and as CD45 positive immune cells are implicated in major CAR-T side effects, i.e., cytokine release syndrome ("CRS") and immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (“ICANS"), Iomab-ACT has the potential to be developed as a conditioning agent for CAR-T therapies. CRS and ICANS remain two most common toxicities of CAR-T therapies with severe cases (>Grade 3) seen in >20% of patients and fatality rates between 0-10%. Due to its effect on host monocytes/macrophages, we believe conditioning with Iomab-ACT will potentially reduce the incidence of CRS and ICANS.



Unlike chemotherapy, Iomab-ACT is targeted in nature, and we expect it to potentially promote improved CAR-T cell expansion, resulting in responses that are higher and more durable. We believe our Iomab-ACT program is highly differentiated when compared to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (“Flu/Cy”) or other chemotherapy-based regimens that are used as standard practice today for lymphodepletion prior to cell therapy.



We are studying Iomab-ACT in collaboration with MSKCC, for conditioning prior to CAR-T therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“B-ALL”) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”). This study funded by a NIH grant is the first-of-its-kind study to use a radiotherapeutic-based conditioning regimen with CAR-T therapy. We have completed treatment of an initial cohort of three patients and will expand to a second cohort. This study was presented at the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2022 as a trial-in-progress. We expect to present proof-of-concept data from this study in 2023 and look forward to sharing more on our Iomab-ACT trial with MSKCC, along with future development plans in the CAR-T space.



R&D and Preclinical Programs



Our R&D efforts yield differentiated, high-value programs that demonstrate our experience across multiple validated cancer targets and isotopes and cover broad areas of focus leveraging our clinical development experience across hematology, targeted conditioning, solid tumors, and next generation radiotherapies. Our programs also inform the advancement of our Iomab-B, Actimab-A, and Iomab-ACT programs. Our research collaborations with Astellas, LG Chem, formerly AVEO Oncology, and EpicentRx establish our work with immunotherapies and in solid tumors. We are working on several preclinical programs which include novel approaches to established targets such as HER2 and HER3, as well as novel targets that show immense potential for radiotherapeutic approaches. Underpinning our development programs is our expanded patent portfolio of over 200 issued patents and pending patent applications worldwide.





16







We have utilized our technology platform to develop our clinical portfolio in hematology – Iomab-B and Actimab-A, in conditioning for transplant and as a therapeutic, respectively. In addition, our robust platform been used to develop a pipeline of novel radiotherapeutic assets to drive company growth. Preclinical pharmacology studies with our targeted radiotherapeutics such as HER3-ARC, HER2-ARC or CD33-ARC have shown dramatic improvement in tumor growth inhibition in various preclinical tumor models as single agents or in combination with immunotherapy such as magrolimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody. These results have prompted the team to spearhead efforts in multiple solid tumor programs.



Actinium’s lead solid tumor program is a targeted radiotherapy against HER3, a pan-cancer target that is overexpressed in several solid tumor indications with high unmet need. In April 2022, we presented the first HER3-targeted radiotherapeutic agent at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting showing potent tumor cell cytotoxicity, enhanced antitumor effects and significantly improved survival with an Ac-225 radiolabeled HER3 antibody compared to a naked HER3 antibody in a preclinical non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) model. We have also demonstrated the direct impact of targeted radiotherapy in modulating immune signals such as calreticulin upregulation to enhance tumor cell killing. Further, we have leveraged the immunomodulatory effect(s) of targeted radiotherapy in combination with CD47 targeting agents such as magrolimab for sustained tumor growth inhibition in mouse models of AML and NSCLC. These results were presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (“SITC”) Annual Meeting held in 2021.



Our R&D team continues to expand on capabilities and technologies across therapeutic modalities, linker technologies and in vivo cancer models, and build significant visibility through presentations at key conferences and publications in journals of high impact. Our R&D efforts are centered on the advancement of our key programs with a robust “fast-to-clinic” approach in niche indications and are backed by an extensive IP estate that comprises over 200 patents and patent applications including the methods of Ac-225 production.



Our Platform Technology



Our proprietary technology platform is built on the core competency to produce targeted radiotherapeutics, and coupled with our know-how and IP, establishes our company in the development of isotope-agnostic, multi-targeted products that may address the treatment of hard-to-treat diseases. In our clinical and preclinical programs, we have utilized multiple isotopes including Ac-225, I-131 and Lutetium-177 directed at multiple targets in oncology and hematology such as CD45, CD33, HER3, among others. Our targeted radiotherapies combine the cell-killing ability of radiation via a radioisotope payload with a targeting agent, such as a monoclonal antibody.



In addition to developing targeted radiotherapies, we also own patents related to the manufacturing of Ac-225 in a cyclotron. We have expertise in utilizing the alpha emitting isotope Ac-225 including clinical experience in treating approximately 150 patients with our alpha-emitter-based therapies, “gold standard” linker technology and five issued patents in the U.S. and 49 patents internationally related to the manufacturing or Ac-225 in a cyclotron, which we believe has the potential to produce higher quantities of highly pure Ac-225 than current methods. When appropriate, we are well-positioned to leverage this technology to produce Ac-225.



Intellectual Property



Our proprietary technology platform is supported by IP, know-how and trade secrets that cover the generation, development, methods of use and manufacture of targeted radiotherapies and their select components. Our IP covers various methods of use in multiple diseases, including indication, dose and scheduling, radionuclide warhead, and therapeutic combinations.



As of March 2023, we have expanded our patent portfolio to over 200 issued patents and pending patent applications worldwide, which we believe constitutes a valuable business asset. Our IP includes 45 patent families, including key patents that relate primarily to our radiotherapeutic candidates. Our patent portfolio includes 12 issued patents and 39 pending patent applications in the U.S., and 151 that are issued or pending internationally. The effective lives of the issued patents in our portfolio, or patents that may issue from the pending applications in our portfolio, ranges from expirations between 2024 and 2043.



For our Iomab-B product candidate, we have four issued patents in the U.S. and issued patents in Canada, Europe and Japan that relate to the composition. The basic patent terms of these patents expire in 2036 and 2037. Related patent applications are also currently pending in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we own both U.S. and international pending patent applications that relate to the use of Iomab-B or Iomab-ACT in the treatment of cancers and non-malignant conditions.





17







Our patents also cover key areas of our business such as manufacturing key components of our product candidate, Actimab-A, including Ac-225 in a cyclotron. We have expertise in utilizing the alpha emitting isotope Ac-225 including clinical experience in treating approximately 150 patients with our alpha-emitter-based therapies, “gold standard” linker technology and five issued patents in the U.S. and 49 patents internationally related to the manufacturing or Ac-225 in a cyclotron, which we believe has the potential to produce higher quantities of Ac-225 than currently utilized methods. These patents will expire in the years 2024 through 2027. In addition, we also own U.S. and international patents and pending patent applications that relate to the manufacturing of Actimab-A and its use in the treatment of cancers.



Strategic Collaborations and Licensing Agreements



Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center




On June 15, 2012, the Company entered into a license and sponsored research agreement with FHCRC to build upon previous and ongoing clinical trials with Iomab-B. Developed at the FHCRC, a pioneer in the field of BMT, Iomab-B has been studied in over 400 patients and is supported by data in six disease indications including leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma. The Company has been granted exclusive rights to the antibody and related master cell bank developed by FHCRC. A milestone payment of $1 million will be due to FHCRC upon FDA approval of the first drug utilizing the licensed antibody. Upon commercial sale of the drug, royalty payments of 2% of net sales will be due to FHCRC.




Immedica AB



In April 2022, Actinium licensed the EUMENA commercial rights for Iomab-B to Immedica, an independent pharmaceutical company headquartered in Sweden. Immedica has significant know-how and experience in commercializing niche and specialty care products across Europe and the Middle East, with extensive expertise and capabilities across sales and marketing, market access, regulatory and medical affairs, drug safety and quality assurance, among others. Actinium received an upfront payment of $35 million USD with the potential for an additional $417 million USD in regulatory and sales milestones and mid-twenty percent royalties. The market potential is extremely compelling in the EU with approximately 50% larger with 15,000 patients with r/r AML and double the number of BMTs performed than in the US. Iomab-B has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the EMA and has received positive Scientific Advice from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA.



National Cancer Institute



In February 2023, we announced that Actinium entered into a CRADA with the NCI, part of the NIH, to develop Actimab-A in for the treatment of patients with AML and other hematologic malignancies. Under the terms of the CRADA, the NCI will serve as the regulatory sponsor for any clinical trials mutually approved by both parties to study Actimab-A while Actinium will be responsible for supplying and distributing Actimab-A to participating clinical sites and providing additional support as needed. The CRADA will provide broad support for the development of Actimab-A alone or in combination with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted agents and other novel combinations. The CRADA studies will be overseen by NCI in collaboration with Actinium's clinical development team.



Astellas, LG Chem, and EpicentRx



We are leveraging our clinical experience, robust IP and radiotherapy know-how through research collaborations. Our collaborations with Astellas, LG Chem and EpicentRx establish our work with immunotherapies and in solid tumors. Through our research collaborations, such as with Astellas, we are advancing into solid tumors indications. With Astellas, we are utilizing a diagnostic agent developed in parallel with a therapeutic agent that shares the same target to identify patients who would benefit from the treatment.



Our platform is being utilized in our ongoing research collaboration with Astellas to arm select targeting agents owned by Astellas with the alpha-emitting radioisotope Ac-225 for the development of theranostics for solid tumor indications, which combine the ability of radioisotopes to be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.





18







We are also exploring novel targeted radiotherapies in solid tumors and blood cancers such as HER3 expressing solid tumors in collaboration with LG Chem and combinations with immunotherapies such as CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitors with EpicentRx.



Competition



The biopharmaceutical industry is extremely competitive and rapidly evolving, particularly in the field of oncology and hematology drug development. Our competition is likely to come from larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academia, and other public and private entities that focus on three broad areas relevant to our pipeline candidates – AML drugs, conditioning agents and radiopharmaceuticals. In addition, in markets where we are going after a target, companies with research programs and capabilities in our disease area focus may also be competing with our programs and pipeline.



In AML, the pipeline is crowded with 100+ programs, however, there are a few Phase 3 assets with limited potential that do not represent an imminent, competitive threat to Iomab-B or Actimab-A. None of the Phase 2 development programs in AML show the promise of producing high rates or duration of remission, and most patients that relapse tend to have poor survival outcomes. The Phase 2 assets primarily consist of agents targeting specific AML mutations, immunotherapies, or cell cycle modulators. Early clinical and preclinical stage assets consist of more cell therapy and immune cell engagers, and the potential success of these modalities in AML remain uncertain. Our strategy is to develop Actimab-A in combination with other products, and the agents in the development pipeline have the potential for synergies in combination with Actimab-A.



In conditioning, agents currently used for myeloablation prior to a BMT, lymphodepletion prior to CAR-T and other adoptive cell therapies and reduced intensity conditioning for gene therapy are largely generic, non-targeted chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, Jasper Therapeutics and Magenta Therapeutics ceased development of their antibody and antibody-drug conjugate or ADC conditioning programs for BMT. Certain companies such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (“Vertex”), Gilead Sciences (“Gilead”) and Allogene Therapeutics (“Allogene") have or continue to explore non-chemotherapy conditioning with ADCs and antibodies for their in-house, proprietary cellular therapy programs. For example, Vertex has in-licensed ImmunoGen Inc.’s ADC technology, and had a collaboration with Molecular Templates, Inc. to develop targeted conditioning agents, which was subsequently terminated. Allogene is using its own proprietary anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody for use as a lymphodepletion agent in conjunction with CAR-T therapies. Telix Pharmaceuticals has announced plans for a conditioning program based on a CD66 radiotherapeutic approach in systemic amyloid light-chain amyloidosis (“SALA”) via an early stage investigator sponsored trial. Without exception, all these companies have either preclinical or early-stage programs that are solely focused on their proprietary programs. We believe that we are the only company with a phase 3 completed targeted conditioning asset that has demonstrated clinical benefit with the opportunity to be paradigm-changing.



Several companies are focused on developing radiotherapies, including, but not limited to: Abdera Therapeutics, Aktis Oncology, Bayer AG, Convergent Therapeutics, CuraSight, Fusion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Lantheus Holdings, Inc., Mariana Oncology (previously, Curie Therapeutics), Monopar Therapeutics, Novartis AG, Point Biopharma, Inc., RadioMedix, Inc., Radiopharm Theranostics, Radionetics Oncology, RayzeBio, Inc., Q BioMed, Inc., Telix, and Y-mAbs Therapeutics, Inc.



Government Regulation



Regulatory Compliance



Our research and development activities are all subject to stringent regulation, primarily by the FDA in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and its implementing regulations, and by comparable authorities under similar laws and regulations in other countries. This includes research and development, testing, and oversight of suppliers and contract manufacturers involved in the production of our product candidates we are developing, as well as the design, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, handling, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion and marketing. If, for any reason, we do not comply with applicable requirements, such noncompliance can result in adverse consequences, including delays in approval of, or even the refusal to approve, product licenses or other applications, the suspension or termination of clinical investigations, the revocation of approvals previously granted, as well as fines, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of products, injunctions against shipping products and suspension of production and/or refusals of government contracts.





19







FDA Review Process and Product Approval



Our product candidates are regulated as biologics and must be approved by the FDA before they may be marketed in the U.S. This process generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”) requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, and its safety and efficacy for each indication, in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a BLA for a new biologic, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of a BLA for a new biologic, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the U.S.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, although they may overlap or be combined.




● | Phase 1 studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 studies are conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites designed to provide the data required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, safety and to establish the benefit-risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The results of the preclinical and clinical testing, along with information regarding the manufacturing of the product and proposed product labeling, are evaluated and, if determined appropriate, submitted to the FDA through a BLA. Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s standard goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to a drug that treats a serious condition and would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness qualifying for Priority Review, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.



The FDA offers certain programs, such as Breakthrough Designation (“BTD”) and Fast Track designation, designed to expedite the development and review of applications for products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. For BTD, preliminary clinical evidence of the product indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete, and the product may be eligible for accelerated approval. However, receipt of BTD or Fast Track designation does not ensure that a product will be developed or approved on an expedited basis, or at all.



The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, which includes determining whether it is effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, and applications for new molecular entities and original BLAs are generally discussed at advisory committee meetings unless the FDA determines that this type of consultation is not needed under the circumstances.





20







After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, but the FDA cannot grant approval. A CRL may require additional inspections, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. The FDA could approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.



Post-Approval Requirements



Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences with the biologic, submitting biological product deviation reports to notify the FDA of unanticipated changes in distributed products, establishment registration, compliance with cGMP standards, and certain state licensing requirements.



Additionally, any significant change in the approved product or in how it is manufactured, including changes in formulation or the site of manufacture, generally require prior FDA approval. The packaging and labeling of all products developed by us are also subject to FDA approval and ongoing regulation. Noncompliance with any regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. The commercial distribution of prescription drugs is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), which regulates the distribution of the products at the federal level and sets certain standards for federal or state registration and compliance of entities in the supply chain.



The DSCSA preempts certain previously enacted state laws and the pedigree requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”). Trading partners within the drug supply chain must now ensure certain product tracing requirements are met, and are required to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statements. Product identifier information (an aspect of the product tracing scheme) is also now required. The DSCSA requirements, development of standards, and the system for product tracing have been and will continue to be phased in over a period of years through 2023. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance documents, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates.



Orphan Drug Act



We have received Orphan Drug designation for Iomab-B and Actimab-A for patients with AML. Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant Orphan Drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the U.S., Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer of the approved product cannot assure sufficient quantities. As a result, there can be no assurance that our competitors will not receive approval of drugs or biologics that have a different active ingredient for treatment of the diseases for which our products and product candidates are targeted.

Pediatric Information



Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), certain BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within 60 days of an end of Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor can submit amendments to an initial PSP if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on preclinical data collected, early phase clinical trials as well as other clinical development programs.
Foreign Regulation



In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates, and products being marketed outside of the U.S. We must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than required by the FDA for BLA licensure. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the U.S., we are subject to post-approval regulatory requirements.
Other Regulatory Considerations



We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, The Clean Air Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our products and product candidates, if approved. These laws and regulations include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, aggregate spend reporting, and product price advertising.



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities including pharmaceutical manufacturers from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in case or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, or either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease or order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.



In addition, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended (“ACA”) codified cash law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”). The FCA prohibits individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a claims payment to, or approval by, the federal government that are false, fictitious or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Our activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under the FCA. State statutes and regulations equivalent or substantially similar to the federal laws may extend to items and services reimbursed by commercial insurers and/or by patients directly. State law equivalents to the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act may not have adopted exceptions and safe harbors available at the federal level and therefore, may implicate a broader range of activities.

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or obtain, by any means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Under recent legislation, the Sunshine Act will extend to payments and transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level healthcare providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has the potential to impose penalties for violations of the Sunshine Act, depending on the circumstances, and payments reported under the Sunshine Act also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws.



We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the state governments in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, imposes, among other things, obligations, including mandatory contractual terms with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, and business associates. The HHS Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) has increased its focus on compliance and continues to train state attorneys general for enforcement purposes. Even where HIPAA does not apply, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”), 15 U.S. Code §45(a). Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns, and some state privacy laws apply in broader circumstances than HIPAA.



We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations.



Human Capital



As of March 31, 2023, we had 49 full-time employees, 17 of whom have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 22 of whom are engaged in research and development and clinical development activities. We believe that we have been successful to date in attracting skilled and experienced personnel despite the competitive hiring marketing in the industry. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. We continue to engage external consultants on an as-needed basis to temporarily supplement existing staff.
