ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
Overview 
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on June 11, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination. We have elected to pursue an acquisition in the defense technology industry.
 
On October 31, 2022, we entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Breeze, BH Velocity Merger Sub Inc., a Texas corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Breeze (“Merger Sub”), and TV Ammo, Inc., a Texas corporation (“TV Ammo”). The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the boards of directors of each of Breeze, Merger Sub, and TV Ammo. The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, at the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into TV Ammo (the “Merger”), with TV Ammo surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Breeze. In connection with the Merger, Breeze will change its name to “True Velocity, Inc.”, which is hereinafter referred to (on a post-closing basis) as “True Velocity.” The aggregate consideration to be received by the TV Ammo equity holders is based on a pre-transaction equity value of $1,185,234,565, and results in a combined company equity value of $1,249,556,817. The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the “Business Combination.” The Business Combination is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including the satisfaction of the minimum available cash condition, the receipt of certain governmental approvals and the required approval by the stockholders of Breeze and TV Ammo. For more information regarding the Business Combination, please see “Proposed Business Combination with TV Ammo.”
 
Our management team has extensive experience in taking companies public, acquisitions, divestitures, corporate sales, and equity and debt capital markets transactions. Additionally, our management team has well-established banking relationships and procured several billion dollars of committed capital in connection with prior investments. Our team has experience investing across a variety of commodity price cycles and a track record of identifying high quality assets and businesses with significant resources, capital and optimization potential. 
 In addition, our management team has an intense focus on cost management which we believe will translate into meaningful reductions in overall capital and operating costs. Our management team has consistently demonstrated their commitment to cost management. At EXCO Resources, Inc. (“EXCO”), for example, Dr. Ramsey and Messrs. Griffin and Ross were able to significantly improve EXCO’s drilling and development costs and operating costs through renegotiated rig rates and operating efficiencies.
 
Prior to our initial public offering, 13.9% of our common stock was held by I-Bankers Securities, Inc. I-Bankers is a global provider of financial and advisory services.

 The past performance of the members of our management team, I-Bankers, or their affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management team, I-Bankers, or their affiliates as indicative of our future performance.

Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest”.
 Business Operations
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity through December 31, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation, the Initial Public Offering (“Initial Public Offering”), which is described below, and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after 
 1


the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering and from changes in the fair value of its warrant liability.
 The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on November 23, 2020. On November 25, 2020, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the Units sold, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000.
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 5,425,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Breeze Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”) and I-Bankers Securities, Inc, generating gross proceeds of $5,425,000.
 Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on November 25, 2020, an amount of $115,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and $1,725,000 from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account to the Company’s stockholders, as described below. As of August 11, 2022, all trust proceeds were moved into, and remain held in, a non-interest bearing account.
 Transaction costs incurred in connection with the Initial Public Offering amounted to $4,099,907, consisting of $2,300,000 of underwriting fees, $1,322,350 of representative share offering costs, and $477,557 of other offering costs. As of December 31, 2022, cash of $14,129 was held outside of the Trust Account and was available for working capital purposes.
 The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete an initial Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
 The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.15 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. The per-share amount to be distributed to stockholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants.
 The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased by it during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination.
 If the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 10% or more of the Public Shares, without the Company’s prior written consent.
 2


The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination by November 25, 2021 (which can be extended up to 6 months) and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.    
 On November 22, 2021, the Company announced that its sponsor, Breeze Sponsor, LLC, timely deposited an aggregate of $1,150,000 (the “Extension Payment”), representing $0.10 per public share, into the Trust Account to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 25, 2021 to February 25, 2022. The Sponsor loaned the Extension Payment to the Company in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of the Extension Payment. The loan under the promissory note is non-interest bearing and will be repaid upon the consummation of a business combination. The Company’s stockholders are not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extension.
 On February 22, 2022, the Company announced that its sponsor, Breeze Sponsor, LLC, timely deposited an aggregate of $1,150,000 (the “Second Extension Payment”), representing $0.10 per public share, into the Trust Account to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from February 25, 2022 to May 25, 2022. The Sponsor loaned the Second Extension Payment to the Company in exchange for a promissory note in the amount of the Second Extension Payment. The loan under the promissory note is non-interest bearing and will be repaid upon the consummation of a business combination. The Company’s stockholders are not entitled to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extension. 
 On May 5, 2022, the Company held a stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to September 26, 2022 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.35 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 6,732,987 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed for $69,700,628 (the “Redemption”) with 7,907,013 shares of common stock remaining outstanding after Redemption; 4,767,013 of the 7,907,013 shares of common stock remaining outstanding after redemption (the “Public Shares”) are owned by the public stockholders. The public stockholders will continue to have the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of an initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. 
 On September 13, 2022, the Company held its annual stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to March 26, 2023 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.35 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 3,076,817 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed for $31,845,056, with 4,830,196 shares of common stock remaining outstanding after Redemption; 1,690,196 of the 4,830,196 shares of common stock remaining outstanding after redemption (the “Public Shares”) are owned by the public stockholders. The public stockholders will continue to have the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of an initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.
 Following the redemptions, approximately $17.5 million remained on deposit in our Trust Account. 
 At the annual meeting of the Company held on September 13, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “A&R COI”) to authorize the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2022, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as March 26, 2023) by which the Company must (a) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination, which we refer to as our initial business combination, or (b) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and redeem all of the shares of common stock of the Company included as part of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering that was consummated on November 25, 2020, and (ii) a 
 3


proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. The amended Trust Agreement  authorizes the Company’s Board of Directors to extend the time to complete the Business Combination up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (for a maximum of six one-month extensions), upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $0.035 for each outstanding public share by the Sponsor or its designees on or prior to September 26, 2022 or such other date as may be extended.  Breeze executed its first one month extension of September 26, 2022 depositing $59,157 in the Trust Account. On October 21, 2022, November 23, 2022 and December 20, 2022 Breeze executed the second, third and fourth one month extensions depositing $59,157 in the Trust Account for each monthly extension through January 26, 2023. On January 25, 2023 and February 23, 2023 Breeze executed the fifth and sixth one month extensions depositing $59,157 in the Trust Account for each monthly extension through March 26, 2023. The Company has scheduled a meeting of its stockholders for March 22, 2023 to consider (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s A&R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of March 26, 2023, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as September 26, 2023).
 On March 22, 2023, the Company held a stockholders’ meeting at which a proposal to approve the extension of time to consummate the closing of a Business Combination Agreement to September 26, 2023 was approved. The Company provided its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares at the time of this stockholders’ meeting. The stockholders who elected to redeem their shares did so for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.56 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. In connection with the extension proposal, 509,712 shares of the Company’s common stock were redeemed for $5,395,929, with 4,320,484 shares of common stock remaining outstanding after Redemption; 1,180,484 of the 4,320,484 shares of common stock remaining outstanding after redemption (the “Public Shares”) are owned by the public stockholders. The public stockholders will continue to have the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of an initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.
 Following the redemptions, approximately $12.5 million remained on deposit in our Trust Account. 
 At the meeting of the Company held on March 22, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “A&R COI”) to authorize the Company to extend the date of March 26, 2023, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as September 26, 2023) by which the Company must (a) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination, which we refer to as our initial business combination, or (b) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete such initial business combination, and redeem all of the shares of common stock of the Company included as part of the units sold in the Company’s initial public offering that was consummated on November 25, 2020, and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. The amended Trust Agreement  authorizes the Company’s Board of Directors to extend the time to complete the Business Combination up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (for a maximum of six one-month extensions), upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $0.035 for each outstanding public share by the Sponsor or its designees on or prior to September 26, 2023 or such other date as may be extended.
 The Company will have until September 26, 2023 (unless the Company’s shareholders approve a proposal to amend the A&R COI to permit an extension of up to six additional one month periods) to complete a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.
 In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.35 per Public Share or (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek 
 4


access to the Trust Account and will not apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
 
Termination of Proposed Business Combination with D-Orbit S.p.A.
 
As previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 27, 2022, on January 26, 2022, the Company (or “Breeze”), entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Combination Agreement”), by and among Breeze, D-Orbit S.p.A, an Italian Società per azioni (“D-Orbit”), D-Orbit S.A., a newly-formed joint stock company (société anonyme) governed by the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“Holdco”), Lift-Off Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”), and Seraphim Space (Manager) LLP, a UK limited liability partnership. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination”), Holdco would become the NASDAQ-listed parent company of both Breeze and D-Orbit, with the former Breeze stockholders (including the Sponsor) owning pro forma approximately 11% and former D-Orbit shareholders owning approximately 84% of the Holdco Shares outstanding immediately after closing, assuming no redemptions.
 
Concurrently with the execution of the Combination Agreement, certain parties to the Combination Agreement entered into Ancillary Agreements (as defined in the Combination Agreement) in connection with the Business Combination and as specifically contemplated by the Combination Agreement.
 
Prior to execution of the Combination Agreement, on January 26, 2022, Breeze, Holdco and D-Orbit entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with an entity managed by ATW Partners, LLC (the “Debenture Investor”), pursuant to which the Debenture Investor agreed to purchase, and Holdco agreed to issue and sell to the Debenture Investor, on the Closing Date an aggregate principal amount of $30,000,000 of Holdco’s Original Issue Discount Convertible Debentures (the “Debentures”) due four years from their date of issuance (the “Debenture Financing”). 
 
On July 28, 2022, the parties to the Securities Purchase Agreement entered into a Termination of Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Termination Agreement”) which terminated the Securities Purchase Agreement, effective as of July 28, 2022. In connection with the termination, the Debenture Investor refunded to D-Orbit a portion of a commitment fee previously paid by D-Orbit to the Debenture Investor.
 
On August 12, 2022, the parties to the Combination Agreement entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) which terminated the Combination Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, effective as of August 12, 2022. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Company will not be obligated to remit nor will it be entitled to receive a termination payment.
 
Proposed Business Combination with TV Ammo

On October 31, 2022, Breeze Holdings Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Breeze”), entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Breeze, BH Velocity Merger Sub Inc., a Texas corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Breeze (“Merger Sub”), and TV Ammo, Inc., a Texas corporation (“TV Ammo”).
 
The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the boards of directors of each of Breeze, Merger Sub, and TV Ammo.
 
The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things, at the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into TV Ammo (the “Merger”), with TV Ammo surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Breeze. In connection with the Merger, Breeze will change its name to “True Velocity, Inc.”, which is hereinafter referred to (on a post-closing basis) as “True Velocity.” The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are hereinafter referred to as the “Business Combination.”
 
The Business Combination is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, including the satisfaction of the minimum available cash condition, the receipt of certain governmental approvals and the required approval by the stockholders of Breeze and TV Ammo.
 
The aggregate consideration to be received by the TV Ammo equity holders is based on a pre-transaction equity value of $1,185,234,565, and results in a combined company equity value of $1,249,556,817. In accordance with the terms and subject to the 
 5


conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), (a) each share of issued and outstanding TV Ammo common stock, par value $0.01 (“TV Ammo Common Stock”), shall be cancelled and converted into a number of shares of True Velocity common stock, par value $0.0001 (“True Velocity Common Stock”), equal to  the Exchange Ratio described below, (b) each option to purchase shares of TV Ammo Common Stock (each, a “TV Ammo Option”) shall be assumed and converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of True Velocity Common Stock equal to the number of shares of TV Ammo Common Stock subject to such TV Ammo Option, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price per share in effect immediately before the Effective Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio, (c) each restricted stock unit in respect of shares of TV Ammo Common Stock (each, a “TV Ammo RSU”) shall be assumed and converted into a restricted stock unit in respect of a number of shares of True Velocity Common Stock equal to the number of shares of TV Ammo Common Stock subject to such TV Ammo RSU, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and (d) each warrant to purchase a number of shares of TV Ammo Common Stock (each, a “TV Ammo Warrant”) shall be converted into a warrant to purchase shares of True Velocity Common Stock  equal to the number of shares of TV Ammo Common Stock subject to such TV Ammo Warrant, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share equal to the exercise price per share in effect immediately before the Effective Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio will be equal to (i) the sum of (A) $1,185,234,565, plus (B) any amounts raised by TV Ammo after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Closing in permitted financing transactions in excess of $50,000,000, plus (C) the aggregate dollar amount payable to TV Ammo upon the conversion of all outstanding TV Ammo convertible notes and the exercise of all vested in-the-money TV Ammo Warrants and vested in-the-money TV Ammo Options, divided by (ii) the number of fully-diluted shares of TV Ammo Common Stock outstanding as of the Closing, further divided by (iii) an assumed value of True Velocity Common Stock of $10.00 per share.
 
A pro rata portion of the shares of True Velocity Common Stock received in exchange for the shares of TV Ammo Common Stock are subject to forfeiture if certain future stock-price based milestones are not achieved as described below (the “Earnout Shares”). The number of Earnout Shares will be equal to the product of (a) 15% and (b) the amount by which 118,523,456 exceeds the number of shares of True Velocity Common Stock issuable upon the exercise or conversion of securities issued by TV Ammo in permitted financing transactions after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Closing. The Earnout Shares will be issued at the Closing and subject to forfeiture. One-half of the Earnout Shares shall become fully vested and no longer subject to forfeiture if, during the three-year period beginning at the Closing (the “Milestone Event Period”), the True Velocity Common Stock achieves a daily volume weighted average closing sale price of at least $12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 consecutive trading day period (“Milestone Event I”). The other half of the Earnout Shares will become fully vested and no longer subject to forfeiture if, during the Milestone Event Period, the True Velocity Common Stock achieves a daily volume weighted average closing sale price of at least $15.00 per share for a similar number of days (“Milestone Event II”). The 30 consecutive trading day periods used to satisfy Milestone Event I and Milestone Event II may not overlap; if both Milestone Event I and Milestone Event II would be satisfied using the same 30 consecutive trading day period, Milestone Event II will be deemed satisfied and the threshold closing sale price to achieve Milestone Event I shall be increased to $13.50. Any Earnout Shares that remain unvested at the end of the Milestone Event Period will be forfeited. All of the Earnout Shares will become fully vested and no longer subject to forfeiture upon the occurrence of a transaction or series of transactions occurring after the Closing (a) following which a person or “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of persons (other than True Velocity, TV Ammo or any of their respective subsidiaries), has direct or indirect beneficial ownership of securities (or rights convertible or exchangeable into securities) representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power of True Velocity or the right to elect a majority of the True Velocity board of directors or similar governing body of True Velocity, (b) constituting a sale, merger, business combination, consolidation, liquidation, exchange offer or other similar transaction, however effected, following which the voting securities of True Velocity immediately prior to such transaction do not continue to represent or are not converted into at least (50%) of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the person resulting from such transaction or, if the surviving company is a subsidiary, the ultimate parent thereof, or (c) constituting a sale, lease, license or other disposition of fifty percent (50%) or more of the assets of True Velocity and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (any of the foregoing, a “Subsequent Transaction”).
 
The parties have agreed to take actions such that, effective immediately after the Closing of the Business Combination, True Velocity’s board of directors shall consist of seven directors, consisting of two Breeze designees (at least one of whom shall be an “independent director”), four TV Ammo designees (at least three of whom shall be “independent directors”) and the chief executive officer of True Velocity. True Velocity’s executive management team will be led by the current management of TV Ammo. To qualify as an “independent director” under the Merger Agreement, a designee shall both (a) qualify as “independent” under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market and (b) not have had any business relationship with either Breeze or TV Ammo or any of their respective subsidiaries, including as an officer or director thereof, other than for a period of less than six months prior to the date of the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants of each of the parties thereto that are customary for transactions of this type, including, among others, covenants providing for (a) certain limitations on the operation of the parties’ respective businesses prior to consummation of the Business Combination, (b) the parties’ efforts to satisfy conditions to consummation of the Business Combination, including by obtaining necessary approvals from governmental agencies (including U.S. federal antitrust authorities and under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”)), (c)

prohibitions on the parties soliciting alternative transactions, (d) Breeze preparing and filing a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and taking certain other actions to obtain the requisite approval of Breeze’s stockholders to vote in favor of certain matters, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Business Combination, at a special meeting to be called for the approval of such matters, and (e) the protection of, and access to, confidential information of the parties.
 
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Breeze has prepared and filed with the SEC a proxy statement (the “Extension Proxy Statement”), for the purpose of amending the Breeze organizational documents and the Trust Agreement, in each case, to extend the time period for Breeze to consummate a Business Combination from March 26, 2023 up to September 26, 2023 (the “Extension Proposal”). Breeze filed and distributed the Extension Proxy Statement to solicit proxies thereunder and will hold a meeting of the stockholders of Breeze to consider, vote on and approve the Extension Proposal on March 22, 2023.
 
The parties to the Merger Agreement agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to enter into an at-the-market facility (“At-the-Market Facility”) prior to the Closing on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to Breeze and TV Ammo.
 
 In addition, Breeze’s board of directors has agreed to adopt, subject to stockholder approval, an equity incentive plan, as described in the Merger Agreement, for the purpose of providing a means through which to enhance the ability to attract, retain and motivate persons who make (or are expected to make) important contributions to True Velocity by providing these individuals with equity ownership opportunities and/or equity-linked compensatory opportunities.
 
The obligations of Breeze and TV Ammo to consummate the Business Combination are subject to the fulfillment (or waiver) of certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (a) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, (b) the approval of Breeze’s stockholders, (c) the approval of TV Ammo’s stockholders, and (d) Breeze’s Form S-4 registration statement becoming effective.
 
In addition, the obligations of Breeze and Merger Sub to consummate the Business Combination are also subject to the fulfillment (or waiver) of other closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (a) the representations and warranties of TV Ammo being true and correct to the standards applicable to such representations and warranties and each of the covenants of TV Ammo having been performed or complied with in all material respects, (b) delivery of certain ancillary agreements required to be executed and delivered in connection with the Business Combination; and (c) no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) having occurred.
 
 The obligation of TV Ammo to consummate the Business Combination is also subject to the fulfillment (or waiver) of other closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (a) the representations and warranties of Breeze and Merger Sub being true and correct to the standards applicable to such representations and warranties and each of the covenants of Breeze and Merger Sub having been performed or complied with in all material respects, (b) the shares of True Velocity Common Stock issuable in connection with the Business Combination being listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and (c) Breeze having cash on hand (inclusive of proceeds from certain permitted financing transactions) of at least $30,000,000 (after deducting any amounts paid to Breeze stockholders that exercise their redemption rights in connection with the Business Combination and net of certain transaction expenses incurred by Breeze or TV Ammo). If Breeze’s cash on hand is less than $30,000,000, (i) after the Breeze stockholder meeting to approve the Business Combination, Breeze may sell additional shares of Breeze Common Stock to investors for not less than $10.00 per share (“Additional Financing”), and (ii) after the deadline for Breeze stockholders to elect to redeem their Breeze Common Stock in connection with the Business Combination, Breeze may, with the consent of TV Ammo, enter into agreements incentivizing redeeming stockholders to unwind their election to redeem. The Sponsor has agreed to forfeit up to 20% of its shares of Breeze Common Stock to allow Breeze to offer shares in connection with any such incentive agreements.
 
The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the Closing of the Business Combination, including, but not limited to, (a) by mutual written consent of Breeze and TV Ammo, (b) by Breeze, on the one hand, or TV Ammo, on the other hand, if there is any breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the other party as set forth in the Merger Agreement, in each case, such that certain conditions to Closing cannot be satisfied and the breach or breaches of such representations or warranties or the failure to perform such covenants or agreements, as applicable, are not cured or cannot be cured within certain specified time periods, (c) by either Breeze or TV Ammo if the Business Combination is not consummated by April 28, 2023, provided the failure to close by such date is not due to a breach by the terminating party, (d) by either Breeze or TV Ammo if a meeting of Breeze’s stockholders is held to vote on proposals relating to the Business Combination and the stockholders do not approve the proposals, and (e) by Breeze if the TV Ammo stockholders do not approve the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby within five days after Breeze’s registration statement on Form S-4 becomes effective.

 Under certain circumstances as described further in the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by Breeze, TV Ammo will pay Breeze a fee equal to the actual documented expenses incurred by Breeze in connection with the Business Combination of up to $1,000,000.
 
 A copy of the Merger Agreement is included as Exhibit 2.1 in our Current Report filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on November 1, 2022 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto. The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of the Merger Agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the agreement among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement are also modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules which are not filed publicly and which are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to stockholders and were used for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Breeze does not believe that these schedules contain information that is material to an investment decision.
 
 The Merger Agreement contemplates that TV Ammo may enter into agreements to raise capital in one or more private placement transactions prior to the Closing of the Business Combination for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $100,000,000 (the “Permitted Financing”).
 
 Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Breeze, TV Ammo, the Sponsor, I-Bankers and the independent directors of Breeze (current and former) (collectively, the “Breeze Initial Stockholders”)  entered into a sponsor support agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, the Breeze Initial Stockholders: (a) agreed to vote all of their shares of Breeze Common Stock in favor of the proposals to be submitted to the Breeze stockholders in connection with the Business Combination, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Business Combination and the Extension Proposal; (b) agreed to vote against any other matter, action, agreement, transaction or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in (i) a breach of any of Breeze’s or Merger Sub’s representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations under the Merger Agreement or (ii) any of the mutual or TV Ammo conditions to the Closing in the Merger Agreement not being satisfied; (c) (i) waived, subject to and conditioned upon the Closing and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and the Breeze organizational documents, and (ii) agreed not to assert or perfect, any rights to adjustment or other anti-dilution protections to which such Breeze Initial Stockholder may be entitled in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions or the Extension Proposal; (d) agreed to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary under applicable laws to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement prior to any valid termination of the Merger Agreement; (e) agreed not to transfer or pledge any of their shares of Breeze Common Stock, or enter into any arrangement with respect thereto, after the execution of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, subject to certain customary conditions and exceptions; and (f) waived their rights to redeem any of their shares of Breeze Common Stock in connection with the approval of the Breeze Proposals and the Extension Proposal. Additionally, the Sponsor has agreed to: (a) forfeit for no consideration up to 20% of the aggregate shares of Breeze Common Stock held by it if Breeze reasonably determines that the issuance of additional shares of Breeze Common Stock to investors or redeeming Breeze stockholders (at a price per share not to be less than $10.00) would be reasonably required (i) to cause the Breeze Cash on Hand to be at least equal to the Minimum Cash Amount or (ii) to secure any Additional Financing; (b) forfeit for no consideration up to 20% of the aggregate shares of Breeze Common Stock held by it if, on the six month anniversary of the Closing, the sum of (i) the Breeze’s cash on hand at the Closing plus (ii) the funds requested or received under the At-the-Market Facility (or other similar equity or hybrid equity-based instrument or facility) at or prior to such date is less than $50,000,000; and (c) assume and pay all Breeze transaction expenses incurred in connection with the D-Orbit transaction in full and indemnify Breeze, TV Ammo and their respective subsidiaries from any and all liabilities related thereto, and to not sell or transfer any of its shares of Breeze Common Stock or distribute any of its assets unless and until such time as it has assumed and paid in full all such Breeze transaction expenses.
 
 The foregoing description of the Sponsor Support Agreement is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Sponsor Support Agreement, a copy of which is included as Exhibit 10.1 in our Current Report filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on November 1, 2022, and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 On November 9, 2022, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Breeze, TV Ammo and certain TV Ammo equity holders representing approximately 66.34% of the issued and outstanding shares of TV Ammo Common Stock executed a stockholder support agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, such TV Ammo equity holders: (a) agreed to vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the ancillary agreements referenced therein to which TV Ammo is a party; (b) agreed to approve, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the TV Ammo organizational documents, the conversion of all outstanding shares of TV Ammo preferred stock into shares of TV Ammo Common Stock to take effect immediately prior to the Closing; (c) agreed to waive any appraisal or similar rights they may have pursuant to the Texas Business Organizations Code with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the ancillary agreements referenced therein; (d) agreed to vote against any other matter, action, agreement, transaction or proposal that would reasonably be expected to result in (i) a breach of any of TV Ammo’s representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or obligations under the Merger Agreement or (ii) any of the mutual or Breeze or Merger Sub

conditions to the Closing in the Merger Agreement not being satisfied; and (e) agreed not to sell, assign, transfer or pledge any of their shares of TV Ammo Common Stock or TV Ammo preferred stock (or enter into any arrangement with respect thereto) after the execution of the Merger Agreement and prior to the Closing date, subject to certain customary conditions and exceptions.
 
On November 9, 2022, Breeze, TV Ammo, the Breeze Initial Stockholders and certain TV Ammo equity holders entered into a lock-up agreement (the “Lock-Up Agreement”), pursuant to which the Breeze Initial Stockholders and such TV Ammo equity holders have agreed, among other things, to refrain from selling or transferring their shares of True Velocity Common Stock for a period of eight months following the Closing, subject to early release (a) of 10% of their shares of True Velocity Common Stock if the daily volume weighted average closing sale price of True Velocity Common Stock quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period exceeds $12.50 per share, (b) of an additional 10% of their shares of True Velocity Common Stock if the daily volume weighted average closing sale price of True Velocity Common Stock quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period exceeds $15.00 per share; (c) of all of their shares of True Velocity Common Stock upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Transaction; and (d) upon the determination of the True Velocity board of directors (including a majority of the independent directors) following the six month anniversary of the Closing date.
 
On November 9, 2022, Breeze, the Breeze Initial Stockholders and certain TV Ammo equity holders entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), which amended the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement entered into by Breeze and the Breeze Initial Stockholders on November 23, 2020, pursuant to which, among other things, Breeze will be obligated to file a registration statement to register the resale of certain securities of Breeze held by the Breeze Initial Stockholders and such TV Ammo equity holders. The Registration Rights Agreement also provides the Breeze Initial Stockholders and such TV Ammo equity holders with “piggy-back” registration rights, subject to certain requirements and customary conditions.
 
The foregoing description of the Stockholder Support Agreement, the Lock-Up Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement are subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Stockholder Support Agreement, Lock-Up Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, respectively, copies of which are attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibits 10.14, 10.15and 10.16, respectively, and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Except as specifically discussed, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not assume the closing of the Business Combination with TV Ammo. 
 
Business Strategy & Competitive Strengths 
 Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company in North America that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from their operational expertise and/or executive oversight. Our acquisition strategy leverages our management team’s network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses or properties to improve their overall value proposition.
 We utilized the network and industry experience of our management team and business partners in seeking an initial business combination and employing our acquisition strategy. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and industry relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. This network has been developed through our management team’s extensive experience. In addition to our industry and lending community relationships, we leverage relationships with management teams of public and private companies, capital market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, restructuring advisers, attorneys and accounting firms, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. Members of our management team are communicating with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target business and a potential business combination and have identified a target and executed a Business Combination Agreement.
 Acquisition Strategy 
 Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more companies that we believe: 

• | have the ability to generate significant current free cash flow;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | have potential to generate significant growth in shareholder value following our initial business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques and technology, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | can utilize the extensive networks, operational experience and insights of our management team;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are fundamentally sound but we believe can achieve better results by leveraging the operating and financial experience of our management team and their affiliates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital, and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | can offer attractive risk-adjusted returns on investments for our stockholders.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We seek to acquire the target on terms and in a manner that leverage our management team’s investing experience. Potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of the initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management deems relevant. In the event that our initial business combination with a target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC. 
 
In evaluating the target business, we conducted a thorough due diligence review that encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that is made available to us. In conducting our due diligence review, we leveraged the experience of members of our management team and I-Bankers on an efficient and cost-effective basis as we deployed them to review matters related to their specific areas of functional expertise. 
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, or an independent accounting firm (exclusive of our registered independent public accounting firm) that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 
Members of our management team, our sponsor and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether the target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating the particular business combination target if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
  Our executive officers are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combination targets and monitoring the related due diligence. 
 Our sponsor and executive officers have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 18 months after the closing of our initial public offering; provided that this agreement would not prevent our executive officers from serving as directors in other blank check companies. 
 10


Neither I-Bankers nor any of its affiliates has entered into such an agreement, and, accordingly, are not precluded from participating in any other blank check company or from underwriting an offering by any other blank check company. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 As required by NASDAQ rules, our initial business combination will be approved by a majority of our independent directors. NASDAQ rules also require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the “Investment Company Act”. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NASDAQ’s 80% of fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 
 Our Business Combination Process 
 In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that may encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate. 
 We will also leverage our operational and capital allocation experience in order to: 
 
 
• | Assemble a team of industry and financial experts: For each potential transaction, we intend to assemble a team of industry and financial experts to supplement our management’s efforts to identify and resolve key issues facing the company. We intend to construct an operating and financial plan which optimizes the potential to grow shareholder value. With extensive experience investing in both healthy and underperforming businesses, we expect that our management will be able to demonstrate to the target business and its stakeholders that we have the resources and expertise to lead the combined company through complex and often turbulent market conditions and provide the strategic and operational direction necessary to grow the business in order to maximize cash flows and improve the overall strategic prospects for the business;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conduct rigorous research and analysis: Performing disciplined, bottom-up fundamental research and analysis is core to our strategy, and we intend to conduct extensive due diligence to evaluate the impact that a transaction may have on the target business;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquire the target company at an attractive price relative to our view of its intrinsic value: Combining rigorous bottom-up analysis as well as input from industry and financial experts, the management team intends to develop its view of the intrinsic value of the potential business combination. In doing so, the management team will evaluate future cash flow potential, relative industry valuation metrics and precedent transactions to inform its view of intrinsic value, with the intention of creating a business combination at an attractive price relative to such view;

Corporate Information 
 Our executive offices are located at 955 W. John Carpenter Fwy., Suite 100-929, Irving, TX 75039 and our telephone number is (619) 500-7747. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.
 
Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us.
 Furthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 
 Financial Position 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $17.7 million held in the trust account. With the funds available, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to 
 12


use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
 Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
 We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination, shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 We anticipate that target business candidates will continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Report or the final prospectus relating to our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their respective industry and business contacts as well as their affiliates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arms-length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction; in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Although none of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $5,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate. 
 13


If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us. 
 
Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. 
 Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
 Following an initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 
Type of Transaction | Whether StockholderApproval Is Required | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+----
Purchase of assets | | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | | No 
Merger of the company with a target | | Yes

 
Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
 
 
• | we issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of our Securities 
 If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and NASDAQ rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business combination. 
 The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements
 
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of February 27, 2023 the amount in the trust account is $10.56 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 
 15


Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination 
 We had until 12 months from the closing of our initial public offering to consummate our initial business combination. However, by resolution of our board and at the request by our sponsor, we extended the period of time to 18 months to consummate a business combination exercising two 3-month extensions. Pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC on the date of our initial public offering, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadlines, deposited into the trust account for each three-month extension, $1,150,000, or $0.10 per share, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, up to an aggregate of $2,300,000, or $0.20 per share. At the annual meeting of the Company held on September 13, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved a proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “A&R COI”) to authorize the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2022, up to six (6) times for an additional one (1) month each time (ultimately until as late as March 26, 2023) upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $0.035 for each outstanding public share by the Sponsor or its designees on or prior to September 26, 2022 or such other date as may be extended. Any such payments were made in the form of a loan. Any such loans are non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. If we do not complete a business combination, we will not repay such loans. Furthermore, the letter agreement with our initial stockholders contains a provision pursuant to which our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loans out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete a business combination. We issued a press release announcing our intention to extend in both cases at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, for each extension we issued a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing that the funds had been timely deposited. Investors do not have the ability to vote or redeem their shares of common stock in connection with either of the three-month extensions. However, if we seek to complete a business combination during an extension period, investors will still be able to vote and redeem their shares of common stock in connection with that business combination.
 Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, Breeze has prepared and filed with the SEC the Extension Proxy Statement, for the purpose of amending the Breeze organizational documents and the Trust Agreement, in each case, to extend the time period for Breeze to consummate a Business Combination from March 26, 2023 up to September 26, 2023 (the “Extension Proposal”). Breeze filed and distributed the Extension Proxy Statement to solicit proxies thereunder and held a meeting of the stockholders of Breeze to consider, vote on and approve the Extension Proposal on March 22, 2023. Breeze stockholders approved the Extension Proposal and extended the time period for Breeze to consummate a Business Combination from March 26, 2023 up to September 26, 2023.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under NASDAQ rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial business combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on NASDAQ, we are required to comply with such rules. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 
 
• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 16


In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 
 If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 
 
• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders’ founder shares and representative shares, initially we needed to have only 4,187,501, or 36.4%, of the 11,500,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved. As of March 24, 2023, no public shares are required to approve the business combination. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 10% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we 
 17


refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 10% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 10% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
 Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initial vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete another initial business combination with a different target until 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering. 
 18


Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 
 Prior to our proxy extension voted on in May and September, we had only 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 18-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 18-month time period. 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 18-month time period. 
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $14,129 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2022), and amounts raised after December 31, 2022, if any, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution as of March 26, 2023, would be approximately $10.595. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.595. Under Section 281(b) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as amended (the “DGCL”), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if 
 19


management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our initial public offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. 
 In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.595 per public share and (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, and our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.595 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.595 per public share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $14,129 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2022), and amounts raised after December 31, 2022, if any, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently 
 20


unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 18th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.595 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.595 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established 
 21


and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
 Facilities 
 Our executive offices are located at 955 W. John Carpenter Fwy., Suite 100-929, Irving, TX 75039 and our telephone number is (619) 500-7747. Our executive offices are provided to us by our sponsor. Commencing on the date our securities were first listed on NASDAQ, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $5,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. 
Employees 
 We currently have four executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our common stock, rights and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 
22



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
