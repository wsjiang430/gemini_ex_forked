At least 90% of our assets consist of qualified opportunity zone property. We qualified as a qualified opportunity fund beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. Because we are a qualified opportunity fund certain of our investors are eligible for favorable capital gains tax treatment on their investments.

Our initial investments consist of and are expected to continue to consist of properties located in qualified opportunity zones for the development or redevelopment of multifamily, student housing, senior living, healthcare, industrial, self-storage, hospitality, office, mixed-use, data centers and solar projects located throughout the United States and its territories. We also anticipate identifying, acquiring, developing or redeveloping and managing a wide range of commercial real estate properties located throughout the United States and its territories, including, but not limited to, real estate-related assets, such as commercial real estate loans and mortgages, and debt and equity securities issued by other real estate-related companies, as well as making private equity acquisitions and investments, and opportunistic acquisitions of other qualified opportunity funds and qualified opportunity zone businesses, with the goal of increasing distributions and capital appreciation.
 
Our investment guidelines delegate to our Manager discretion and authority to execute acquisitions and dispositions of investments (including the reinvestment of capital basis and gains), provided such investments are consistent with our investment objectives and strategy and our investment guidelines. Our Manager’s investment committee will periodically review our portfolio of assets and investments, our investment objectives and strategy and our investment guidelines to determine whether they remain in the best interests of our members and may recommend changes to our Board as it deems appropriate. We may, at any time and without member approval, cease to be a qualified opportunity fund and acquire assets that do not qualify as qualified opportunity zone investments. Furthermore, there are no prohibitions in our Operating Agreement on the amount or percentage of assets that may be invested in a single property.
 
Qualified Opportunity Zone Program
 
The opportunity zone program is a community development program established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to encourage new long-term investment in low-income urban and rural communities nationwide. The opportunity zone program provides a tax incentive for investors to re-invest their unrealized capital gains into qualified opportunity funds dedicated to investing in “qualified opportunity zones.” Qualified opportunity zones are census tracts identified and nominated by the chief executives of every state and territory of the United States (e.g., state governors) and designated by the Secretary of the Treasury.
 
There are more than 8,700 qualified opportunity zones throughout the United States and its territories.
 
A “qualified opportunity fund” is generally defined as an investment vehicle that is taxed as a corporation or partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and organized to invest in, and at least 90% of its assets consist of, qualified opportunity zone property (the “90% Asset Test”). A qualified opportunity fund must determine whether it meets the 90% Asset Test on each of (i) the last day of the first six-month period of its taxable year, and (ii) the last day of its taxable year (each a “Test Date”).
 
The opportunity zone regulations allow a qualified opportunity fund to apply the 90% Asset Test without taking into account any investments received in the 6-month period preceding the Test Date, provided those investments are (i) received (a) solely in exchange for stock by a qualified opportunity fund that is a corporation, or (b) as a contribution by a qualified opportunity fund that is a partnership, and (ii) held continuously from the fifth business day after the exchange or contribution, as applicable, through the Test Date in cash, cash equivalents or debt instruments with a term of 18 months or less.
 
Subject to a one-time six-month cure period, for each month following a Test Date in which a qualified opportunity fund fails to meet the 90% Asset Test it will incur a penalty equal to (a) the excess of 90% of the fund’s aggregate assets over the aggregate amount of qualified opportunity zone property held by the fund, multiplied by (b) the short-term federal interest rate plus 3%. However, notwithstanding a qualified opportunity fund’s failure to meet the 90% Asset Test, no penalty will be imposed if the fund demonstrates that its failure is due to reasonable cause.
 
We initially qualified as a qualified opportunity fund beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020.
 
An eligible investor may defer recognition of capital gains (short-term or long-term) resulting from the sale or exchange of capital assets (or business assets the gain on the sale of which is treated as capital gain) by reinvesting those gains into a qualified opportunity fund within a period of 180 days generally beginning on the date of the sale or exchange (the “Deferred Capital Gains”). The 180-day period generally begins on the day on which the gains would be recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes had they not been reinvested into a qualified opportunity fund. Deferred Capital Gains are recognized on the earlier of December 31, 2026 or the date on which an inclusion event occurs, such as the date on which the investor sells its qualified opportunity fund investment.

All individuals and entities that recognize capital gains for U.S. federal income tax purposes are eligible to elect to defer their capital gains by investing in a qualified opportunity fund within the applicable 180-day period. This includes natural persons as well as entities such as corporations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), partnerships and other pass-through entities (including, certain common trust funds, qualified settlement funds, and disputed ownership funds). Eligible investors must make deferral elections on Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets, which will need to be attached to their U.S. federal income tax returns for the taxable year in which the capital gain would have been recognized had it not been deferred. In addition, Form 8997, Initial and Annual Statement of Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments, requires eligible investors holding a qualified opportunity fund investment at any point during the tax year to report: (i) qualified opportunity fund investments holdings at the beginning and end of the tax year; (ii) current tax year capital gains deferred by investing in a qualified opportunity fund; and (iii) qualified opportunity fund investments disposed of during the tax year. Eligible investors who have not properly followed the instructions for Form 8997, Initial and Annual Statement of Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments, may receive a Letter 6502, Reporting Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments, or a Letter 6503, Annual Reporting of Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments, from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) if the IRS is missing information, the investor entered invalid information, or the requirements to maintain a qualifying investment have not been followed. Eligible investors who receive a Letter 6502, Reporting Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments, or a Letter 6503, Annual Reporting of Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments, may need to file an amended return or an administrative adjustment request with a properly completed Form 8997, Initial and Annual Statement of Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF) Investments.
 
An eligible investor may elect to increase the tax basis with respect to its qualified opportunity fund investment interest to the fair market value of the investment interest, and similarly may elect to exclude from income gains from sales of non-inventory assets by the qualified opportunity fund, if the investor holds the qualified opportunity fund investment interest for a period of ten years or more prior to the date of sale, up to December 31, 2047. Provided these requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes an eligible investor will not be required to pay federal income tax on a sale of its qualified opportunity fund investment interest. This benefit will not be available with respect to sales or exchanges after December 31, 2047.

Joint Venture and Other Co-Ownership Arrangements
 
Each of our assets has either an affiliate of our Sponsor or Manager, such as Belpointe SP, LLC (“Belpointe SP”), or their respective affiliates (together with Belpointe SP, the “Belpointe SP Group”), or an independent third party, or any combination of the foregoing, as the sponsor or co-sponsor, general partner or co-general partner, manager or co-manager, developer or co-developer of the investment (each an “Investment Partner”), and our role, in general, is as a passive investor.
 
Entering into joint venture investments aligns our interests with the interests of our Investment Partner for the benefit of the holders of our Class A units by leveraging of our capital resources and our Investment Partner’s extensive industry relationships and significant acquisition, development and management expertise to: (i) achieve potentially greater returns on our invested capital; (ii) diversify our access to investment opportunities; and (iii) promote our brand and potentially increase our market share.
 
Borrowing Policy
 
We intend to employ leverage in order to provide more funds available for investment. Leverage will allow us to make more investments than would otherwise be possible, resulting in a broader portfolio. We believe that careful use of conservatively structured leverage will help us to achieve our diversification goals and potentially enhance the returns on our investments. We also believe that our Sponsor’s ability to obtain both competitive financings and its relationships with top tier financial institutions will allow our Manager to access and successfully employ competitively priced borrowing.
 
Our targeted aggregate property-level leverage, excluding any debt at the Company level or on assets under development or redevelopment, after we have acquired a substantial portfolio of stabilized commercial real estate, is between 50-70% of the greater of the cost (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves) or the fair market value of our assets. During the period when we are acquiring, developing and redeveloping our investments, we may employ greater leverage on individual assets. An example of property-level leverage is a mortgage loan secured by an individual property or portfolio of properties incurred or assumed in connection with our acquisition of such property or portfolio of properties. An example of debt at the Company level is a line of credit obtained by us or our Operating Companies.
 
Our Manager may from time to time modify our leverage policy in its discretion in light of then-current economic conditions, relative costs of debt and equity capital, market values of our assets, general conditions in the market for debt and equity securities, growth and acquisition opportunities or other factors. There is no limit on the amount we may borrow with respect to any individual property or portfolio. For an overview of our borrowings, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Disposition Policies
 
The period that we will hold our investments will vary depending on a number of factors, including the type of investment, interest rates and economic and market conditions. Our Manager’s investment committee will develop a well-defined exit strategy for each investment we make and will periodically perform a hold-sell analysis to determine the optimal holding period for generating strong returns. As each of our investments reach what we believe to be its maximum value we will consider disposing of the investment and may do so for the purpose of either distributing the net sale proceeds to holders of our Class A units or investing the proceeds in other investments that we believe may produce a higher overall future return. However, we may sell any or all of our investments before or after their anticipated holding period if, in the judgment of our Manager’s investment committee, selling the investment is in our best interest.
 
The determination of when a particular investment should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of all relevant factors, including prevailing and projected economic and market conditions, whether the value of the investment is anticipated to change substantially, whether we could apply the proceeds from the sale to make other investments consistent with our investment objectives and strategy, whether disposition of the investment would allow us to increase cash flow, and whether the sale of the investment would impact our intended qualification as a publicly traded partnership and qualified opportunity fund.
 
Taxation of the Company
 
We currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If our Manager determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our Manager may elect to treat us as an association or as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes. If we elect to be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes, we may also elect to qualify and be taxed as a REIT.
 
Generally, an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. Rather, each partner is required to take into account its allocable share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the partnership in determining its U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of whether cash distributions are made. Distributions of cash by a partnership to a partner are not taxable unless the amount of cash distributed to a partner is in excess of the partner’s adjusted basis in its partnership interest.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless an exception applies, an entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes may nevertheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a “publicly traded partnership” within the meaning of Section 7704 the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). An entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership is a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code if its interests are (i) traded on an established securities market, or (ii) readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Our Class A units are listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “OZ.” There is, however, an exception to taxation as a corporation which is available if at least 90% of a partnership’s gross income for every taxable year consists of “qualifying income”and the partnership is not required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Qualifying Income Exception”). Qualifying income includes certain interest income (other than from a financial business), dividends, real property rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property and any gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset or other property held for the production of income that otherwise constitutes qualifying income. We intend to manage our affairs so that we will meet the Qualifying Income Exception in each taxable year and so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws, regulations and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, including, among others, (i) federal and state securities laws and regulations, (ii) federal, state and local tax laws and regulations, (iii) state and local laws relating to real property, (iv) federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and (v) various laws relating to housing, including rent control and stabilization laws, the Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988 and Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, among others.

Compliance with the federal, state and local laws is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations, and we do not expect to incur material expenditures to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from various entities for investment opportunities, including other qualified opportunity funds, REITs, Delaware statutory trusts, pension funds, insurance companies, private equity and other alternative investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. In addition to third-party competitors, we may compete for investment opportunities with other programs sponsored by our Sponsor and its affiliates, especially those with investment strategies similar to our own.
 
Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Larger competitors may also enjoy significant advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for investment opportunities may increase over time. Any such increase would result in a greater demand for investment opportunities and could result in our acquiring assets and investments at higher prices or using less than ideal capital structures.
 
In the face of such competition, we expect to greatly benefit from our Manager’s access to our Sponsor’s investment and operating platforms, including without limitation, our Sponsor’s highly experienced management team with significant real estate and asset management expertise, extensive market knowledge and network of industry relationships, which we believe will provide us with our own competitive advantage and will help us source, evaluate and compete for investment opportunities.
 
Human Capital
 
We are externally managed and currently have no employees or intention of having any employees. We rely on our Manager to manage our day-to-day operations, implement our investment objectives and investment strategy and perform certain services for us pursuant to the Management Agreement. These services are provided by individuals who are employees of our Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates.
 
We, our Manager and our Sponsor are a party to an employee and cost sharing agreement (the “Employee and Cost Sharing Agreement”) pursuant to which our Sponsor provides our Manager with access to portfolio management, asset valuation, risk management and asset management services, as well as administration services addressing legal, compliance, investor relations and information technologies necessary for the performance by our Manager of its duties under the Management Agreement. Pursuant to the Management Agreement, our Manager or one or more of its affiliates is entitled to receive expense reimbursements and a quarterly management fee. Pursuant to the Employee and Cost Sharing Agreement, our Sponsor or one or more of its affiliates is entitled to receive expense reimbursements and our Manager’s allocable share of employment costs incurred by the Sponsor.
