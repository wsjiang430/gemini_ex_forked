ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an emerging specialty biotech company with a focus on drug development and commercialization of “small molecule” drugs to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Type 1 diabetes. Companies operating in the drug development and biotech sectors typically in-license early-stage inventions or pre-clinical (stage) compounds from universities and other companies and apply their own drug discovery and development expertise and resources to further these drug candidates towards regulatory approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and potentially other regulatory bodies overseas. The ultimate objectives are to secure regulatory authorizations in the USA and territories internationally, and to generate revenues from marketing activities. Drug candidates may also be licensed (out) to pharmaceutical companies prior to obtaining final regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for valuable consideration, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties.
 
We utilize a “virtual” drug development model, also prevalent in this industry sector. In this model, Contract Research Organizations (CROs) are typically employed to undertake certain drug discovery and development services on the Company’s behalf and under the Company’s direct supervision.
 
A unique feature of Adhera’s accelerated drug development strategy is to identify candidates that have previously been developed for other indications (uses), but where development was discontinued due to lack of efficacy (vs. safety) in these initial indications. The Company secures regulatory approval to commence Phase 2 clinical trials without the need to embark on costly drug discovery or Phase 1 clinical studies. The Company’s most advanced development programs are MLR-1019, a small molecule drug candidate being developed for Parkinson’s disease and MLR-1023 being developed to treat Type 1 diabetes. Both drugs are “clinical-stage,” i.e., are ready to proceed to Phase 2 clinical trials and to Phase 3 clinical trials within 24 months. Both drugs have been shown to be safe and well tolerated in previous clinical trials (in other indications) or following long-term exposure in large numbers of patients. 
 
MLR-1019 in Parkinson’s Disease and L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia
 
PD is a chronic neurodegenerative multi-system disorder. Its defining clinical manifestations are motor disturbances, specifically tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, which are caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. The most effective current treatment for PD is dopamine replacement with the dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA). However, long-term L-DOPA therapy is commonly associated with motor complications that include response fluctuations and involuntary movements called L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID).
 
L-DOPA remains the most common, effective treatment to improve motor symptoms in PD. L-DOPA is initially well-tolerated for many patients and provides substantial improvement in motor function for Parkinson’s patients. However, the long-term use of L-DOPA in patients with PD is often associated with abnormal involuntary movements such as dystonia, chorea and athetosis (collectively referred to as dyskinesias). These L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, referred to as PD-LID, can be as debilitating as the parkinsonian symptoms (lack of movement or akinesia) experienced by patients suffering from PD. Indeed, PD-LID can often limit the dose of L-DOPA that can be safely administered to patients. To the extent that any improvement of the occurrence of PD-LID is observed, it is largely due to an evolving practice of limiting L-DOPA administration and the drug-induced side-effects while potentially compromising direct therapeutic activity.

The pathogenesis of PD-LID remains enigmatic, but it has been shown that sudden changes in dopaminergic stimulation produced by pulsatile L-DOPA treatment plays a role. Because L-DOPA has a relatively short half-life (50 minutes), multiple doses must be administered during a day. Peak dose dyskinesias are the most common dyskinesia, occurring during peaks of L-DOPA-induced dopamine levels in the brain, a time during which the patient experiences the otherwise beneficial effect of L-DOPA in terms of treating the parkinsonian symptoms. Altering the dose and/or timing of L- DOPA can initially alleviate these dyskinesias, but once PD-LID is present, it becomes more difficult to control the clinical response to L-DOPA.
 
The intermittent dosing schedule undertaken with L-DOPA leads to pulsatile stimulation of post- synaptic receptors. It has been suggested that this stimulation leads to downstream changes in proteins and genes, ultimately producing dyskinesias by permanently altering striatal dopaminergic homeostasis. As support for this theory, changes in levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine occur, which may be an attempt to counteract the dysregulation in dopamine levels.
 
Any current option for addressing PD-LID is associated with compromises in patient benefit. Current strategies include preventing the onset of PD-LID by delaying the start of treatment with L-DOPA, or by initially treating with dopamine agonists instead of L-DOPA. Ropinirole and pramipexole are two dopamine agonist drugs that have been shown to help reduce the occurrence of PD-LID but, to date this strategy has been largely unsuccessful. Although the dyskinesias may be reduced, this is achieved at the expense of inadequately treating the parkinsonian symptoms.
 
There are few current strategies available for treating PD-LID once they have occurred. Amantadine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was originally introduced as an antiviral compound to treat influenza and was found to ameliorate parkinsonian symptoms in a patient with PD. Since that original finding, many clinical trials have been conducted investigating the efficacy of amantadine alone and in combination with L-DOPA for treating the symptoms of PD. These clinical trials have shown amantadine to have anti-dyskinetic effects and reduce the severity of PD-LID when given in combination with L-DOPA. However, side effects of amantadine are numerous and significantly limit its use as a practical therapy. These side effects include anxiety, increased impulse control disorders, insomnia, nightmares, blotchy skin, and anti-cholinergic effects. Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors can be used to increase the half-life of L-DOPA by slowing the metabolism of L-DOPA, thereby reducing PD-LID between doses. There are currently two COMT inhibitors on the market, entacapone (Comtan®) and tolcapone (Tasmar®). A third medication, Stalevo®, is a combination of carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone and has proved beneficial for patients with advanced PD and PD-LID symptoms. Tolcapone has been associated with hepatic abnormalities and the FDA is evaluating clinical trial data suggesting that patients taking Stalevo® for PD may be at an increased risk of prostate cancer. The anti-psychotic medication clozapine has been assessed for the treatment of drug-induced psychosis often seen in patients with PD. Some studies have investigated the effectiveness of clozapine in decreasing the dyskinesia’s seen in patients with PD-LID. Although clozapine may show some beneficial effects on dyskinesia and psychosis in PD, patient compliance is poor due to the requirement for a weekly blood draw to monitor for the potential of drug-induced agranulocytosis.
 
At least two invasive procedures have been assessed for treating PD-LID, intra-duodenal infusion of L-DOPA in a specially formulated suspension (Duodopa®) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, the surgical procedures and post-surgical monitoring required for these interventions limit their acceptance. Duodopa® provides L-DOPA delivery directly to the duodenum. The continuous infusion of L-DOPA may prevent the pulsatile stimulation and therefore reduce PD-LID. DBS of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) or the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with implanted electrodes can reduce the severity and duration of PD-LID. Patients receiving this treatment experience significant improvement in PD-LID symptoms, possibly from the reduction in the need for L-DOPA treatments.
 
As successful as this surgery is for treating PD-LID symptoms, not all PD-LID patients can benefit from this procedure. Patients suffering from dementia or other impairments may not qualify to receive treatment in this manner. The fact that procedures that are as invasive as DBS and the administration of Duodopa® are considered a core part of the armamentarium towards PD-LID is a testimony to the debilitating nature of PD-LID and the significant unmet medical need that exists for well-tolerated oral therapeutics to treat this condition.

Rationale for the use of MLR-1019 as a treatment for PD-LID
 
The Company is developing MLR-1019, a highly selective dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, for treating PD-LID. As mentioned previously, dopamine-promoting agents may be effective in treating the dyskinesias associated with chronic L-DOPA treatment in PD patients. MLR-1019 prolongs dopamine activity by blocking dopamine re-uptake through the dopamine transporter (DAT) and in this way MLR-1019 maintains dopamine levels between L-DOPA doses and also stabilizes high flux synaptic dopamine associated with the pulsatile delivery of L-DOPA. Thus, MLR-1019 maintains dopamine “tone” by stabilizing dopamine levels and activity, and thereby dopamine receptor levels and activity, effectively maintaining dopamine homeostasis and reducing dyskinesias (see Figure 1). The remarkable attribute of MLR-1019 is that, it is the only DAT inhibitor that has no pharmacologically relevant activity for the inhibition of other catecholamine transporters (norepinephrine transporter [NET] or serotonin transporter [SERT]), which may be a critical feature for the purpose of PD-LID therapy.
 
Figure 1: Mechanism of action for MLR-1019
 

The Importance of selective DAT inhibition
 
MLR-1019 is the most highly selective dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT) inhibitor that has been described in the scientific literature. It exhibits high selectivity for DAT versus the norepinephrine reuptake transporter (NET) (176-fold; 10-fold higher selectivity that the next most selective DAT inhibitor described) and 1,200- fold selectivity for DAT versus the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) (20-fold greater than the next most selective DAT inhibitor. In fact, the ki values for NET and SERT binding by MLR-1019 are high enough that there should effectively be no amount of NET or SERT inhibition by MLR-1019 at the doses typically administered in vivo. In this respect MLR-1019 is the only DAT inhibitor that does not possess physiologically relevant levels of NET or SERT inhibition.
 
A growing body of literature indicates that inhibition of other catecholamine transporters, especially NET, exacerbate or even induce dyskinesias. In this way, all DAT inhibitors, other than MLR-1019, presumably have opposing effects towards therapeutic effect on PD-LID; on the one hand providing benefit vis-à-vis DAT inhibition and mitigating dopamine flux as discussed above, but on the other hand exacerbating dyskinesias vis-à-vis NET and possibly SERT inhibition. This recently developed understanding for the role of NET and SERT towards dyskinesia can explain the disappointing results that have been observed with a number of DAT inhibitors evaluated in PD clinical trials. These results also strongly predict that MLR-1019 will be differentiated from all other DAT inhibitors in the context of PD therapy.

Patent protection
 
MLR-1019 is protected by a total of 21 issued patents, 2 allowed patent applications, and 4 pending patent applications in the following territories: United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Luxemburg, Monaco, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea. Patent expiry is 2034.
 
Accelerated development pathway for MLR-1019
 
MLR-1019 is the active moiety of mesocarb, a product that was marketed in Russian and Eastern Europe for indications unrelated to PD for 37 years. The drug has strong safety and tolerability profiles following use in >1 million patients across a wide dosing range. In pre-clinical studies, MLR-1019 demonstrates robust attenuation of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (PD-LID) and potentiates the anti-Parkinsonian activity of L-DOPA. In addition, MLR-1019 stabilizes the disrupted sleep/wake cycles commonly associated with PD.
 
Manufacturing of MLR-1019 is underway in preparation for a Phase 2 multi-center clinical trial in 60 PD patients with L-DOPA induced dyskinesias, with the potential to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial within 24 months.
 
MLR-1023 in diabetes
 
MLR-1023 was originally developed by Pfizer and previously in clinical development for the treatment of gastric ulcers in the 1970s. Pfizer discontinued development of the drug, due to lack of efficacy (vs safety issues) for the primary indication (healing of gastric ulcers) in a phase 2 clinical trial.
 
The Company is developing MLR-1023 (tolimidone) for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes with additional potential indications for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and the prevention of pulmonary edema.
 
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes both occur when the body cannot properly store and use glucose, which is essential for energy. This glucose then collects in the blood and does not reach the cells that need it, leading to serious complications. Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are similar insofar as both share (similar) symptoms, including excessive thirst, increased urination, increased infections, fatigue, weight loss, and blurred vision. However, there are often differences in how rapidly symptoms first appear. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) usually appears first in children and adolescents, but it can also occur in adults. In T1D, the immune system attacks pancreatic beta cells so that they can no longer produce insulin. Around 5-10% of people with diabetes have Type 1. T1D seems to have a genetic component and can be diagnosed early in life but also in adulthood. Its causes are not fully known, and there is currently no cure. People with T1D are dependent on injected or pumped insulin to survive.
 
Type 2 diabetes is more likely to appear as people age, but children may still develop it. In this type, the pancreas produces insulin, but the body cannot use it effectively. Lifestyle factors appear to play a role in its development. The majority of people with diabetes have Type 2, although some 1.7 million people are living with Type 1.
 
Initially evaluated for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, MLR-1023 is pharmacologically and structurally different from metformin and sulfonylureas, drugs routinely used in clinical practice for the management of Type 2 diabetes and lowers blood glucose through a unique mechanism of action as a potent and selective inhibitor of lyn kinase (Lyn). Lyn is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, which is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, in neural tissues liver, and adipose tissue. MLR-1023 also demonstrates glycemic control via insulin sensitization in animal models of Type 2 diabetes. MLR-1023 does not affect PPARα, β, or γ-mediated transactivation, GLP-1-mediated insulin release, or DDP-IV activity. In studies conducted in in vivo models of Type 2 diabetes, MLR-1023 decreased blood glucose levels in mouse and rat oral glucose tolerance tests, in db/db mice and Zucker rats. Blood glucose lowering was produced with both acute and chronic dosing regimens. In addition, MLR-1023 produced efficacy with acute oral administration. In combination studies, MLR-1023 was additive with metformin in lowering blood glucose and blocked rosiglitazone-mediated weight gain in chronic dosing studies.

MLR-1023 and T1D
 
Most recently MLR-1023’s potential utility in T1D has been demonstrated by several studies including those conducted independently (of Adhera) at the University of Alberta, where Professor Jean Buteau confirmed lyn kinase (see also above) as a key factor for beta cell survival and proliferation. Importantly, MLR-1023 was able to induce proliferation in beta cells isolated from human cadavers and subsequent studies (at the University of Alberta) have demonstrated that the administration of MLR-1023 was able to induce a “cure” for T1D in animal models. From a mechanism of action perspective, MLR-1023 has been shown to both preserve beta cell degradation and to stimulate beta cell proliferation.
 
Accelerated development pathway for MLR-1023 in T1D
 
Commensurate with Adhera’s accelerated drug development strategy, The FDA has granted an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy of MLR-1023 in adult T1D patients. It is anticipated that this clinical trial can be completed in 6 months paving the way to the initiation of a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial in less than 24 months.
 
Rationale for MLR-1023 in the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and the prevention of pulmonary edema
 
Extensive preclinical data is highly supportive of the development of MLR-1023 for NASH and also the prevention of pulmonary edema. MLR-1023 reduced fibrosis in a CCl4 liver fibrosis model and reduced several symptoms of NASH in a modified high fat diet mouse model of NASH as well as in a NASH model involving modified high fat diet model with chronic low dose CCl4. When administered prophylactically, once per day (q.d.) for 7 days, MLR-1023 significantly mitigated the development of pulmonary edema in mice challenged with an inflammatory insult that modeled sepsis.
 
Patent Protection
 
MLR-1023 is protected by a total of 50 issued patents, 3 allowed patent applications, and 20 pending patent applications in the following territories: United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Luxemburg, Monaco, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea. Patent expiries range between 2026 and 2038 (with patent term adjustments).
 
As described below, the Company was previously a commercially focused entity that leveraged innovative distribution models and technologies to improve the quality of care for patients in the United States suffering from chronic and acute diseases with a focus on licensed fixed dose combination therapies for hypertension. On January 4, 2021, the licensor terminated the licensing agreement for the product candidate. As a result, we were left with several license agreements, none of which we are exploiting.
 
On July 28, 2021, we as licensee and MP2 entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of MLR-1019. MLR-1019 is being developed as a new class of therapeutic for PD and is, to the best of our knowledge, the only drug candidate today to address both movement and non-movement aspects of PD. Under the Agreement, we were granted an exclusive license to use MP’s patents and know-how related to MLR-1019 to develop products in consideration for cash payments upon meeting certain performance milestones as well as a royalty of 5% of gross sales.
 
On August 20, 2021, we as licensee entered into an exclusive license agreement regarding the development and commercialization of Melior’s MLR-1023 (the “MLR-1023 Agreement”) with Melior Pharmaceuticals I, Inc. (“MP1”). In this Annual Report, we refer to MP2 and MP1 as “MP” or “Melior”. This second license is for the development and commercialization of MLR-1023, which is being developed as a novel therapeutic for Type 1 diabetes.
 
On October 20, 2021, we as licensee expanded the exclusive MLR-1023 Agreement with MP1 to include two additional clinical indications, one for Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) and the other for pulmonary inflammation.
 
On November 17, 2021, Melior extended the Company’s timeline under the MLR-1023 Agreement from 120 days to 180 days from the effective of the MLR-1023 Agreement for the Company to raise $4 million unless, by 180 days Adhera is in the process of completing transactions to complete the fundraising, then an additional 30 days would be provided to allow for the completion of required fundraising. On February 16, 2022, an addendum to the MLR-1023 Agreement dated August 4, 2021 (the “First Addendum”), was executed by the Company and Melior, which extended the requirement by the Company to raise $4 million (the “Raise Requirement”) to June 16, 2022.

On July 18, 2022, the Company and Melior entered into the Second Addendum to the License Agreement (the “Second Addendum”). In accordance with the Second Addendum and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the Raise Requirement was extended to February 1, 2023. Pursuant to the Second Addendum, Melior has a right to terminate the MLR-1023 Agreement as a result of the Company’s inability to achieve certain milestones, including the requirement to:
 

(i) | raise $500,000 in working capital; 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | resume engagement with Davos Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Maladi Drugs & Pharmaceuticals such that the initial steps of MLR-1019 API manufacture were initiated; 
(iii) | pay Melior Pharma l, $136,921 as a license payment; 
(iv) | maintain the full-time employment of the Chief Scientific Officer who was hired pursuant to the First Addendum; 
(v) | continue to engage with Aegis Capital on activities aimed at providing an up-listing event; 
(vi) | for the duration of the MLR-1023 Agreement, Adhera will not in-license any additional assets other than those which it has already in-licensed (MLR-1023 and MLR-1019), except for the Taxeme compound (PGT) previously mentioned in the Second Addendum, however, no funds will be expended on discovery or development of the Taxeme compound during this period; and 
(vii) | fulfill the Raise Requirement defined in the MLR-1023 Agreement which was extended to February 1, 2023. 

 
As of February 1, 2023, the Company had not raised the additional $500,000 of capital, commenced API manufacturing, nor completed the Raise Requirement as defined in the MLR-1023 Agreement. In March 2023, the Company obtained a verbal agreement with Melior to extend the terms of the MLR-1023 Agreement until such time that the milestones have been met, including payment of the maintenance costs of the MLR-1023 patent. However, Melior may terminate the license of MLR-1023 at any time due to non-performance of continuing license obligations with a 60-day required notice to cure non-performance. Any termination or loss of use of MLR-1023 would have a material adverse effect on our business, which would likely result in the Company discontinuing all operations and seeking bankruptcy protection.
 
To the extent that resources have been available, we have continued to work with our advisors in an effort to restructure our Company and to identify potential strategic transactions, including the Melior transactions described above, to enhance the value of the Company. However, because of our substantial unpaid debt, if we do not raise additional capital in the immediate future, we might not have sufficient funds available to meet our obligations and it is likely that this would also result in the Company discontinuing all operations and seek bankruptcy protection.
 
The milestones, payment obligations and other material terms under the foregoing license agreements with Melior are qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the agreements, each of which are provided as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


Corporate History
 
Adhera was incorporated under Delaware law under the name Nastech Pharmaceutical Company on September 23, 1983.
 
On November 15, 2016, Adhera entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with IThenaPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ithena”), IThena Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of IThena (“Merger Sub”), and a representative of the stockholders of IThena (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into IThena, with IThena surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adhera (such transaction, the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the former holders of IThena common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger owned approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of Adhera common stock immediately following the completion of the Merger.
 
IThena was incorporated under Delaware law on September 3, 2014. IThena is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger, and thus the historical financial statements of IThena will be treated as the historical financial statements of our company and will be reflected in our quarterly and annual reports for periods ending after the effective time of the Merger. Accordingly, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we started to report the results of IThena and Adhera and their respective subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
 
Subsequent to the Merger, we acquired the rights to commercialize Prestalia, an anti-hypertensive drug approved by the FDA from Symplmed Pharmaceuticals LLC in June 2017 pursuant to a license agreement. We marketed Prestalia in the U.S. from June 2018 until December 2019. The license agreement together with all rights to future commercialization activities with respect to the product was terminated in January 2021.
 
Partnering and Licensing Agreements
 
Melior
 
As described above, the Company has acquired licenses to develop and commercialize certain products owned by Melior. The below table summarizes the milestones and payment obligations under each such license agreement.

Under the license, the Company also agreed to royalty payments of 5% of gross sales if the product is commercialized. The MLR-1019 license terminates upon the last expiration of the patents licensed by the Company, which is presently 2034 subject extensions and renewals of any of such patents. If the Company fails to have its common stock listed on Nasdaq or the NYSE within 12 months after the Company receives a Clinical Trial Authorization from the European Medicines Agency, then the Company’s commercial license and rights to MLR-1019 under the license agreement will terminate.
 
MLR-1023:
 
Under the MLR-1023 license, we agreed to make the following milestone payments if the applicable milestone is reached:
 

Milestone | Milestone Payment | 
----------------------------------------------+-------------------+-----------
Last patient enrolled into the Phase 2a study | $ | 250,000 
Positive outcome of the Phase 2a study | $ | 1,500,000 
Initiation of a Phase 3 study | $ | 10,000,000
New Drug Application approval | $ | 10,000,000
Total Milestone Payments | $ | 21,750,000

 
The agreement also included royalty payments upon commercialization of the product as follows: (i) 8% of future gross product sales, applicable to the first $400,000,000 of gross product sales; (ii) 10% of future gross product sales, applicable to sales after $400,000,000 and up to $800,000,000; and (iii) 12% of future gross product sales applicable to sales after $800,000,000.


Proprietary Rights and Intellectual Property
 
We have relied primarily on patents and contractual rights and obligations with third parties to protect our proprietary rights and further our operational objectives. We have sought, and, to the extent that we continue our business operations, intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. To date, the U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications that we have filed, and the patents that have been granted to us, relate to our legacy intranasal and RNA interference programs. As noted elsewhere in this Prospectus, we are in the process of evaluating the path forward for such programs, including seeking options to continue certain programs or to divest assets. There can be no assurance that any of our patents will be guaranteed protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates, and to the extent that we do not properly maintain (including paying any required fees) such patents, it is possible that any protection provided to us will be impaired or lost altogether.

We also use license agreements both to access external intellectual property rights and technologies and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. To the extent that we continue our business operations, our financial success will be dependent in part on our ability to obtain (and maintain) commercially valuable patent claims and to protect our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others.
 
Further, we have purchase rights for the Licensed Products including the patents and related intellectual property from Melior with respect to the following product candidates:
 

● | MRL 1019 (Patent No. 10,188,651) for the treatment of PD; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | MRL 1023 (Patent No. 11,033,548) for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes, NASH and pulmonary inflation. 

Research and Development
 
On July 28, 2021, we as licensee and MP2 as licensor, entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development, commercialization, and exclusive license of MLR-1019. MLR-1019 is being developed as a new class of therapeutics for PD and is, to the best of our knowledge, the only drug candidate today with the potential to address both movement and non-movement aspects of PD.
 
On August 20, 2021, we as licensee entered into the MLR-1023 Agreement for the exclusive license regarding the development and commercialization of Melior’s MLR-1023. This second license is for the development and commercialization of MLR-1023, which is being developed as a novel therapeutic for Type 1 diabetes.


On October 20, 2021, we as licensee expanded the MLR-1023 Agreement with MP1 to include two additional clinical indications for Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) and pulmonary inflammation.


On July 20, 2022, the Company and Melior entered into the Second Addendum. In accordance with the Second Addendum and subject to the terms and conditions therein, the Raise Requirement was extended to February 1, 2023, in exchange for a $136,921 licensing payment that was made by the Company on July 28, 2022. In addition, the Company was required to hire and retain a Chief Scientific Officer, and raise an additional $500,000 in capital in addition to other requirements set forth in the Second Addendum and MLR-1023 Agreement.
 
As of February 1, 2023, the Company had not raised the additional $500,000 of capital, commenced API manufacturing, nor completed the Raise Requirement as defined in the MLR-1023 Agreement. In March 2023, the Company obtained a verbal agreement with Melior to extend the terms of the MLR-1023 Agreement until such time that the milestones have been met and the Company pays outstanding patent maintenance costs. However, Melior may terminate the license of MLR-1023 at any time due to non-performance of continuing license obligations with a 60-day required notice to cure non-performance.


During the latter part of 2021 and the year 2022, we have been actively engaged in early development activities relating to MLR-1019 and MLR-1023 alongside our licensing partner, CRO’s, and patent counsel. In this regard, we have continued to conduct scientific experiments to expand potential clinical indications and file, prosecute, and maintain patents potentially enforceable in the USA and multiple overseas territories.
 
The drug development process requires ongoing dialogue with the FDA, including the submission of any new drug data. During 2022, the company has maintained an active Investigational New Drug (IND) application required to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of MLR-1023 in Type 1 diabetes. We have also developed a protocol for this clinical trial in conjunction with our licensing partner and the Global Contract Clinical Research Organization, PPD. The multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial seeks to evaluate the efficacy of MLR-1023 in 45 adult patients with established Type 1 diabetes. Most recently, in 2022 and in collaboration with the Alberta Diabetes Institute, we have developed a protocol for the initiation of a single center study of MLR-1023 in Type 1 diabetes patients.
 
The conduct of clinical trials (or the planned conduct of clinical trials) requires that clinical trial supplies are tested on an ongoing basis for stability. These studies have been conducted by Frontage Laboratories (PA) on behalf of the company.
 
In regard to MLR-1019, our drug candidate for PD, we have similarly developed a clinical protocol for the evaluation of MLR-1019 in up to 60 patients with Parkinson’s disease and managed issues arising from clinical supply manufacture, and regulatory considerations arising from these ongoing studies.
 
We have been also collaborating with two major pharmaceutical companies with a view to out-licensing certain rights to MLR-1019 in Europe, China, and potentially in the USA.
 
The direction and supervision of these activities necessitated the hire of a Chief Scientific Officer (Dr. Zahed Subhan) with both familiarity with the both MLR-1019 and MLR-1023, and expertise in drug discovery, development, and commercialization.

Facilities
 
We do not own or lease any real property or facilities. If we advance our business operations, we may seek to lease facilities of our own in order to support our operational and administrative needs. There can be no assurance that such facilities will be available, or that they will be available on suitable terms. Our inability to obtain such facilities could have a material adverse effect on our future plans and operations.
Corporate History
 
Adhera was incorporated under Delaware law under the name Nastech Pharmaceutical Company on September 23, 1983.
 
On November 15, 2016, Adhera entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with IThenaPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“IThena”), IThena Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of IThena (“Merger Sub”), and a representative of the stockholders of IThena (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into IThena, with IThena surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adhera (such transaction, the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the former holders of IThena common stock immediately prior to the completion of the Merger owned approximately 65% of the issued and outstanding shares of Adhera common stock immediately following the completion of the Merger.
 
IThena was incorporated under Delaware law on September 3, 2014. IThena was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the Merger, and thus the historical financial statements of IThena will be treated as the historical financial statements of our company and will be reflected in our quarterly and annual reports for periods ending after the effective time of the Merger. Accordingly, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we started to report the results of IThena and Adhera and their respective subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
 
Subsequent to the Merger, we acquired the rights to commercialize Prestalia, an anti-hypertensive drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) from Symplmed Pharmaceuticals LLC in June 2017 pursuant to a license agreement with Les Laboratories, Servier, a French pharmaceutical conglomerate . We marketed Prestalia in the U.S. from June 2018 until December 2019. The license agreement with Les Laboratories, Servier together with all rights to future commercialization activities with respect to the product was terminated in January 2021.
 
Need for Future Financing
 
We will require substantial additional funds on an immediate basis to continue our business operations. We have in the past raised additional capital to supplement our commercialization, clinical and pre-clinical development and operational expenses through the issuance of common stock, indebtedness including promissory notes and convertible notes, and other derivative securities which have a dilutive effect on existing stockholders. We will need to raise additional funds through equity financing, debt financing, strategic alliances, or other sources, which may result in significant further dilution in the equity ownership of our shares or result in further encumbrances being placed on our assets. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or that it will be sufficient for us to successfully engage in any of our planned business operations, including re-starting the drug development and discovery programs relating to our legacy RNA interference assets and furthering the research and development efforts with respect to product candidates under our license from Melior. If we are not able to obtain additional financing on a timely basis as required or generate significant capital from the out-licensing and/or divestiture of existing assets, we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due and will be forced to scale down or even cease our operations altogether.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we have $1.7 million of convertible notes including approximately $424,000 in accrued interest outstanding. All of the convertible notes including accrued interest are currently in default. In addition, we have $8.0 million of non-convertible notes and approximately $3.0 of accrued interest outstanding with approximately $5.7 million of principal and $2.9 million of interest in default.
 
On November 16, 2022, holders of approximately $5.7 million of principal on outstanding promissory notes that were in default agreed to amend the Notes to make them automatically convertible into units consisting of a new series of convertible preferred stock and warrants upon an up-listing financing transaction in which the Company’s common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market or the NYSE American, in exchange for the Holders agreeing to forbear repayment of their Notes and accrued interest until the up-listing transaction has been completed.

The terms for the amendment of the Notes include no less than the following:
 

● | The Notes will automatically convert upon the Uplisting Transaction into the Preferred Stock at 90% of the public offering price; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In addition, each Holder will receive 0.3 Warrants for every $1.00 of principal on the Holder’s original Note; 
● | The shares of Preferred Stock will be subject to a six-month lock-up period from date of issuance; and 
● | The Company has agreed to register the Holders’ sale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and upon the exercise of the Warrants such that those shares will be freely tradeable following the Uplisting Transaction and expiration of the lock-up period. 

 
The interest on the Notes, as accrued through the date of conversion, will convert into common stock at the offering price for the Up-listing Transaction.
 
We can provide no assurance that the Company will be able to complete an up-list transaction per the amended terms of the notes or be able to raise additional funding to repay the notes.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We terminated our commercial activities related to Prestalia in December 2019, and the license agreement was subsequently terminated by the licensor in January 2021. Our activities in 2021, were primarily related to inventory storage and destruction for Prestalia.
Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of any products and product candidates that we may develop or acquire, to the extent that we may continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, are their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge and experience provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major and minor pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many of these competitors have greater for capital resources and access to capital than we do, and personnel with more industry experience and scientific background than those we utilize. Our products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and/or acquire, and later commercialize, will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
We anticipate that many of the companies against which we may compete in the future will have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, product acquisition, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete, or may compete, with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and products complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.

The commercial opportunity for any product candidates that we may acquire and/or develop could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs or therapies that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may acquire or develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. See “Risk Factors” for more information on the risks we face with respect to our competition.
 
To date, we have not fully developed, received regulatory approval for or commercialized any of our current product candidates. Our ability to compete will depend, to a great extent, on the speed in which we and our collaborators can develop safe and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing and regulatory approval processes, and coordinate with third parties to produce and distribute the resulting products in sufficient commercial quantities to create and maintain a market for such products at favorable costs and prices. If we do complete development of and obtain regulatory approval to market any product candidate, we anticipate that the competition we would face with respect to such product would be based on a combination of a number of factors including efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other factors.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drugs and pharmaceutical products. To the extent that we continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, of which there can be no assurance, all of the products that we anticipate seeking to develop and/or commercialize are expected to be regulated as drug products.
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and other laws within the Public Health Service Act. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecutions. Before any drug products that we may develop and/or acquire are marketed, they must be approved by the FDA. The steps required before a drug product is approved by the FDA include: (1) pre-clinical laboratory, animal, and formulation tests; (2) submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; (3) adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product for each indication for which approval is sought; (4) submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); (5) satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and FDA review; and finally (6) approval of an NDA.
 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions, such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. There can be no assurance that submission of an IND will result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. Once an IND is in effect, each clinical trial to be conducted under the IND must be submitted to the FDA, which may or may not allow the trial to proceed.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified physician-investigators and healthcare personnel. Clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 usually involves the initial administration of the investigational drug or biologic product to healthy individuals to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance and pharmacodynamics. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population, with the disease or condition for which the test material is being developed, to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks; and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the drug or biologic candidate in its final form in an expanded patient population. To the extent that we engage in any clinical studies, our product development partners, the FDA, or we may suspend clinical trials, if any, at any time on various grounds, including any situation where we or our partners believe that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or are obtaining no medical benefit from the test material.

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical trials and the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an application, the FDA will usually inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA determines the NDA is not acceptable, the FDA may outline the deficiencies in the NDA and often will request additional information. If the FDA approves the NDA, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be sure that any approval of any products that we develop and/or acquire will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to CEQ508 for the treatment of FAP in December 2010. We are evaluating the best path forward to re-start development activities regarding CEQ508, and evaluating options for our other programs relating to RNA interference.
 
In addition, regardless of the type of approval, to the extent that we continue to engage in the biopharmaceutical industry, we and our partners will be required to comply with a number of FDA requirements both before and after approval with respect to any products that we may develop, acquire or commercialize. For example, we and our partners will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including production and quality control to comply with cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market.
 
In addition to FDA regulations for the marketing of pharmaceutical products, there are various other state and federal laws that may restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These include the following:
 

● | The federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback laws, which prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, or furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions and policies that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment; 
● | The federal False Claims Act which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government; 


-14-
----


● | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits certain payments made to foreign government officials; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | State and foreign law equivalents of the foregoing and state laws regarding pharmaceutical company marketing compliance, reporting and disclosure obligations; 
● | The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which among other things changes access to healthcare products and services; creates new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries; changes rebates and prices for health care products and services; and requires additional reporting and disclosure; and 
● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which imposes requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and requires notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information; 

 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
If we bring a product candidate to clinical trial, we may undertake to commence such a trial in a foreign jurisdiction, in which case we and third parties on which we rely would be subject to such foreign government’s laws and regulations pertaining to the research and development, including clinical testing on human subjects, of therapeutic product candidates. Further, to the extent that any of the products that we develop and/or acquire are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. None of our products were ever developed or sold outside the United States.
