Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Capstone Companies, Inc. (“Company” or “CAPC”) is a public holding company, that on March 25, 2004, organized under the laws of the State of Florida. The Company is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of consumer inspired products that simplify daily living through technology. Over the past decade, the Company’s various product lines have been distributed globally including consumer markets in Australia, Japan, Korea, North America, South America, and the United Kingdom. The primary operating subsidiary is Capstone Industries, Inc. (“Capstone”), a Florida corporation located at the principal executive offices of the Company. Capstone International Hong Kong, Ltd., or “CIHK”, was established to expand the Company’s product development, engineering, and factory resource capabilities. With the 2021 shift of manufacturing to Thailand from China, the CIHK operation was downsized and put in dormant status in March 2022.
 
The Company’s focus through 2017 was the integration of LEDs into most commonly used consumer lighting products in today’s home. Over the last few years there has been significant LED price erosion, which has commoditized LED consumer products. The LED category has matured and is no longer the innovative “must have” consumer product as in previous years, as such, revenues for the LED product line have declined significantly in 2022. The Connected Surfaces is the Company’s effort to establish business in an emerging segment that is intended for future revenue growth. The smart home segment is the umbrella category in which we intend to participate with the Connected Surfaces program.
 
In late 2017, as management recognized that the LED category was maturing, it sought a business opportunity that would transition the Company’s revenue streams to an emerging new product category. While we currently continue to supply LED products on a limited basis, our strategic plan to develop and launch new innovative product lines, like Connected Surfaces’ Smart Mirrors, is believed to be essential for sustaining or growing revenues. However, we were unable to establish the Connected Surfaces’ Smart Mirrors as a product line to replace the LED product line and provide revenues sufficient to fully fund Company operations and overhead. The Smart Mirror product line continues to have limited sales in the first three months of 2023.
 
The Company began its foray into the electronics industry in 2019 with its Connected Surfaces initiative. We decided to enter the market as we identified the smart home category to be emerging with strong long-term growth potential. The Connected Surfaces portfolio is designed to tap into consumer’s ever-expanding Internet of Things, wireless connected lifestyles prevalent today. The Smart Mirrors have both touch and remote control interfacing and it’s casting capabilities offer voice control through one’s smartphone. Full access to the internet and an operating system capable of running downloadable applications makes the smart mirror customizable to one’s usage preferences. The average selling prices are comparable to that of tablets and smartphones, retailing between $799 - $999 per unit, with the goal to deliver cost-attractive products and consumer value to mainstream America. Whereas, during the day your smartphone/tablet keeps you connected, whether it is work or personal, now when entering your home, Capstone’s new Connected Surfaces products are intended to enable users the same level of connectivity in a more relaxed manner that does not require being tethered to these devices.

The Company will require third party funding to cover operating overhead and to resume efforts to fund its marketing   and product launch campaigns. The future growth will be directly impacted by the level of exposure, messaging and distribution capabilities. Certain members of the Company’s management (“Corporate Insiders and Directors”) have provided short-term funding from time to time to support the Company’s basic operational funding needs, but there is no guarantee that this funding will continue or be adequate to fund operations or Connected Surfaces program marketing and inventory as well as possible enhancements in functions demanded by the consumers. The Company will require third party funding to sustain basic operations and continue efforts to market the Connected Surfaces’ Smart Mirror product line.
 
The Company has historically competed in highly competitive consumer market channels that can be affected by volatility from a number of general business and economic factors such as, consumer confidence, employment levels, credit availability, commodity costs and the recovery from the global pandemic. As stated earlier, and based on historical trends, the markets for LED home products have matured and growth within the category will continue to decline as markets are saturated. For these reasons, our focus is directed to the expansion and advancement of the Company’s Connected Surfaces initiative. As planned, in 2022 we began to exit the LED industry. Connected Surfaces Smart Mirrors program is intended to replace the LED product lines as the Company’s primary business line and its success is critical to the Company’s business and financial performance in the future. 
 By working overseas with alternate manufacturers located outside China, particularly in Thailand, we anticipated minimal impact to our selling prices and related margins of profit that could otherwise be impacted by an ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China. Political unrest in Thailand in late 2020 and early 2021 did not affect our original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) activities, however the transportation/logistics costs have escalated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we are beginning to see more stability as we are able to book freight without the surcharges imposed by container shortages experienced during 2021 and 2022.
 
While the Company announced the plan to launch its ecommerce initiative in March 2021, that effort was continually delayed because the COVID-19 pandemic forced factory closures overseas and inventories planned for Q3 2021 sales were shipped in December 2021, which pushed the formal product launch into January 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic and transitioning to Thailand OEM’s as well as to be expected delays in developing an acceptable new product essentially delayed our launch of the Smart Mirror product line by a year into 2022, which combined with declining LED product sales, has adversely impacted the Company’s business and financial performance. The initial inventory that arrived in our fulfilment center in the United States at the end of Q4 2021 was damaged by the logistics company. We filed an insurance claim and were compensated for the damaged inventory during 2022, however, incurred significant delays in our initial Smart Mirror product launch.
 
Beginning in 2020, the Company substantially expanded its investment and commitment to social media marketing year over year. The Company was disappointed with the 2022 results of the e-commerce efforts equating to high customer acquisition costs for a low level of sales. Since the Company was new to e-commerce and social media marketing, the cost of developing an effective e-commerce program and social media marketing was greater than anticipated by the Company.
 
The Company oversees and controls the manufacturing of its products, which are currently made in Thailand and China by OEM contract manufacturers. To support the e-commerce model for 2022, we transitioned inventories into warehouse facilities stateside for direct-to-consumer fulfillment. When introducing the Connected Surfaces program to Big Box retailers as planned in the first half of 2023, the Company will resume its direct import model. At that time, the Company’s products will be built to order for specific promotional periods and will not require replenishment domestically.
 
As of today, all of the Company’s retail sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. As such, the nature of the Company’s business did not provide visibility of material forward-looking information from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months.
 
The Company started to actively market and sell the Smart Mirror product line in March 2022, which is the first introduction within the Capstone Connected Surfaces program. The initial marketing launch was at the Consumer Electronics Show in early 2020 but its release to the retail market was delayed due to product development delays at our suppliers and other related approval and certification delays resulting from the impact of COVID-19, which impact was mainly limitations on staff work and staffing causing delays in completion of work and backlogs in work at suppliers and certification or regulatory organizations. The Company commenced production after a long awaited FCC approval. This review process, which historically has taken 4-5 weeks, was delayed continuously and was finalized after 5 months of delays. These are not unfamiliar steps to management, as all our products are subject to

most of the same approval processes; however, we do not control the speed at which the testing companies advance. and as a result of the pandemic and shift to decentralized operations the delays were unforeseen. Our first 1,000 Smart Mirrors were shipped and arrived in January 2022 at our fulfillment center. These inventories were originally expected in Q2 2021. We air-freighted initial inventories to the U.S. so that we could activate our e-commerce program and fulfill orders immediately. The inventories were partially damaged in transit causing a 30 day delay on the contracted receipt date. The full 1,000 Smart Mirror inventory was available for e-commerce sales in March 2022.
 
Our business operations and financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2022 were significantly and adversely impacted by the long term impacts of the global pandemic as well as our shortage of e-commerce industry expertise. When the global pandemic restrictions gradually lifted during 2022, the consumer’s buying habits had been altered. After stocking up on home goods, home improvements and electronics during the stay at home orders, once those orders were lifted, consumers chose to spend their money on things to do versus things to have. This change in consumer spending on activities versus goods negatively impacted the 2022 launch of the Smart Mirror significantly. Sales of the Smart Mirror severely underperformed management’s expectations, generating approximately $74,000 in net sales for an approximate 105 units sold. In addition to the change in consumer spending, the Company changed its marketing course in late 2021 and 2022 by moving away from the Big Box retailers and put all of its marketing effort into the e-commerce marketing industry. The Company’s first parlay into e-commerce proved to be very costly and a difficult market to secure customer acquisition with the Company spending approximately $285,000 in 2022 on social media, advertising and trade shows, and increase of $260,000 over the prior year. The Company has decided to re-focus their marketing strategy in 2023 and move back to brick and mortar and Big Box retailers, which was their core strength with the Lighting Products and which they feel they could replicate with the Connected Surfaces product lines. Management has spent Q1 2023 actively marketing the Connected Surfaces product lines to brick-and-mortar retailers while maintaining their e-commerce presence. As of the date of this filing of the Form 10-K, we have not produced any orders from Big Box retailers and there can be no assurance that it will succeed in establishing a revenue stream that is able to sustain the Company’s operations.


Our Growth Strategy
 
The Company’s looking forward strategy requires continued expansion of its product development and engineering, manufacturing base marketing and distribution of a broadened portfolio of consumer electronic products. Subject to adequate funding and cash flow from Smart Mirrors product line, the Company will pursue new revenue opportunities through the introduction and expansion of its “Connected Surfaces” portfolio into alternate distribution channels including e-commerce and others that the Company has not previously focused on. The Company also intends to leverage its existing valuable customer base and strong relationships to achieve organic growth initiatives within this new category. These efforts will depend on having adequate working capital from funding and cash flow from product sales. We have not achieved such adequate funding as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K and we may be unable to achieve sufficient working capital when and, in the amounts, required to meet operational needs and overhead. The lack of adequate, timely and affordable funding may undermine the efforts of. the Company to establish a revenue stream from the Smart Mirrors product line and efforts to sustain Company operations.


The Company competes in competitive consumer market channels that can be affected by volatility from a number of general business and economic factors such as, consumer confidence, employment levels, credit availability and commodity costs. Demand for the Company’s products is highly dependent on economic drivers such as consumer spending and discretionary income. Since the Company produces products, both LED lighting and Smart Mirrors, that are discretionary purchases of consumers and not necessities, general and regional economic conditions affect consumer confidence which in turn usually affects the willingness of consumers to purchase Company products. The Company has been unable to sell any significant number of Smart Mirrors in 2022 and the lack of sales has continued into the first fiscal quarter of 2023.
 
While COVID-19 pandemic spikes have impacted full functioning of overseas factories, which delayed shipments of Smart Mirrors, the Company has been unable to sell its available inventory of Smart Mirrors as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K and that inability may reflect that the Smart Mirrors are not matching consumer preferences. While increased marketing may improve sales of Smart Mirrors, there can be no assurance that the Company can afford an extended, expanded marketing campaign or that an extended, expanded marketing campaign would significantly increase sales or consumer demand for Smart Mirrors.

Organic Growth Strategy
 
Subject to adequate funding and favorable cash flow from Connected Surfaces products, which has not been achieved, the Company intends to pursue various initiatives to execute its organic growth strategy, which is designed to enhance its market presence, expand its customer base and maintain its recognition as an industry leader in new product development. Key elements of our organic growth strategy include:


Connected Surfaces. Historically, LED lighting products have been our core business. The Capstone Lighting and Hoover Home LED brands, combined, have sold millions of LED lighting products over the recent years and consequently the Company holds a well-respected position in the retail lighting category. While consistently launching successful lighting programs, the Company determined that it needed to develop a new product line with greater profit margin potential than LED Lighting. The Company has refocused its development and marketing initiatives and is focused on developing the Connected Surfaces products as its primary business line to replace the LED lighting business, which is no longer being actively promoted by the Company due to gross margin reductions as a result of increased tariffs and declining consumer interest. The Company’s product roadmap outlines the plan for an additional product launch in 2023, branded Connected Chef, a kitchen utility item, and this will continue to expand as consumer product acceptance validates its innovations. The Company believes this program will leverage existing relationships with its current retail partners and collectively contribute organic growth for the Company. The ability of the Company to promote any of its Connected Surface products will depend on securing adequate, affordable and timely funding from lenders and investors. As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-K, the Company has not secured that funding, however a director/officer has been providing interim financing while other financing options are being considered.
 
The Company anticipates that smart homes will become more mainstream over the next several years based on increasing developments of smart home technologies and products and consumer purchases of smart home technologies and products and will present a significant, potential growth opportunity for the Company and its Connected Surfaces portfolio. While our Connected Surface products is aimed at the smart home market, we are also targeting the medical industry for a Smart Mirror to assist with the growing digital health services including but not limited to physical therapy, dermatology uses and home health care.
 
Perceived or Essential Strengths
 
Our Chief Executive Officer’s experience in hardline product manufacturing has prepared the Company for successful entries into various consumer product markets, especially its experience in using foreign OEMs to provide capabilities not possessed internally by our company.
Product Quality: Through a combination of sourcing quality components, stringent manufacturing quality control and conducting rigorous third-party testing, product quality has been a priority of the Company and essential to competing in competitive markets. To deliver cost-competitive products without compromising quality standards, we leverage purchasing volume and capitalize on strategic vendor relationships. This advantage has not been realized in 2022 with respect to the Smart Mirrors due to perceived changes in purchasing habits of consumers and resulting changes in buying habits of Company’s core retailer customer base.

Perceived Weaknesses
 
The Company does not possess the business, marketing, and financial resources of larger competitors or the brand recognition or international markets of some of the larger competitors. The declining financial performance of the Company due to discontinuation of the LED lighting product line has placed the Company in a weakened financial position, which in turn increases the need for working capital funding from investors or lenders. The Company lacks the hard assets for affordable, sufficient debt financing and the low market price of its Common Stock makes equity funding difficult in terms of finding suitable investors who will provide adequate, affordable, timely working capital funding.
 
The product launch of the Smart Mirrors did not meet projected sales forecasts for 2022. Customer acquisition costs of the e-commerce marketplace were high while producing low conversion into sales. In addition, the consumer’s buying habits were altered during the global pandemic. After stocking up on home goods, home improvements and electronics during the stay at home orders, once those orders were lifted, consumers chose to spend their money on things to do versus things to have. This change in consumer spending on activities versus goods negatively impacted the 2022 launch of the Smart Mirror significantly.


The plan to expand the Company’s product portfolio through Connected Surfaces involves the inherent risk of increased operating and marketing costs without a corresponding increase in operational revenues and profits. Expense categories including molds, prototyping, engineering, advertising, public relations, tradeshows and social media platforms will continue to be incurred for a period before revenues occur.
 
The Company does not have the large internal research and development capability of its larger competitors. Capstone operates with a limited number of employees whose functions are dedicated to executive management, sales and marketing or administrative support. The limited number of employees may hinder or delay the ability of the Company to identify or respond to consumer preferences or new technology developments in a product line. Hiring may be required with any growth and qualified personnel may not be readily available. We cannot match the compensation packages to prospective employees that many larger competitors may offer, and we lack the funding and other resources to change our operational model and its reliance on contractors for many functions and capabilities, including development, production, shipping, warehousing and distribution of products.
 
As a smaller reporting company, we are more vulnerable to events like COVID-19 pandemic, production and shipping delays, travel and operational disruptions and restrictions and an accelerated shift to e-commerce from reliance on brick-and-mortar retail sales. We lack the staff, money, internal capabilities and resources and operational experience to significantly or timely respond to significant challenges and adverse changes in business and financial requirements.
 
COVID-19 pandemic closures of companies and shipping-distribution channels produced a delay in shipping and receipt of products from abroad and in the United States. The problems include a lack of sufficient drivers for the trucking industry. The Company relies on OEM’s located in Thailand and China, which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in meeting development, production and shipping deadlines. The extent of the continuing economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting logistical delays is uncertain as of the date of this Form 10-K report.
 
Capstone’s international purchases can become more expensive if the U.S. Dollar weakens against the foreign currencies. Should the increased U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese manufactured goods remain it may increase the cost of electronic components used in our products.
 
While we have established new production capacity in Thailand, there is no final resolution of the U.S. / China trade dispute from which specific components are sourced. Developing a new, efficient OEM relationship in a new country takes time and effort to reach acceptable production efficiencies. We have only a short operational experience with Thai OEM’s and cannot predict long term effectiveness of the relationship.

The financial condition of the Company has included seeking a significant corporate transaction, including, without limitation, a possible merger and acquisition transaction or reorganization to sustain operations or to acquire a new business line that can support company operations. Like many companies, the Company conducts periodic strategic reviews where the feasibility of significant corporate transactions are considered, including mergers, asset purchases or sales and diversification or change in business lines. The Company lacks the financial resources of larger companies to withstand adverse, significant and sustained changes in business and financial condition. This vulnerability necessitates an ongoing consideration of alternatives to current operations. Due to the decline in financial performance of the Company since 2021, and the Company being in transition from a declining product line and not yet establishing a profitable product line, as well as the Company having its shares of Common Stock quoted on The OTC Markets Group, Inc. QB Venture Market, the Company may be unable to consummate a corporate transaction that sustains operations.
 
Products and Customers
 
While the Company is expanding its product portfolio through the introduction of the Capstone Connected Surfaces program, it still maintains a select number of LED lighting products under the “Capstone Lighting®” brand available through Amazon and Wayfair e-commerce websites.
 
The product lines available as of the date of this Form 10-K report are as follows:
 
Connected Surfaces – Smart Mirrors:
 Standard Rectangular
 Wardrobe/Fitness Mirror
 LED Lighting : Discontinued in 2023
 
The plan to expand the Company’s product portfolio through Connected Surfaces involves the inherent risk of increased operating and marketing costs without a corresponding increase in operational revenues and profits. Expense categories including molds, prototyping, engineering, advertising, public relations, tradeshows and social media platforms will continue to be incurred before shipments and related revenues occur. Promotion of the Connected Surfaces product line was hampered in 2022 by the lack of adequate, long-term funding and declining revenues from product sales.


Over the past ten years, the Company has established product distribution relationships with numerous leading international, national and regional retailers, including but not limited to: Amazon, Costco Wholesale, Sam’s Club-Walmart, the Container Store and Firefly Buys. These distribution channels may sell the Company’s products through the internet as well as through retail storefronts and catalogs/mail order. The Company believes it has developed the scale, manufacturing efficiencies, and design expertise that serves as the foundation for aggressive pursuit of niche product opportunities in our largest consumer domestic and international markets. While Capstone has traditionally generated the majority of its sales in the U.S. market, urbanization, rising family incomes and increased living standards abroad have spurred a perceived demand for small consumer appliances internationally. To capture this market opportunity, the Company has continued its international sales by leveraging relationships with our existing global retailers and by strengthening our international product offerings. The Company sold Capstone brand LED products to markets outside the U.S., including Australia, Japan, and South Korea. International sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $45 thousand or 13% of net revenue as compared to $341 thousand or 50% in fiscal 2021. The Company’s performance depends on a number of assumptions and factors. Critical to growth are the economic conditions in the markets that we serve, as well as success in the Company’s initiatives to distinguish its brands from competitors by design, quality, and scope of functions and new technology or features. Efforts to expand into new international markets may be adversely impacted in the near term by COVID-19 pandemic.
 
The Company’s products are subject to general economic conditions that impact discretionary consumer spending on non-essential items. Such continued progress depends on a number of assumptions and factors, including ones mentioned in “Risk Factors” below. Critical to growth are economic conditions in the markets that foster greater consumer spending as well as success in the Company’s initiatives to distinguish its brands from competitors by design, quality, and scope of functions and new technology or features. The Company’s ability to fund the pursuit of our goals remains a constant, significant factor.

Tariffs. The previous U.S. administration implemented certain tariffs that directly affected the Company’s competitiveness. While all companies in certain industries are affected equally, the appeal for these products to consumers was negatively impacted when retail prices increased due to higher duty rates. The Company has seen promotional schedules cut back and retailers have requested pricing adjustments that would not be known to them in advance to products being shipped. Capstone’s previous business model insulates the Company from paying duties as its retail partners are the importers of record. The obvious unknown is the final impact of tariffs to the landed costs. Accordingly, retailers have demonstrated caution in their promotional planning schedules and will continue to do so until the administration has clarified its position enabling importers to calculate estimated landed costs.
 
Tariffs and trade restrictions imposed by the previous U.S. administration provoked trade and tariff retaliation by other countries. A “trade dispute” of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses. As of the date of this Report, the new U.S. administration is currently reviewing its future position on this issue and there has not been a resolution of the Chinese-American trade dispute.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We use direct sales by our Chief Executive Officer and sales agents to sell our products, which effort includes direct sales to Big Box retailers.
 
Our sales within the U.S. are primarily made by our in-house sales team and our independent sales agencies. Our independent sales agencies are paid a commission based upon sales made in their respective territories. Our sales agencies are recruited, trained and monitored by us directly. We will utilize an agency as needed to help us provide service to our retail customers as required. The sales agency agreements are generally one (1) year agreements, which automatically renew on an annual basis, unless terminated by either party on 30 days’ prior notice. Our international sales to divisions of U.S. based retailers are made by our in-house sales team.
 
The Company has historically promoted its products to retailers and distributors at North American trade shows, such as the Consumer Electronics Show (“CES”) or the International Hardware Show, but also relies on the retail sales channels to advertise its products directly to the end user consumers through various promotional activities. Subject to adequate working capital, this marketing effort will continue as a complement to the social media and e-commerce initiatives.
 
Direct Import Sales. We currently ship finished products directly to our retail customer from Thailand and China. The sales transaction and title of goods are completed by delivering products to the customers overseas shipping point. The customer takes title of the goods at that point and is responsible for inbound ocean freight and import duties. Direct import sales are made in larger quantities (generally container sized lots) to customers worldwide.
Domestic Sales. The strategy of selling products from a U.S. domestic warehouse enables the Company to provide timely delivery and serve as a domestic supplier of imported goods. With this model the Company imports goods from overseas and is responsible for all related costs including ocean freight, insurance, customs clearance, duties, storage, and distribution charges related to such products and therefore such sales command higher sales prices than direct sales. Domestic orders are for a much smaller size and could be as low as a single unit directly to the end consumer if ordered through an online website. To support an effective e-commerce business model, we will be required to warehouse adequate inventory levels enabling the Company to ship orders directly to the end consumer expediently.
 
Occasionally as part of the marketing program the Company may provide marketing allowances to the customer to ensure, that the retailer is not left with unsold inventories at the end of the program. As an accounting practice, depending on the item and its selling history, the Company will accrue a reserve for possible future markdowns and will retain these reserves for a period 3 to 5 years in the event the customer deducts such a promotional allowance against an open invoice or submits us an invoice. These reserves will be released if not used or needed by the retailer. These allowances are also evaluated when our relationship with a customer is terminated, or we cease selling a specific product to a customer. As of 2022, the Company reversed $81 thousand of promotional allowance accruals, recognizing miscellaneous income as of the year ended December 31, 2022, due to the discontinuation of the LED product line.

The United States is one of the largest consumers of technology-based products, particularly smart home products Currently there are in excess of 120+ million homes in the United States alone with fixed broadband subscriptions. Moreover, there are more than 300+ million smart phone users. These data points alone are indicative of the burgeoning growth potential which is driving investment into Smart Home Products and awareness. Household penetration for smart home devices in 2018 was approximately 7.5% and recent statistics for 2023 state as many as 46% of households as of the date of this filing have at least one smart home device.


For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two customers who comprised approximately 71% of net revenue . Although we have long established relationships with our LED customers, we do not have contractual arrangements to purchase a fixed quantity of products annually. A decrease of business or a loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.


Starting in late 2021, we have utilized social media platforms and online advertising campaigns to further grow the Company’s online presence. In addition to Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn, Capstone has launched a You Tube channel to host Smart Mirror videos and established a Twitter account. Our Social Media marketing has not resulted in any significant sales of products in 2022. We may not be able to effectively compete in e-commerce and Social Media marketing and sales. As such, in 2023 we are returning to marketing to the brick and mortar and Big Box retailers. The Company has a Social Media presence on the following Social Media platforms:

Competitive Conditions
 
The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally, in the lighting and internet of things segments. The Company competes with large multinationals with global operations as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, or particular categories.

13
--


Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training. Smart Mirrors and other Connected Surface products are an emerging industry, and the Company’s product line is innovative and does not require licensing of technologies, as the Connected Surfaces program is developed with open source resources. The Company is also under development of proprietary features that would further establish the Company as a market innovator. As such, applications have been filed. However, the Company may be unable to develop or license emerging new technologies that are dominant.
 
Research, Product Development, and Manufacturing Activities
 
The Company’s research and development operations based in Florida and Thailand design and engineer many of the Company’s products, with collaboration from its third-party manufacturing partners, software developers and Capstone U.S. engineering advisers. The Company outsources the manufacture and assembly of our products to a select group of OEM manufacturers overseas. Our research and development focus includes efforts to:

● | Establish Capstone Connected Surfaces portfolio as an innovator in the smart home segment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop product with increasing technology and functionality with enhanced quality and performance, and at a very competitive cost; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solidify new manufacturing relationships with contract manufacturers in Thailand. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Company establishes strict engineering specifications and product testing protocols with the Company’s contract manufacturers and ensure that their factories adhere to all Regional Labor and Social Compliance Laws. These contract manufacturers purchase components that we specify and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture our products. We leverage the strength of the contract manufacturers and allocate the manufacturing of specific products to the contract manufacturer best suited to the task. Quality control and product testing is conducted at the contract manufacturers facility and at their 3rd party testing laboratories overseas.

Capstone uses its proprietary manufacturing expertise by maintaining control over all outsourced production and critical production molds. To ensure the quality and consistency of the Company’s products manufactured overseas, Capstone uses globally recognized certified testing laboratories such as United Laboratories (UL) or Intertek (ETL) to ensure all products are designed and tested to adhere to each country’s individual regulatory standards. The Company also hires quality control inspectors who examine and test products to Capstone’s specification(s) before shipments are released.


To successfully implement Capstone’s business strategy, the Company must continually improve its current products and develop new product segments with innovative imbedded technologies to meet consumer’s growing expectations. The Connected Surfaces product development is our current effort to achieve those expectations. The continuation of Company’s declining business and financial performance may significantly hinder or undermine efforts to establish a profitable Connected Surface product line capable of sustaining operations. Establishing the Connected Surfaces product line as a viable revenue source is essential to sustaining the Company as a consumer product company. The Company will need adequate funding in 2023 to sustain that business line and operations. Investments in technical and product development are expensed when incurred and are included in the operating expenses.


Raw Materials
 
The principal raw materials currently used by Capstone are sourced in Thailand and China, as the Company orders product exclusively through contract manufacturers in the region. These contract manufacturers purchase components based on the Company’s specifications and provide the necessary facilities and labor to manufacture the Company’s products. Capstone allocates the production of specific products to the contract manufacturer the Company believes is more experienced to produce the specific product and whose facility is located in the country that most benefits from the U.S. Tariff regulations. To ensure the consistent quality of Capstone’s products, quality control procedures have been incorporated at each stage of the manufacturing process, ranging from the inspection of raw materials through production and delivery to the customer. These procedures are additional to the manufacturers’ internal quality control procedures and performed by Quality Assurance personnel.

● | Raw Materials – Components and supplies are subject to sample inspections upon arrival at the contract manufacturer, to ensure the correct specified components are being used in production. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Work in Process – Our quality control inspectors conduct quality control tests at different points during the product stages of our manufacturing process to ensure that quality integrity is maintained. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Finished Goods – Our inspectors perform tests on finished and packaged products to assess product safety, integrity and package compliance.

Raw materials used in manufacturing include plastic resin, copper, LED bulbs, batteries, and corrugated paper. Prices of materials have remained competitive in the last year. The Company believes that adequate supplies of raw materials required for its operations are available at the present time. The Company cannot predict the future availability or prices of such materials. These raw materials are generally available from a number of different sources, and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to currency fluctuations and price fluctuations due to transportation, government regulations, price controls, economic climate, or other unforeseen circumstances. In the past, the Company has not experienced any significant interruption in availability of raw materials. We believe we have extensive experience in manufacturing and have taken positions to assure supply and to protect margins on anticipated sales volume.


Section 1502 of Title XV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires SEC-reporting companies to disclose annually whether any conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product. Based on our inquiries to our manufacturers, we do not believe as of the date of such inquiries that any conflict minerals are used in making our products.
 
Distribution and Fulfillment
 
Since January 2015, the Company has outsourced its U.S. domestic warehousing and distribution needs to a third-party warehousing facility situated in Anaheim, California. The warehouse operator provides full inventory storage, packaging and logistics services including direct to store and direct to consumer shipping capabilities that electronically interface to our existing operations software. The warehouse operator provides full ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), Inventory Control and Warehouse Management Systems.

These fulfillment services can be expanded to the east coast in Charleston, South Carolina, if the Company needed to establish an east coast distribution point. This relationship, if required, will allow us to fully expand our U.S. distribution capabilities and services. As the Company transitions into the e-commerce and direct to consumer marketplace, the Company has developed a new website with full shopping cart capabilities. To complete this project the Company has negotiated contracts for secured credit card processing capability, state sales tax compliance services and order fulfillment and logistics services, at a very competitive rate.
 
Seasonality
 
In general, sales for household products and electronics are seasonally influenced. Certain gift products cause consumers to increase purchases during key holiday winter season of the fourth quarter, which requires increases in retailer inventories during the third quarter. In addition, natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes can create conditions that drive increased needs for portable power and power failure light sales. Climate change may increase the number and severity of hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding. Historically, the lighting products had lower sales during the first quarter due to the Chinese New Year holiday as factories are closed and shipments are halted during this period. Our transition to Thailand manufacturers may reduce the impact of Chinese New Year holiday.
 
We do not have sufficient operational experience with Connected Surfaces to predict the seasonality of Connected Surfaces.
 
Intellectual Property
 
CAPC owns a number of patents and trademarks as denoted below:
 

Patent / Trademark Serial Number | Patent / Trademark Name | Status / Issue Date | Patent / Trademark Expiration Date | Country | Description 
---------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+------------------------------------+---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
97365117 | Connected Chef | Pending | N/A | USA | Trademark on name 
90758255 | Capstone Connected | Pending | N/A | USA | Trademark on name and logo 
90286667 | Thin Cast | Pending | N/A | USA | Trademark on name and logo 
10,203,262 | Apparatus and method for switch state detection and controlling electrical power | 03/12/2019 | 03/12/2039 | USA | apparatus and method for switch state detection and controlling electrical power
D779,109 S | Lamp simulating a UFO | 02/14/2017 | 02/14/2032 | USA | Design patent – lamp simulating UFO 



While the Company may license third party technologies for its products, or may rely on other companies, especially OEMs, for design, engineering and testing, the Company believes that its oversight of design and function of its products and its marketing capabilities are significant factors in the ability of the Company to sell its products.
 
Value of Patents
 
The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Issued patents or patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications may not exclude competitors or may not provide a competitive advantage to us. In addition, patents issued or licensed to us may not be held valid if subsequently challenged and others may claim rights in or ownership of such patents. The validity and breadth of claims in technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, the extent of their enforceability and protection is highly uncertain.
 
Reverse engineering, unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us. We cannot assure shareholders that our competitors have not developed or will not develop similar products, will not duplicate our products, or will not design around any patents issued to or licensed by us. We will assess any loss of these rights and determine whether to litigate to protect our intellectual property rights on a case by case basis.

We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent, and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights from others to support new product introductions. There can be no assurance that we can acquire licenses under patents belonging to others for technology potentially useful or necessary to us and there can be no assurance that such licenses will be available to us, if at all, on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any patent issued to or licensed by us will not be infringed or circumvented by others or will not be successfully challenged by others in lawsuits. We do not have a reserve for litigation costs associated with intellectual property matters. The cost of litigating intellectual property rights claims may be beyond our financial ability to fund.
 
As is customary in the retail industry, many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims. Such claims could harm our relationships with customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages and expend significant Company resources to defend against the claim and or seek a license.


Information Technology
 
The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on those systems to manage our daily operations, communicate with our customers and maintain our financial and accounting records. In the normal course of business, we receive information regarding customers, associates, and vendors. Since we do not collect significant amounts of valuable personal data or sensitive business data from others, our internal computer systems are under a light to moderate level of risk from hackers or other individuals with malicious intent to gain unauthorized access to our computer systems. Cyberattacks are growing in number and sophistication and are an ongoing threat to business computer systems, which are used to operate the business on a day to day basis. Our computer systems could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, or other events. The failure of our information technology systems, our inability to successfully maintain our information or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our systems or an event resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or degradation of services provided by critical business systems, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could adversely affect our business operations, sales, reputation with current and potential customers, associates or vendors, results of operations, product development and make us unable or limit our ability to respond to customers’ demands.
 
We have incorporated into our data network various on and off-site data backup processes which should allow us to mitigate any data loss events, however our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:



● | hurricanes, fire, flood and other natural disasters 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | power outage
--+-------------


● | internet, computer system, telecommunications or data network failure Hacking as well as malware, computer viruses, ransomware and similar malicious software code 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Regulations
 
We believe that the Company is in compliance with environmental protection regulations and will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. The Company is not aware of any national, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, the Company cannot predict the effect on our operations due to possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During 2022, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 3 employees in our U.S. office and maintain consulting agreements with 4 individuals, 2 of which resided in Hong Kong, formerly employees of our Hong Kong operation. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our staff is adequate to handle the current operations, but we recognize that the new product line and social media marketing may require additional personnel. Our ability to hire additional personnel is subject to adequate revenue flow and funding.
 
The following table sets forth the number of individuals by function:
 

Employee Function | Number of Employees

Government Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to regulation by federal and state securities authorities as well as various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations governing a consumer products company and a for-profit business. We are not subject to any U.S. federal, state or local regulation that poses, in our opinion, any special or unusual burden or obstacle to conducting our business and financial affairs. Our main concern, although greatly diminished in terms of government regulation is the changing regulatory environment in China and greater Asia and its impact on our ability to access manufacturing sources and obtain our specific consumer products. Despite some political uncertainty, Thailand continues to encourage foreign direct investment as a means of promoting economic development, employment, and technology transfer. We established Thailand as an alternative to China. While the general trend in China has to be conducive to trade and commerce in terms of U.S. companies conducting business with domestic companies, China is a still a single-party nation-state in which the central government has the power to dramatically and immediately change its trade and commercial policies and laws. The Chinese government has also imposed its laws, policies and directives in Hong Kong SAR, which has created uncertainty about whether Hong Kong SAR will continue to encourage and enable foreign companies to conduct business in Hong Kong SAR without undue interference from the Chinese government. Chinese government intervention in Hong Kong’s political and legal affairs since 2020, which has taken the form of unilaterally imposing Chinese laws and policies in Hong Kong, create a heightened threat of Hong Kong’s traditional pro-foreign business policies, regulation and economic environment being altered to suit national security concerns and international objectives of the Chinese government and becoming untenable for foreign businesses, especially U.S. companies conducting business in Hong Kong in light of growing U.S.-Chinese tensions in international affairs and global economic competition. Chinese government’s imposition of the National Security Law in Hong King on June 30, 2020 undermined Hong Kong’s autonomy and introduced heightened uncertainty for foreign and local firms operating in Hong Kong. On March 5, 2022, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang asserted that Beijing intends to exercise “overall jurisdiction over the two SARs,” referring to Hong Kong and Macau. Political or military conflict between the United States and China, who are rivals for power and influence in Asia and to an increasing extent all along the Pacific Rim as well as being diametrically opposed to one another over the status of Taiwan, could provoke a even more strident, anti-U.S. change in Chinese trade or commercial laws and regulation, including Hong Kong trade and commercial laws, that makes it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain consumer products. Such a development would have a serious impact on our ability to compete in the United States in the niche LED consumer product market.


While Thailand has experienced a degree of political instability for decades, due to the influence and intervention of the Thai military in political affairs, the trade and commercial environment in Thailand has been generally receptive to and encouraging foreign commerce in Thailand. U.S. State Department 2022 assessment of Thailand concluded that Thailand remains encouraging to foreign investment and commerce. Due to uncertainties associated with conducting business in China and Hong Kong, the Company established manufacturing capabilities in Thailand through a local contract manufacturing concern in order to reduce reliance on China and Hong Kong for products and engineering.

Working Capital Requirements and Financing
 
In order to successfully launch the online Connected Surfaces business, the Company was required to maintain sufficient on hand available inventory levels, to allow for immediate fulfilment of an online order. This required additional investment combined with investments in new product expansion of Connected Surfaces, new product molds, product testing and outside certifications, package design work, and further expansion of its capabilities in Thailand, the Company may require additional working capital.


On January 4, 2021, the Company entered a $750,000 working capital loan agreement with Directors, Stewart Wallach and Jeffrey Postal. The short-term facility ended June 30, 2021 (“Initial Period’). The Company had the option to extend the Initial Period for an additional six consecutive months, ending December 31, 2021, but decided not to renew.
 
On April 5, 2021, the Company entered into five separate securities purchase agreements (“SPAs”) whereby the Company privately placed an aggregate of 2,496,667 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price $1,498,000 (transactions being referred to as the “Private Placement”). The five investors in the Private Placement consisted of four private equity funds and one individual – all being “accredited investors” (under Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (“Securities Act”). The $1,498,000 in proceeds from the Private Placement was used mostly to purchase start up inventory for the Company’s new Smart Mirror product line, for a major online e-commerce fulfilment company, and the remainder for advertising and working capital.
 
On July 2, 2021, the Board of Directors (“Board”) resolved that the Company required a purchase order funding facility to procure additional inventory to support the online Smart Mirror product. The Board resolved that certain Directors could negotiate the terms of a Purchase Order Funding Agreement for up to $1,020,000 with Directors S. Wallach and J. Postal and E. Fleisig, a natural person. On October 18, 2021 the Company received the $1,020,000 funding under this agreement. The term of the agreement is 30 months with principal accruing a simple interest rate of 5 percent per annum. These loans may be prepaid in full or partially without any penalty.


On May 1, 2022, the Company negotiated three $200,000 working capital funding agreements, to provide $600,000 in funding for daily operations. The Board resolved that certain Directors could negotiate the terms of a Working Capital Funding Agreement for up to a total of $600,000, with Directors S. Wallach (through Group Nexus, a company controlled by Mr. Wallach), J. Postal and Mouhaned Khoury, a natural person. On May 1st the three individual agreements became effective. The term of each agreement is 18 months with principal accruing a simple interest rate of 5 percent per annum. These loans may be prepaid in full or partially without any penalty.
 
On October 13, 2022, the Company negotiated a $50,000 Working Capital Funding agreement with Jeffrey Postal, a director, to provide funding for daily operations (the “Working Capital Funding Agreement”). The term of this agreement is 18 months and principal accrues simple interest at a rate of 5 percent per annum. The loan may be prepaid in full or partially without any penalty.


On December 1, 2022, the Company negotiated a $50,000 Working Capital Funding agreement with Jeffrey Postal, a director, to provide funding for daily operations (the “Working Capital Funding Agreement”). The term of this agreement is 18 months and principal accrues simple interest at a rate of 5 percent per annum. The loan may be prepaid in full or partially without any penalty.


As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a total of $1,802,230 outstanding on the above referenced funding agreements, which includes accrued interest of $82,231.

The Company’s ability to maintain sufficient working capital is highly dependent upon achieving expected operating results. Failure to achieve expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s working capital, ability to obtain financing, and its operations in the future.
 
With the net operating loss of $2.663 million, the Company utilized $1.904 million of cash for operating expenses during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $2.371 million used in the same period last year. During the period, the Company’s cash decreased approximately $1.2 million after securing net proceeds of $700 thousand in working capital loans. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital deficit of approximately ($448 thousand), an accumulated deficit of approximately $9.1 million, and a cash balance of $61 thousand. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
On July 15, 2021, Jeffrey Guzy a Company director, exercised a previously granted non-qualified stock option and purchased 100,000 shares of Company common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $43,500 or a per share price of $.435. The shares are restricted shares under federal securities laws and were acquired by independent Director Guzy. The proceeds were used by the Company for general working capital to support the rollout of the Smart Mirror product line.
 
During 2023 and through the date of this filing, the Company has received $183,500 in working capital note payable proceeds from Director, Stewart Wallach. Principal accrues simple interest at a rate of 5 percent per annum, maturing June 26, 2023 with the ability for the Company to request a 90-day extension. The loan may be prepaid in full or partially without any penalty.
 
On January 3, 2023, the Company negotiated a $40,000 Working Capital Funding agreement with Director Stewart. Wallach (through Group Nexus, a company controlled by Mr. Wallach), to provide funding for daily operations (the “Working Capital Loan Agreement”). The term was originally 60 days but allowed for the maturity date to be extended 90 days by the Company with written notice to Mr. Wallach. Therefore, the $40,000 working capital advance plus accrued interest matures June 2023. Principal accrues simple interest at a rate of 5 percent per annum. The loan may be prepaid in full or partially without any penalty.
 
In addition, we intend to seek alternative sources of liquidity, including but not limited to accessing the capital markets, or other alternative financing measures. However, instability in, or tightening of the capital markets, could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us. An economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and financial performance may also affect the Company’s ability to obtain funding.
 
The Company’s liquidity and cash requirements are discussed more fully in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.
