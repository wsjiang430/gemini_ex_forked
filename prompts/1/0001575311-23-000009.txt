Item 1.    Business.
Our Company
Brookfield DTLA is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013. Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”), and the issuance of shares of 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A preferred stock”) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together, “MPG”). Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“DTLA Holdings”, and together with its affiliates excluding the Company and its subsidiaries, the “Manager”). DTLA Holdings is an indirect partially-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. (“BPY”), an exempted limited partnership under the Laws of Bermuda, which in turn is the flagship commercial property entity wholly-owned by Brookfield Corporation, a corporation under the laws of Ontario, and the primary vehicle through which Brookfield Corporation invests in real estate on a global basis. On December 9, 2022, Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (“BAM”) completed a distribution and listing of 25% of its asset management business — Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. The global alternative asset management business is now owned and operated through Brookfield Asset Management ULC. BAM is now known as Brookfield Corporation. 
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Brookfield DTLA owned Bank of America Plaza (“BOA Plaza”), EY Plaza, Wells Fargo Center–North Tower, Wells Fargo Center–South Tower, Gas Company Tower and 777 Tower, which are Class A office properties, and FIGat7th, a retail center nestled between EY Plaza and 777 Tower. All of these properties are located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the “LACBD”) in Downtown Los Angeles, which has long been a major office district for law firms, accounting firms and government agencies.
On May 31, 2019, Brookfield DTLA Fund Properties II LLC (“Fund II”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement to contribute and transfer all of its wholly-owned interests in Brookfield DTLA 4050/755 Inc., the indirect property owner of Beaudry (previously known as 755 South Figueroa), a residential development property, in exchange for noncontrolling interests in a newly formed joint venture with Brookfield DTLA FP IV Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of DTLA Holdings. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s ownership interest in the joint venture was 22.1%, a decrease from 33.6% as of December 31, 2021 as a result of additional capital contributed by Brookfield DTLA FP IV Holdings LLC to the joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Brookfield DTLA primarily receives its income from lease income, including tenant reimbursements, generated from the operations of its office and retail properties, and to a lesser extent, revenue from its parking garages.
Brookfield DTLA has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) pursuant to Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with its tax period ended December 31, 2013. Brookfield DTLA conducts and intends to conduct its operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT. 
Corporate Strategy
Brookfield DTLA’s current strategy is to own and invest in commercial properties primarily in the LACBD that are of high-quality, determined by management’s view of the certainty of receiving lease income payments generated by the tenants of those assets. 
Competition
Brookfield DTLA competes in the leasing of primarily office space with a number of other real estate companies.
Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning and operating office properties are: the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the LACBD. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.
Segment, Geographical and Tenant Concentration Information
Segment Information—
Brookfield DTLA currently operates in a single reportable segment, which includes the operation and management of its six commercial office properties and one retail property. Each of Brookfield DTLA’s operating properties is considered a separate operating segment, as each property earns revenues and incurs expenses, individual operating results are reviewed by management and discrete financial information is available. Management does not distinguish or group Brookfield DTLA’s consolidated operations based on geography, size or type. Brookfield DTLA’s operating properties have similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services to tenants. As a result, Brookfield DTLA’s operating properties are aggregated into a single reportable segment. 
Management also views the unconsolidated real estate joint venture, Brookfield DTLA Fund Properties IV LLC, as a separate operating segment. This joint venture engages in the development of the multifamily residential real estate property, Beaudry, which has different economic characteristics compared to commercial office and retail properties described above. The progress of the development project, funding requirements, projected returns and other discrete financial information of the joint venture are regularly reviewed by management to assess performance. However, since this joint venture is not considered material to the overall results of the Company, it is not a reportable segment.
Geographical Information—
All of Brookfield DTLA’s properties are owned and our business is conducted in the state of California. 
Tenant Concentration Information—
Brookfield DTLA’s properties are typically leased to high credit-rated tenants for terms ranging from five to ten years, although we also enter into some shorter or longer-term leases. As our entire portfolio is located in the LACBD, any specific economic changes within that location could affect our tenant base, and by extension, our profitability.
A significant portion of Brookfield DTLA’s lease income is generated by a small number of tenants. No tenant accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated lease income during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. See Item 2. “Properties—Tenant Information.”
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, BOA Plaza, Wells Fargo Center–North Tower, Wells Fargo Center–South Tower, Gas Company Tower, EY Plaza and 777 Tower each contributed more than 10% of Brookfield DTLA’s consolidated revenue. The revenue generated by these six properties totaled 96%, 95% and 97% of Brookfield DTLA’s consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Government and Environmental Regulations 
Brookfield DTLA’s office properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA, and we continue to make capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Some of our properties contain, or may have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain, underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, some of our properties contain asbestos-containing building materials (“ACBM”). Environmental laws require that ACBM be properly managed and maintained, and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. We can make no assurance that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders or that such costs or other remedial measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. None of our recent site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or other environmental site assessments on all of the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey. None of the recent site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
The values of our assets are affected by the taxes on real estate transactions. In particular, sales and other transfers of our real estate assets often are subject to real estate transfer and other similar taxes. An increase in these taxes from 0.45% to 5.5% will go into effect on April 1, 2023, which increase is likely to materially and adversely affect the values of our real estate assets.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
As the largest manager of Class A office properties in Downtown Los Angeles, we achieve our sustainability goals through an integrated approach based on three principles: 
•Develop, operate and renovate properties to achieve optimum energy efficiency, occupant satisfaction and reduced carbon emissions. 
•Incorporate innovative environmental strategies in order to achieve best-in-industry environmental performance in all new office developments. 
•Seek best-in-class environmental certifications, actively participate in green industry organizations, and support new initiatives that foster the energy and resource-efficient operation of office buildings and environmentally sustainable communities and practices.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the following energy reduction initiatives were made in our properties:
•At EY Plaza, we replaced the light fixtures in the corridor with light emitting diode (“LED”) fixtures, resulting in energy savings totaling 429 kilowatt hours (“kWh”) per year;
•At 777 Tower, we retrofitted 24 elevator lights and 45 hallway lights to LED to extend the lifespan of the lights and become more energy efficient;
•At BOA Plaza, we completed the lighting projects totaling 680 light fixtures which resulted in total savings of over 133,000 kWh per year;
•We achieved an Energy Star of 87, 91and 94 at BOA Plaza, EY Plaza and Wells Fargo Center, respectively;
•BOA Plaza is undergoing a light retrofit which will result in 204,000 kWh savings; and 
•At Wells Fargo Center, we are replacing our centrifugal chillers with R-11 refrigerant and a 5 cell wood cooling tower, which will reduce our carbon footprint.
Insurance
Properties held by certain Brookfield DTLA subsidiaries and affiliates are covered under insurance policies entered into by the Manager that provide, among other things, all risk property and business interruption coverage for BPY’s commercial portfolio with a portfolio shared aggregate limit of $2.5 billion per occurrence as well as an aggregate limit of $500.0 million of earthquake insurance for California, and $350.0 million of flood and weather catastrophe insurance. In addition, Brookfield DTLA’s properties are covered by a terrorism insurance policy that provides a maximum of $4.0 billion per occurrence for all of BPY’s properties located in the United States. 
To the extent an act or acts of terrorism produce losses in excess of the limits in place, the resulting loss could have a material adverse effect on Brookfield DTLA’s business, financial condition, or results of operations. Brookfield DTLA is in compliance with the contractual obligations regarding terrorism insurance contained in such policies. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Insurance may not cover some potential losses or may not be obtainable at commercially reasonable rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, Brookfield DTLA had no employees. The operations and activities of Brookfield DTLA are externally managed by employees of the Manager.
