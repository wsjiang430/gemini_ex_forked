ITEM 1. BUSINESS
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Banyan Acquisition Corp.
We are a newly formed blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on March 10, 2021 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the “Initial Business Combination”). Although we may pursue an Initial Business Combination target in any sector, industry or geographic location, we currently intend to focus our efforts on identifying business combination targets in the foodservice industry, including:

● | foodservice equipment and supply manufacturers,
--+------------------------------------------------


● | commercial food manufacturers,
--+-------------------------------


● | commercial food dealers,
--+-------------------------


● | industry adjacent digital businesses,
--+--------------------------------------


● | emerging restaurant concepts, and
--+----------------------------------


● | other similar categories of businesses.
--+----------------------------------------

We believe that our management team’s decades of experience and relationships with leading businesses in the foodservice industry and their founders, executives and investors, the extensive industry and geographical reach of our management team’s network and our management team’s prior experience in private markets investing will give us a competitive advantage in pursuing a broad range of opportunities in many industries.
Our management team has decades of experience as operating executives, with demonstrated success growing and investing in foodservice businesses. As both investors and operators, members of our management team have extensive insight into industry and acquisition trends and they have a vast network of industry relationships. Our management team has proficiency in utilizing industry trends and capitalizing on them through acquisition, start-up business creation, and strategic planning. We understand the challenges that the foodservice industry currently faces and believe our team can not only identify a suitable business combination target, but also assist that business in finding opportunities to maximize growth and profitability through strategic plans or acquisition. Additionally, members of our board of directors and our advisors have diverse and additive experiences and networks, enhancing our ability to successfully execute a merger.
We expect to target companies with certain industry and business characteristics, including long term growth prospects, strong management teams, high barriers to entry, opportunities for further acquisition, strong recurring revenues, sustainable operating margins and attractive free cash flow characteristics.
At this time, we have not identified or selected a business combination target or entered into a definitive agreement regarding an Initial Business Combination.
On March 16, 2021, our Sponsor, paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, to cover certain of our offering costs in consideration of 8,625,000 shares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Founder Shares”) and an aggregate of 142,500 of such shares were subsequently transferred to our independent directors, executive officers, certain advisors and an additional party. On November 30, 2021, our Sponsor voluntarily forfeited certain Founder Shares such that our initial stockholders, consisting of our Sponsor, independent directors, certain advisors and an additional party collectively held 6,900,000 Founder Shares. On January 19, 2022, we effectuated a 1.05-for-1 stock split by way of a stock dividend such that our initial stockholders, consisting of our Sponsor, independent directors, certain advisors and an additional party collectively held 7,245,000 Founder Shares upon the effectiveness of such stock split.

On January 24, 2022, we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 24,150,000 units (the “Units”), including the issuance of 3,150,000 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A common stock”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $241,500,000. As a result of the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option, 945,000 of the Founder Shares are no longer subject to forfeiture. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private placement of 11,910,000 of Warrants in the aggregate (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor, BTIG, LLC (“BTIG”) and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. (“I-Bankers”), including 1,260,000 Private Placement Warrants as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, for gross proceeds to the Company of $11,910,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (the “Public Warrants”), except that the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor, BTIG, I-Bankers or their permitted transferees (except for certain limited exceptions described herein). If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor, BTIG, I-Bankers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.
The closing of the Initial Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants generated total proceeds to the Company of $253,410,000. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering and sale of Private Placement Warrants, a total of $246,330,000, comprised of $237,720,000 of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (which amount includes $9,660,000 of the deferred underwriting discount) and $8,610,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (the “Trust Account”). In addition, $1,960,000 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account established in connection with the Initial Public Offering, which was made available for the payment of certain expenses related to the Initial Public Offering and for on-going working capital expenses.
On March 10, 2022, we announced that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and Warrants included in the Units commencing on or about March 11, 2022 on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Any Units not separated will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “BYN.U,” and the Class A common stock and Warrants will separately trade on NYSE under the symbols “BYN” and “BYN.WS,” respectively.
On April 18, 2023, the Company will hold a vote to amend its amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our “charter”) to extend the length of time the Company has until it must consummate an Initial Business Combination (the “combination period”). Our charter currently provides that we may, at our Sponsor’s option, extend the combination period up to two times without stockholder approval, each for an additional three months, for a total of six months, from April 24, 2023 (the “Original Termination Date”) to October 24, 2023 (each such three-month period, a “Funded Extension Period”). The proposed amendment, if passed, would provide that (x) we will have the option to extend the period by which we must consummate an Initial Business Combination by eight months to December 24, 2023 (the “Amended Extended Date” and such extension, the “Extension Option”) with such extension option exercisable upon at least two calendar days’ advance notice (by April 22, 2023) and (y) provide holders of shares of Class B Common Stock the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B Common Stock to shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of an Initial Business Combination at the election of the holder.
The combination period may be extended so long as our Sponsor and/or its affiliates or designees deposit into the Trust Account: (i) with respect to a single Funded Extension Period, an additional $0.10 per Unit (for an aggregate of $2,415,000) (an “Extension Payment”), and (ii) with respect to two consecutive Funded Extension Periods, an Extension Payment prior to each Funded Extension Period, or $0.20 per Unit in the aggregate (for an aggregate of $4,830,000), upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. However, if, prior to the time that an Extension Payment would otherwise be due for either Funded Extension Period, we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination, no Extension Payment will be required for that Funded Extension Period, and the combination period will be extended for the duration of that Funded Extension Period; provided, that our entry into a definitive agreement may only be used to substitute for a single Extension Payment. Our public stockholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with any Funded Extension Periods, whether as a result of an Extension Payment or a definitive agreement. As a result, we may affect such an extension even if a majority of our

public stockholders do not support such an extension and none of our public stockholders will be able to redeem their shares in connection with such an extension. This feature is different than the traditional special purpose acquisition company structure, in which any extension of the company’s period to complete a business combination requires a vote of the company’s stockholders and such stockholders have the right to redeem their public shares in connection with such vote (although an extension without depositing additional funds into the Trust Account could still be pursued in the manner available in the traditional special purpose acquisition company structure (any such extension, a “Stockholder Approval Extension Period”)).
If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the combination period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
