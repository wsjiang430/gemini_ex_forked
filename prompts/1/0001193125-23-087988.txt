Significant Market Opportunities 
 In today’s increasingly populated and interconnected world, traditional modes of urban transportation continue to contribute to congestion and pollution, and they are largely confined to land-based infrastructure. Mobility for the future requires a revolutionary solution. 
 The market opportunities created by our technology are significant. According to an analysis by Frost & Sullivan, the autonomous vehicle services market is expected to grow from a mere $1.1 billion in 2019 to $202.5 billion in 2030 at a CAGR of 60.1%, facilitated by mutually beneficial business models across the entire mobility value chain. To capture the significant growth potential in the AAV market, we strive to continue to innovate and expand the boundaries for air-based mobility.
The sky above has always held possibilities, and we completed our first manned flight test of the XTURISMO LTD EDITION prototype 1 in 2019. The current XTURISMO LTD EDITION made a debut to the public in October 2021 at Fuji Speedway Circuit in Japan. Currently we have 7 purchases total amongst 3 purchasers and at least 10 inquiries to proceed for purchase agreements from Government agencies, corporations and individuals to purchase where we will be conducting flight demonstrations, flight training and inspections before delivery. We plan to begin delivery of the current XTURISMO LTD EDITION in the middle of 2023 for the purchases that have already been confirmed. 
 In the future, we are also preparing to develop new models that are electrically powered and even more compact, and to provide infrastructure such as airways and air traffic control systems in an air mobility society. 
 Our air mobility enables urban mobility to expand into three-dimensional space. We believe our technology will change the future of transportation, improve lives, and create new industries. The XTURISMO LTD EDITION is a full spec version ranging from high quality carbon and equipped with intensive software capability 
 
5 


  which allows manual/autonomous/remote control driving experience. Each XTURISMO LTD EDITION is built to order, and accordingly, we begin production of each specific unit when a confirmed order is received by us. Due to the cost of the XTURISMO LTD EDITION, we have decided to limit the production of the XTURISMO LTD EDITION to 200 units and target high net worth individuals as potential purchasers. Most of the parts were created exclusively for the product with small unit orders resulting in the purchase price to be relatively expensive. The price of the current XTURISMO LTD EDITION is 77.7 million yen ($550,000 USD) per unit (including insurance and installation program) in Japan. We believe the price of the supply parts can be decreased if we are able to obtain more orders, and at such time we believe that we may be able to mass produce a less expensive model to facilitate safe, cost-effective, and easy-to-use air mobility solutions. Additionally, the materials can change depending on the usage omitting out unnecessary features which can also impact the final price to decrease in the future. Beginning from 2025 we plan that our EV version, the internally named project of “Speeder”, are planned to be in mass production where we intend the price to drop significantly. The Speeder is not yet in development as of now. 
 We design, develop, manufacture, market, and operate unmanned aircraft and their supporting systems and infrastructure for a wide range of industries and applications, including passenger transportation, logistics, and smart city management. For example, in a project jointly with Yamanashi prefecture located in a mountainous region in Japan, we have conducted a logistics test for a hypothetical disaster situation using unmanned drones from three different manufacturers equipped with our proprietary air traffic control system (C.O.S.M.O.S.) to control these drones simultaneously. First, we designed and set up minimum flight routes for unmanned drones in C.O.S.M.O.S. that could be used during a disaster. These were then used as airways (equivalent to infrastructure as a smart city), and flights were made to deliver supplies needed in times of disaster by multiple vehicles flying simultaneously along the airways. Additionally, we have conducted similar service with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan. In the field of civil engineering surveying and infrastructure inspections, we are seeking to provide efficient services using unmanned aircraft instead of the existing methods of surveying and visual inspection using Cessna aircraft or physically done by workers. Furthermore, in the passenger sector, we develop, manufacture, sell, and operate XTURISMO LTD EDITION. Our goal is to ensure that both passengers and goods take to the skies safely and conveniently. 
 Orders, Delivery and Financial Results 
 We are developing the following business areas: 
 (1) manned air mobility area, which involves the sale and development of hoverbikes that can float at low altitude through difficult-to-move zones in times of disaster, etc.; 
 (2) unmanned air mobility domain, which provides solutions utilizing industrial drones (integrated provision of R&D, aircraft, operators, operation management, and other software) and the industrial drone business, which involves the sale and development of industrial drones; and 
 (3) the computing power sharing domain, which provides services such as blockchain verification and AI algorithm generation in a fast, inexpensive, and safe manner. 
 
6 


 Below is a breakdown of revenues for each of these businesses. 
 

Gross sales in 2021 totaled $7,830,130 (excluding consumption tax), consisting of $5,218,538 from shared computing and $2,329,487 from unmanned air mobility. In 2021, one significant customer was H.I.F. Corporation, which accounted for 17.2% of the total sales in 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, gross sales totaled $5,207,490 (excluding consumption tax), consisting of $2,582,492 from shared computing, $2,524,998 from unmanned air mobility and $100,000 from consulting service. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one significant customer which was OKMUMA DRONE Co., Ltd, which accounted for 14.9% of the total sales during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
 In the future, considering regulation in each jurisdiction, we assume that the majority of XTURISMO Limited Edition sales will be in the public sector. 
 What Sets Us Apart 
 In this industry, various parties have announced their products, but our products have the following three characteristics compared to other companies. We intend to leverage these characteristics to gain market share. 
 We believe the following characteristics set us apart in each domain. 
 1) Manned Air Mobility Domain 
 Ease of implementation in society 
 Our “XTURISMO Limited Edition” does not require aircraft category approval in Japan, as it is designed to levitate within a range of a few meters above ground effect. In Japan, it can also be used without a pilot’s license, making it a product that is easy to implement in society in Japan. In addition, given that the product is in this category in Japan, an insurance policy developed by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd. as a liability insurance policy exclusively for practical hoverbikes is attached free of charge for users in Japan. We believe this ease of providing insurance and after-sales service in Japan is one of the factors contributing to our competitiveness. 
 In Japan, through numerous conversations, the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has stated that the XTURISMO LTD EDITION does not fall under Civil Aviation Law at this time, but that could change if we make certain additional modifications to the design specifications of the XTURISMO LTD EDITION. We have also received a HS Code from the Tokyo Customs 
 
7 


  office which is registered as code 95-03, where 95 is categorized as “Toys, playthings and sports equipment, and parts and accessories thereof” and subcategory 03 as “Tricycles, scooters, foot-operated vehicles and other similar wheeled toys, doll prams, dolls and other toys, scale models and other similar models for amusement (whether or not operating) and puzzles”. 
 Outside of Japan, we are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, and are working to obtain relevant approvals and permits in the jurisdictions where we plan to sell our products. For example, we have begun the discussion with several public sectors and governments where the use can be limited to public use where the regulations may be limited. Additionally, in the US we have begun discussions with an attorney to discuss and file an application for certification from the FAA seeking the correct category for our product. 
 Practical Driving Capacity 
 The current battery technology has limitations in terms of power and cruising time, making it difficult to achieve a practical cruising time. Our “XTURISMO Limited Edition” achieves a practical cruising time of 40 minutes by utilizing the engine for power. 
Pioneer and Leader in Urban Air Mobility 
 The above features enable us to launch products at a very early date, even by global standards, without having to wait for the long process of obtaining airworthiness and type certification, since we believe our products will not be classified as aircrafts and our products will not be deemed to utilize technological innovation in next generation batteries. We are planning to create an entirely electronic version targeting a 2025 launch. 
2) Unmanned Air Mobility Domain 
 Original Operation Management System 
 This technology has been patented as “an infrastructure system that communicates with air traffic control systems in the air (low altitude) and mutually or unilaterally transmits, manages, controls, authenticates, registers, and settles flight routes and various information (including the use of external data). While many drone-related companies provide solutions focused on specific fields, we believe that our strength lies in the fact that our services are comprehensive, ranging from development in other areas to operation management systems, provision of operators, and data analysis and reporting. 
3) Computing Power Sharing Domain 
 Equipment optimized for those wishing to rent out computing power 
 The computing power sharing service that we offer is optimized equipment for those who wish to utilize computing power, with our proprietary distributed processing algorithm software and shared global computing platform on hardware equipped with the CPU, memory, and SSD required for blockchain and AI lending, in addition to the latest model of GPUs. The system can be used for storage in a general data center. Two models are available: a box-type model that can be stored in a typical data center, and a rack-type model with excellent air-cooling performance. These machines can be stored at our or our partner’s centers. We currently have five centers with a track record of receiving over 1,000 GPU machines. We will continue to generate revenue by operating our current centers on a stable basis.

 Our Strategies 
 We intend to pursue the following strategies to achieve our mission: 
 Transformation into a Global Company 
 We have established three key business areas with the aim of transforming ourselves into a global company. The first is Japan, where our administrative, software, and design bases are located. The second is the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) region, including the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman. UAE will be our first overseas expansion area, with a target year of 2023. We plan to establish an office, research and development (“R&D”) center, logistics, manufacturing, and marketing hub for the vehicles in the GCC region. We believe that this region will be our distribution center to Europe and Asia. Third is the United States (“U.S.”), where we are considering expansion after 2023. In the U.S., we plan to establish an office and R&D center specializing in software. For this purpose, we are considering a capital alliance with a reputable venture capital firm. 
 As such, a global headquarters for finance and marketing will be established, and the ratio of foreign employees is intended to be increased to 50% by 2024. 
 Extend Our Technological Leadership 
 We plan to continue to invest in technological innovation to cement our leadership in Air Mobility technologies and establish ourselves as the industry benchmark for Air Mobility commercial solutions. We will continue to attract talent from around the world to expand our talent pool and drive innovation.

Expand Our Air Mobility Portfolio and Strengthen Our Platform 
 We plan to continue to expand our Air Mobility portfolio and optimize our existing Air Mobility models. We will develop future Air Mobility models for different uses. We will continue to develop our technology platform and ancillary products and services to strengthen our ability to provide end-to-end Air Mobility commercial solutions that address the needs of our customers. 
 Continue Commercialization and Promote Adoption 
 We believe that urban air mobility will be an important part of global transportation in the future. We will continue to commercialize our Air Mobility technology and solutions and promote their adoption worldwide, not only through the sale of our air mobilities, but also through offering services such as manned air mobility services and urban air logistics services. As we continue to improve the regulatory acceptance, production scale and on-the-ground infrastructure of air mobilities, we plan to pilot urban air mobility services with predetermined routes as a precursor to more flexible, on-demand services networks. We plan to work closely with partners and regulatory agencies to foster and grow the commercial Air Mobility market. In particular, we are in discussions with multiple cities around the world to establish urban air mobility services for both passengers and goods. 
Explore New Monetization Opportunities 
 We plan to explore new monetization opportunities by leveraging our Air Mobility technology platform. For example, we may charge recurring fees for our operational and maintenance services for our air mobilities. We may also enter into revenue sharing arrangements with customers to capture greater business opportunities.

 Pursue Strategic Partnerships in Production and Technology 
 We intend to explore and pursue suitable strategic partnerships that can strengthen our production and technological capabilities. We may co-develop new Air Mobility models in collaboration with international industry leaders. 
 Industry 
 Overview of Our Market 
 The industrial drone market, the computing power sharing (cloud computing) market, and leisure use market, in which we are involved, are markets that are expected to grow significantly in Japan and overseas. In addition, the technology staffing business is expected to expand into various fields, although mainly in Japan. 
 Market size by our segment 
 1) Manned Air Mobility 
 The manned air mobility industry has been the focus of much attention, with demonstration tests being conducted in many countries and a roadmap published in Japan under the leadership of the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. 
 
10 


 According to data published by Morgan Stanley Research in 2019, the global market for manned air mobility, including hoverbikes, is expected to grow to over 150 trillion yen (approximately $1,036 billion USD) by 2040 according to long-term global forecasts. Data published by PWC in 2020 indicates that the air mobility market in Japan will grow to approximately 2.5 trillion yen (approximately $17 billion USD) by 2040. According to “Flying Cars Global Market Report 2021” published by The Business Research Company in 2021, the global market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 58.7% to 35 billion yen (approximately $241 million USD) by 2025. The report says that the key to growth will be the development of infrastructure system requirements, aircraft development, and institutional response, particularly in passenger transportation. 
 

(Source: Flying Cars Global Market Report 2021) 
 The manned air mobility field in the air mobility industry, to which we belong, is expected to contribute to solving various social issues such as eliminating traffic congestion and improving productivity in cities, reducing land infrastructure costs for the approximately 20,000 marginalized villages in rural areas (remote islands and mountainous regions) in Japan, transporting people between inhabited islands, replacing helicopters, and diversifying entertainment and sightseeing, as advanced mobility that can go “wherever they want” and “whenever they want.” 
 
11 


 The system is expected to contribute to solving a variety of social issues, such as inter-island transportation among inhabited islands, replacement of helicopters in times of disaster, and diversification of entertainment and tourism. In Japan, since the establishment of the public-private sector council for the air mobility revolution in 2018, studies for social implementation have been conducted, and many companies overseas are also working on development. 
 However, there are various laws and regulations nowadays, and you cannot freely go everywhere. For this reason, we have developed a manned drone for leisure use, and as of November 2022, we are the only company in the world that actually sells such a drone. 
 The performance of the drone itself is limited, as it cannot fly higher than three meters and its speed cannot exceed 60 mph. This has earned it approval from the Japanese government that it is not a flying vehicle, but rather a vehicle that drives on the road, similar to a car. Of course, it cannot be driven on public roads in Japan without a license plate. 
 2) Unmanned Air Mobility 
 The market for the unmanned air mobility industry in Japan, the market utilizing drones, has been expanding against the backdrop of social issues such as labor shortages and aging infrastructure. According to the “Drone Business Research Report 2021” published by Impress Corporation in 2021, the market is expected to grow significantly from 184.1 billion yen (approximately $1,272 million USD) in 2020 to 646.8 billion yen (approximately $4,469 million USD) in 2025. Among these, the drone service market, on which we are focusing our efforts, is expected to grow from 112.8 billion yen (approximately $779 million USD) in 2020 to 436.1 billion yen approximately $3,013 million USD) in 2025. Looking at the service market by sector, the inspection sector, which we are focusing on, is expected to grow from 39.9 billion yen (approximately $275 million USD) in 2020 to 171.5 billion yen (approximately $1,185 million USD) in 2025, the logistics sector from 1.5 billion yen (approximately $10 million USD) in 2020 to 79.9 billion yen (approximately $552 million USD) in 2025, and the civil engineering and construction sector from 6.7 billion yen (approximately $46 million USD) in 2020 to 24.7 billion yen (approximately $170 million USD) in 2025.

include military-use drones. The services market represents the sales of companies that provide drone-based services. In the case where a drone is used for only one part of a solution, sales for that part only are estimated. In addition, when public organizations or companies utilize their own drones, estimates are based on the assumption that the drone operations are outsourced to an external company. The peripheral services market includes sales of consumables such as batteries, regular maintenance costs, human resource development, and voluntary insurance.

Source: Drone Business Research Report 2021 (Impress Corporation, published in 2021)* 
 The unmanned air mobility field is attracting increasing attention as a solution to meet the needs for manpower saving and unmanned air mobility in light of the declining working population, aging infrastructure, and the spread of new coronavirus infections, which require contactless and remote access. The government’s Digital Rural City Nation concept mentions the use of drones for logistics and inspections, and large corporations are pushing for the full-scale introduction of drones for inspection, surveying, and disaster prevention. In addition, the government has set a December 2022 deadline for Level 4 (unobserved flights over populated areas), and in June 2021, the House of Councillors passed a bill to amend the Civil Aeronautics Law and enacted it into law. The implementation of the “Level 4” (unobserved flights overpopulated areas) has been steadily progressing. Once the Level 4 certification system for aircraft safety and drone operator licenses are in place, the area where drones can be used is expected to expand significantly and a large market is expected to be created. Under these circumstances, we believe that players who can execute operations as well as develop drone technology will be able to meet demand in the future, and we will work on solutions that provide integrated airframes, operation management systems, and operators. 
3) Computing Power Sharing Domain 
 The market for GPUs suitable for advanced computing, the computing power sharing industry, is expected to grow to nearly 6 trillion yen (approximately $41 billion USD) by 2024, according to GPU market research published by Global Market Insights in 2019 (Global Market Insights, Inc., 2019), as shown in Figure 6, the market is expected to be worth $14,415 million (1.56 trillion yen) in 2019 and is expected to grow to nearly 6 trillion yen (approximately $41 billion USD) by 2024. 

* | GPU is an abbreviation for Graphics Processing Unit, which refers to an arithmetic unit or processor specialized for real-time image processing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13 


 
In the Computing Power Sharing Domain, demand for global computing power is booming. In the future, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and internet of things (“IoT”) are expected to develop more and more, and market conditions are expected to grow explosively. Furthermore, the market for cloud computing of computing power is also expected to expand rapidly in the future, backed by strong demand. 
 Our Business 
 Our business is built on our technology platform, which is designed to develop and market Manned Air Mobility and provide Unmanned Air Mobility operating systems and solutions. In this section, we will describe specific products and services in each area of our air mobility business. 
 (1) Manned air mobility business 
 In the manned air mobility business, we develop and market “XTURISMO Limited Edition.” To complement the single product development of the air mobility vehicle, we are aiming to appeal to a variety of purposes of use and create a product portfolio that is resistant to market fluctuations due to completely different applications: demand for solutions to social problems, including collaboration with national and local governments, and luxury demand targeting the ultra-wealthy who are resilient to recession.

 XTURISMO Limited Edition 
 The basic specifications of the “XTURISMO Limited Edition” are as shown in Figure 1: internal combustion engine + electric drive, maximum speed of 80 km/h (approximately 50 miles per hour), dimensions of 3.7 m x 2.4 m x 1.5 m. The vehicle has been designed to meet the following requirements. Compared to other manned air mobility vehicles designed solely with electric power, this design is highly practical due to its high energy efficiency and long cruising time. The use of lightweight, tough, and non-corrosive Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (“CFRP”) components for almost all airframe components significantly reduces the weight of the airframe and minimizes the drive energy. In addition, we have newly developed a control unit that controls the movement of the airframe, which is optimal for air mobility. In the future, we plan to respond to customization according to the requests of potential purchasers. 
 The current XTURISMO LTD EDITION made a debut to the public in October 2021 at Fuji Speedway Circuit in Japan. Currently we have 7 purchases total amongst 3 purchasers and at least 10 inquiries to proceed for purchase agreements from Government agencies, corporations and individuals to purchase where we will be conducting flight demonstrations, flight training and inspections before delivery. We plan to begin delivery of the current XTURISMO LTD EDITION in the middle of 2023 for the purchases that have already been confirmed. The configuration and mechanism of the airframe for levitation is as follows: one gasoline engine is used to drive the two front and rear main propellers, and four batteries are used to drive the four fronts, rear, left, and right side propellers. Four batteries power the four side propellers, front, rear, left, and right, to achieve attitude control and stability. As shown in Figure 2, the main and side propellers are powered by the wind, which is rectified by ducts arranged around the propellers to create a high-pressure space between the lower fuselage and the ground, and the difference in pressure between the upper and lower fuselage is used to levitate the aircraft. 
 As shown in Figure 3, the names of the various sections of the aircraft and basic operations can be performed using the buttons and levers on the steering wheel. 
 The price is 77.7 million yen ($550,000 USD) per unit (including insurance and installation program) in Japan. The vehicle is expected to be used as a disaster relief vehicle for emergencies and for hobby use on circuits, at sea, etc. For the usage of disaster relief, since Japan encounters a number of natural disasters, we have been in conversation with relevant authorities in Japan regarding situations such as earthquakes, floods and tsunamis, and the use of our products in such situations as upon the occurrence of such events the road infrastructure may be destroyed causing obstacles for emergency access. Furthermore, due to our hybrid engine system, the batteries can be used for electricity supply for disaster affected locations. For example, in a project jointly with Yamanashi prefecture located in a mountainous region in Japan, we have conducted a logistics test for a hypothetical disaster situation using unmanned drones from three different manufacturers equipped with our proprietary air traffic control system (C.O.S.M.O.S.) to control these drones simultaneously. First, we designed and set up minimum flight routes for unmanned drones in C.O.S.M.O.S. that could be used during a disaster. These were then used as airways (equivalent to infrastructure as a smart city), and flights were made to deliver supplies needed in times of disaster by multiple vehicles flying simultaneously along the airways.

C.O.S.M.O.S. is currently available as an unmanned traffic management system “UTM” in service for up to approximately 10 drones. We are currently developing C.O.S.M.O.S. Advanced for further implementation into the air mobility sector, including the ability to monitor an increased number of drones, as well as the ability to link to manned mobility units.

 C.O.S.M.O.S. (Flight Operation Management System) 
 C.O.S.M.O.S. is a platform technology for unmanned AMVs and air mobility, including drones, to enable more reliable planning, monitoring, and management of the health of the aircraft, operational certainty, and safety of the surrounding area and operators, which are the principles of automated unmanned AMV operations. While seamlessly connecting to the Drone Information Platform System (“DIPS”) and Flight Operation Management Integration Function (“FIMS”) defined by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (“MLIT”), it visualizes safe and secure operations by realizing both “spatial management” and “flight management,” thereby accelerating the speed of social implementation of drones. 
 C.O.S.M.O.S. can consolidate all the information necessary for drone flight management, including not only flight route information, but also aircraft information, operator information, and national drone license information, which will begin in 2022. At the same time, during flight, the current position, supplemented by Global Positioning System (“GPS”) and Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) overhead, is projected onto map data and three dimensional (“3D”) spatial data, and the current surrounding environment is also monitored by a 360-degree camera attached to the drone. Municipalities where drones fly overhead and operators who use drones on a daily basis will be able to check this information in real time as needed, thereby realizing safe and secure operations. 
 The fee structure is currently being quoted on a case-by-case basis as we are in the process of conducting demonstration tests with large corporations and local governments. 
 Other companies have developed operation management systems, such as those developed by KDDI Corporation and NTT DoCoMo, which were also selected for NEDO’s demonstration experiment. However, we are developing functions with the highest priority on the safe and secure use of drones by local governments.

 C.O.S.M.O.S. Hub (Operator Network) 
 Data on more than 100 registered pilots throughout Japan is centrally managed by the pilot operation system “C.O.S.M.O.S. Hub (Cosmos Hub)”. This system enables quick and efficient matching of registered pilots throughout Japan with operators who place orders. The system also allows for the prompt and efficient matching of registered pilots with operators throughout Japan. In addition, the system provides highly accurate safety management manuals and business etiquette training to pilots registered with the system, enabling the provision of safe, secure, and high-quality drone solutions anywhere in Japan. We have built a system that enables us to provide safe, secure, and high-quality drone solutions anywhere in Japan. For example, in the agricultural sensing area, we have a track record of providing solutions in 36 prefectures throughout Japan by 2021. 
 Our fee structure is quoted on a case-by-case basis, based on the required aircraft, pilot skills, data analysis, and report generation. 
 Although it is difficult to compare our solutions with those offered by other companies because they are not publicly available, we can say that our nationwide network of pilots has been independently developed since early on, and our flight operation management system has only been provided on a trial basis by KDDI Corporation and NTT DoCoMo, Inc. In addition, there are no carrier-independent services that provide a set of services with their own lines. 
 Drone Photography Business 
 We also have the following website: Kusatsu.com, through which we receive orders for drone solutions provided by our unmanned air mobility business. Via this website, we receive orders for aerial photography, inspections, video editing and creating reports. The main services provided by this website are filling orders for aerial photography and movies and we mainly provide images and videos, and sometimes we also provide promotional videos including editing services. Most of the customers for these services are companies, and in fiscal year 2021 we received 95 orders through this website from a total of 42 customers, in 2022 we received 62 orders through this website from a total of 22 customers. We use our affiliated network of drone operators to provide this service. Since drone aerial photography is carried out in various regions in Japan, we provide 
 
19 


  services in cooperation with drone operators in each region so that we can render the service widely and efficiently. We outsource the work to an operator who owns the necessary equipment and possesses the skills necessary to fill each order. 
 Joint Research and Development 
 Our joint R&D with large companies is characterized by the wealth of experience of our business development team and our engineering team, and by the close collaboration between the two teams to promote the project. The business development team consists of members who have consulting experience with major manufacturers and other companies at major strategy consulting firms, and are familiar with the key points of starting up a new business in a large corporation. The engineering team, on the other hand, has many members from Japan and overseas with experience at other drone companies, etc. The team also has a wide range of areas of expertise, from drone airframe development to AI engineers who analyze information obtained from the sensors mounted on the drone. We are capable of building a wide range of drone and AI solutions. In addition, for the areas where we collaborate with many large companies based on their needs, we have established a system that enables us to achieve many results with inexpensive joint development costs by developing the base aircraft and software in-house.
For example, as shown in Figure 7, we have implemented a drone-based individual delivery system for the “Green Infrastructure Model,” a concept home for a sustainable future built at Misawa Park Tokyo (Suginami-ku, Tokyo), a home-building experience facility, with Misawa Homes Co. Ltd. and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Ltd. in the world’s first demonstration experiment of unmanned operation using commercially operated container vessels, as shown in Figure 8. 
 Our fee structure is based on an individual estimate of the necessary development details. 
 Although it is difficult to compare our services with those provided by other companies because the contents of our services are not disclosed to the public, we believe that we are unique in that we can promote and design projects not only from a technical perspective but also from the perspective of contributing to management by having members from major consulting firms participate in the development of the project.

 (3) Computing Power Sharing Domain 
 A.L.I. Albatross (our original GPU machine) 
 Our shared computing service is currently available and the proprietary software technology allows existing or newly purchased computers to efficiently utilize capability for computing and rendering. Our shared computing service is a system that provides efficient computing power through distributed processing and was initially developed primarily for the purpose of computer generated graphics and game rendering. In addition to the latest model of GPU, this equipment is optimized for those who wish to rent out computing power, with hardware equipped with CPU, memory, and Solid State Drive (“SSD”) necessary for blockchain and AI lending, and our proprietary distributed processing algorithm software. Two models are available: a box-type model that can be stored in a typical data center, and a rack-type model with excellent air-cooling performance. These machines can be stored at our or our partner’s centers. We currently have five centers with a track record of more than 1,000 GPU machines in storage. 
 
21 


 The Details of our Shared Computing System are as follows: 
 

Additionally we have expanded our services to the deep learning area of AI, and in 2020, we participated in an AI program to analyze corona vaccines. Further, our shared computing technology is also intended for the use of the future sky road visualization. Furthermore, we have applied game rendering and computer graphics rendering technology to visualize the sky road planned to be implemented in the unmanned traffic management system for air mobility infrastructure which we are currently internally using and which is planned for external use in the future. 
 The fee structure consists of a monthly operation management fee for managing the operation of the GPU machines and a license fee in the form of a performance fee based on the utilization of computing power (some of which was received in the form of cryptographic assets at the request of a single purchaser of our shared computing services). Specifically, during the period of January 1, 2021 through October 31, 2022. we received an average of approximately 3.22 Ethereum tokens per calendar month (for an aggregate of 74.06 Ethereum tokens) from a single purchaser of our shared computing services. However, as of December 23, 2022, all of the aforementioned Ethereum tokens have been sold for an aggregate amount of 87,690,644 yen ($605,975 US dollars). Furthermore, other than the Ethereum tokens as described in the immediately preceding sentence, we have not in the past nor will we at any time in the future accept any payment in cryptographic assets. Additionally, our shared computing service is not used for the mining of cryptographic assets. Some external users of our shared computing system may be using it in the blockchain area, but our shared computing system is neither designed for nor endorsed for use for cryptographic asset mining purposes. 
 
22 


 In comparison with computing power services provided by other companies, the service is built by purchasing a large volume of AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) GPUs at a low cost, so it is comparable to services lined up by AWS (Amazon Web Services), etc., which provide NVIDIA-made GPUs for enterprise use) and other services that offer NVIDIA-made enterprise GPUs.

Regulatory Approvals Relating to our Air Mobilities 
 We operate in a new and rapidly evolving industry, which is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements. While regulations governing this industry are evolving, currently in the jurisdictions where we sell 
 
23 


  and plan to sell our products, the commercial use of our manned air mobilities, and in some cases our unmanned air mobilities, is subject to an uncertain or lengthy approval process. In order for our customers to use our manned air mobilities, we are working on obtaining, or working closely with our customers, to obtain relevant approvals and permits in the jurisdictions where we sell and plan to sell our products. We are unable to estimate the average length of time required to obtain the applicable regulatory approvals due to the nascent nature of Air Mobility-related regulations and the lack of relevant precedents.

Manufacturing, Quality Control and Supply Chain 
 Manufacturing 
 We adopt a lean and efficient production strategy across our business, focusing on effective prototyping, manufacturing, supply chain management, final assembly, integration, quality and final acceptance testing. 
 Our manufacturing procedures system as to the Xturismo Limited Edition is as follows: 
 

Sub Assembly, manufacturing, and shipping of the Xturismo Limited Edition is done by relevant members at our facilities in Yamato, Kanagawa Prefecture, and testing is done by members at our facilities in Minobu, Yamanashi Prefecture. Assembly itself takes about one week, but it typically takes 4 months from ordering parts to delivery. The number of workers is increased or decreased depending on the production volume, but since the assembly is basically made-to-order, it is based on multi-skilled workers: 4 to 6 workers per unit. In addition, several members of quality control and production control are involved. General operation and flight tests are conducted for shipping inspection which takes 1-2 days. With regard to part suppliers, we have collaborated with Toray Carbon Magic Co., Ltd. for CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) chassis, which has a proven track 
 
25 


  record in lightweight and rigidity performance in car racing and air mobility globally. We have also collaborated with Toda Racing Co. Ltd., which has a strong track record in car racing globally, for high-efficiency drive parts. For the internal combustion engine, we are using the proven engine of Kawasaki Motors Ltd., which has a proven track record in the global motorcycle industry. 
 We rely on third party suppliers to manufacture aspects of our products to the following extent: 
 

Key Parts | | Company Name 
Chassis (as described above) | | Toray Carbon Magic Co., Ltd. 
Drive Gear & Shaft (as described above) | | Toda Racing Co., Ltd

 As described above, our products are manufactured and shipped at our facilities in Yamato, Kanagawa Prefecture, which is located at 1-2-11 Fukamidai, Yamato-shi, Kanagawa, and our testing processes are completed at our facilities in Minobu, Yamanashi Prefecture, which is located at 72 Misawa, Minobu-cho, Minami Koma-gun, Yamanashi. 
 Quality Control 
 Our quality control efforts focus on designing and producing products and implementing processes that will ensure high levels of safety and reliability. We have a dedicated quality control team that works with our engineering arm and our suppliers to ensure that the product designs meet safety requirements and functional specifications. Together with our supplier review committee, our quality control team also collaborates with our suppliers to ensure that their processes and systems are capable of delivering the parts and components we need at the required quality levels, on time and within budgets. 
 Our air mobilities are produced with strict product quality control. Our quality control team undertakes robust inspections of our production lines in accordance with internal guidelines and assessment criteria. We also conduct licensed flight tests for the air mobilities of the XTURISMO LTD EDITION prototype 1 under a variety of conditions, which we believe have shown to be an efficient and effective means for us to assess the quality and airworthiness of our products. Data and results generated from flight tests of the XTURISMO LTD EDITION prototype 1 are carefully studied and analyzed to inform any process of alteration or improvement that may follow. In conjunction with our provision of a broad range of after-sales services and assistance to our customers, our air mobilities quality control management extends beyond the point of sale as we continue tracking the performance and quality of our air mobilities. 
 Supply Chain and Value Chain 
 We adopt a strict reviewing mechanism to ensure quality and stability of our supply chain. We also aim to fully engage with our suppliers to foster long-standing and strong partnership with qualified suppliers. Our air mobilities are generally manufactured on specific orders and we have been able to effectively manage our 
 
26 


  inventory level. Historically, we have not experienced significant delays in the supply or availability of our key raw materials or components provided by our suppliers, nor have we experienced a significant price increases for raw materials or components. We do not anticipate any such delays or significant price increases in 2023. Notwithstanding, we cannot guarantee there will be no such delays or significant price increases in 2023. 
 During 2020 and 2021, the Japanese Government issued four series of Declaration of Emergency (which we refer to as the “Declarations”), whereby the Japanese Government requested the closing of non-essential activities and businesses across the country as a preemptive safeguard against the COVID-19 pandemic. This adversely impacted businesses across Japan, particularly in the supply chain sector. 
 During the period, the COVID 19 pandemic and the Government-driven or voluntary closure of workplaces and public spaces, the general public’s reluctance or inability to commute on public transportation, shop, or enjoy outdoor leisure activities have negatively affected our business operations and liquidity position. 
 The first series of Declarations was in effect during the period beginning on April 7, 2020 and ending on May 25, 2020. The second series of Declarations was in effect during the period beginning on January 8, 2021 and ending on March 21, 2021. The third series of Declarations was in effect during the period beginning on April 25, 2021 and ending on June 20, 2021. The fourth series of Declarations was in effect during the period beginning on July 12, 2021 and ending on September 30, 2021. During a portion of the time periods covered by the Declarations, many prefectures were affected, including Kanagawa (the location of our manufacturing and shipping facility), Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Hyogo, and Fukuoka. 
 We have not experienced supply chain disruptions in our business since the end of the Declarations in 2021. Since the end of the Declarations in 2021, we have not had to suspend the production, purchase, sale or maintenance of certain items due to a lack of raw materials; inventory shortages; closed factories or stores; reduced headcount; or delayed projects. For certain parts for our products, such as the engines and other parts, we only have a limited number of our products that require these parts currently in production, and accordingly we have not been affected by supply chain disruptions in this regard. However, as noted above, during the years 2020 and 2021 with the COVID-19 pandemic the Japanese Government implemented a lockdowns where certain factories have been shut down resulting in delay of supply and production of our products. If a Declaration of Emergency is declared in the future, it may cause the suspension of the production, purchase, sale, or maintenance of certain items due to a lack of raw materials, inventory shortages, closed factories or stores, reduced headcount, or delayed projects. This is primarily due to the fact that we obtain all of the parts of our items from third party suppliers pursuant to contract by order arrangements, and accordingly we rely upon those suppliers to provide the requisite items at the time of our orders. If our suppliers do not have enough raw materials or if our suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders due to an absence of a long term contract with us, then we may experience a supply chain disruption as a result. However, we believe that our risk of supply chain disruption is limited since a Declaration of Emergency has not been made since 2021, we have high employee retention, and we require a low quantity of supplies for our items at this time. 
 We have not experienced labor shortages that have impacted our business. We have a high employee retention rate and we believe that we will be able to maintain that rate with competitive compensation. With the limited number of productions currently in place we do not face challenges in labor shortage. However, we will need to increase our labor to increase our production capability in the future. We believe that our unique position where we are entering into a new industry allows us to have access to new hires from vendors and directly by candidates internationally. Once we expand into global business, we will need to hire more employees in selected regions which we need to take necessary measures such as adopting market labor costs in various regions. We are in the process of securing third party employee outsourcing as well in order to be in a position to satisfy an increased commercialization production effort. 
 We have not experienced cybersecurity attacks in our supply chain, however we do have engineers with experience in the cyber security field and plan to take measures to counter any potential cybersecurity attacks in the future. 
 
27 


 Additionally, we have not experienced higher costs due to constrained capacity or increased commodity prices or challenges sourcing materials. We believe that we would be able to absorb higher costs of parts from our suppliers since our margins are high in comparison to the total cost of the parts of our items. 
 We have not experienced surges or declines in consumer demand for which we are unable to adequately adjust our supply. The industry is still in its inception period starting from regulatory infrastructure and the market will likely expand in the foreseeable future. However, if we do experience a surge in consumer demand, we will be highly reliant upon our third party suppliers to provide higher quantities of parts, which we will not have control over since we do not have long term contracts with such third party suppliers. Further, we build our product after an order is placed, and accordingly a decline in consumer demand would not affect our supply. 
 We have not been unable to supply products at competitive prices or at all in certain regions due to export restrictions, sanctions, tariffs, trade barriers, or political or trade tensions among countries. As the XTURISMO LTD EDITION is a new product and unique, we do not see an inability to compete in the foreseeable future. We have obtained a HS Code from the Japanese Customs Office where we do not have any export restrictions. Depending on geopolitical tensions, we may be subject to sanctions, tariffs and trade barriers, however we do not have such issues with our targeted markets currently. Also, we do not have any intentions to market to sanctioned nations in order to comply with regulations of US and Japan. Furthermore, our supply chain is predominantly within Japan; therefore, we have not been exposed to supply chain risk in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and accordingly have not needed to take efforts to mitigate potential impact. 
 The following is Delivery Schedule of our Manned Air Mobility “XTURISMO Limited Edition” and a schematic representation of our value chain. (* Some items are still in the conceptual stage.) 
 


28 


 After-sales Services 
 
 Our “XTURISMO Limited Edition” is based on a levitation range of a few meters above the ground effect, so it is not subject to approval for the aircraft category in Japan and can be used without a pilot’s license. In addition, given that the product is in this category, an insurance policy developed by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd. as a liability insurance policy exclusively for practical hoverbikes is attached free of charge for users in Japan. The figure on the right shows the Maintenance and Coverage Plans that we offer. 

Marketing and Sales 
 Marketing 
 We aim to promote awareness of our brand globally. Our air mobilities are marketed to customers through online events as well as offline promotional and advertising activities. We conduct online marketing through our websites, domestic and international social media, online video platforms and e-commerce platforms, among others. We organize new product launches, company milestone media events, aviation exhibitions and other offline marketing events. 
 Competition 
 We recognize that there are no new alternatives at this time, as hoverbikes and drones themselves are substitutes for existing solutions at this time. The competitive landscape for each of our business areas is as follows. 
(1) Manned Air Mobility Domain 
 Most of the industry’s production experience in the manned air mobility domain is still in the demonstration stage, although EHang in China has produced and delivered products. Many companies are still in the research 
 
29 


  and development stage and are not disclosing their sales prices. As for hoverbikes, we believe that technological innovations in battery capacity density and power will enable competitors to develop hoverbikes that can maintain a practical cruising time even when fully electrified. 
 (2) Unmanned Air Mobility Domain 
 In the unmanned air mobility field, China’s DJI holds a large share of the global market, but from a security perspective, domestic drones are expected to increase their market share in the future. In the area of drones, various players are aiming for various technological innovations in the fields of agriculture, inspection, aerial photography, and logistics. In particular, technologies for autonomous flight and AI-based image analysis are being developed for various applications. While DJI and other companies have announced their sales prices for airframes, many companies do not announce their prices for drone solutions, which are the main focus of our company’s efforts, because many cases are quoted on an individual basis. 
(3) Computing Power Sharing Domain 
 In the Computing Power Sharing Domain, no major companies have entered the market, and it is a decentralized market where small and medium-sized companies are developing their services, making it difficult to identify clear competitors. The three companies with the largest global production share are NVIDIA, AMD, and INTEL. This is an area where GPU makers are working to develop new models with improved computing power. 
 Sales prices increase and decrease according to changes in the supply-demand balance of semiconductors (GPUs, etc.), which are the main component parts. 
 International Competitiveness and Barriers to Entry 
 (1) Manned air mobility domain 
 The barriers to entry in the manned air mobility domain are expected to be very high, as the Company has invested a large amount of R&D funds since 2018, and has been developing the product while applying for/obtaining patent and design rights, and has also successfully developed the product based on partnerships with several companies. In the area of manned air mobility, the launch of the “Xturismo Limited Edition,” a mobility vehicle that can travel in low altitudes within the range of ground effect, is unprecedented worldwide, and we expect it to be internationally competitive. 
(2) Unmanned Air Mobility Domain 
 Although there are no clear barriers to entry in the unmanned air mobility area, we expect certain barriers to entry to exist, as we have been working on building an operation management system using our sky infrastructure patents and a network of drone pilots skilled in various aircraft and operations as early as 2018. (i.e., the drone operator network). In the unmanned air mobility domain, China’s DJI holds a large share of the mass-produced drone “airframe” market. However, the Japanese government has announced a policy of limiting the use of drones for operations that may hinder public safety and the maintenance of order to security-compliant drones in September 2020, and we expect a return to domestically produced drones and global expansion centered on security to increase international competitiveness. 
(3) Computing Power Sharing Domain 
 In the Computing Power Sharing Domain, we expect a certain level of barriers to entry to exist, as we have a track record of managing the operation of many machines and working to improve capital investment and cost efficiency in farms since 2018. In the Computing Power Sharing Domain, we believe that overseas expansion 
 
30 


  will be difficult due to the high cost of electricity in Japan compared to other countries, but we expect that there will be certain barriers for overseas companies to enter the Japanese market from the perspective that providing computing power for local consumption will guarantee security. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We have significant capabilities in the areas of Air Mobilities engineering, development and design and we have developed a number of proprietary systems and technologies. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. In addition, we have entered into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and business partners. The agreements we entered into with our employees provide that all software, inventions, developments, works of authorship and trade secrets created by them during the course of their employment are our property. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we have 72 issued or pending patents in Japan and 46 registered trademarks related to our technology in Japan. As of December 31, 2022, we have 71 issued or pending patents in Japan and 48 registered trademarks related to our technology in Japan. We intend to continue to file additional intellectual property applications related to our technology in the future. Below is an example of one of our patent initiatives.

 COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines, and travel bans, intended to control the spread of the virus. Companies are also taking precautions, such as requiring employees to work remotely, imposing travel restrictions, and temporarily closing businesses. While the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, it has already had an adverse effect on the global economy and the lasting effects of the pandemic continue to be unknown. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the extent of the future impact of COVID-19 is still highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
 Recent Developments 
 Closing of Business Combination 
 We were originally incorporated in Delaware on February 12, 2021 under the name “Pono Capital Corp” as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On August 13, 2021, we consummated an initial public offering. On February 3, 2023, we consummated a merger (the “Merger”) with Pono Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, then called Pono Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Pono”) with and into AERWINS, Inc. (formerly named AERWINS Technologies Inc.), a Delaware corporation pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of September 7, 2022 (as amended on January 19, 2023, the “Merger 
 
47 


  Agreement”), by and among Pono, Merger Sub, AERWINS, Mehana Equity LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sponsor” or “Purchaser Representative”) in its capacity as the representative of the stockholders of Pono, and Shuhei Komatsu in his capacity as the representative of the stockholders of AERWINS, Inc. (“Seller Representative”). The Merger and other transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the “Business Combination”) closed on February 3, 2023 when pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into AERWINS, Inc. with AERWINS, Inc. surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pono, and Pono changed its name to “AERWINS Technologies Inc.” and the business of the Company became the business of AERWINS, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us, “our” “AERWINS,” or “AERWINS Technologies”). 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the total consideration for the Business Combination and related transactions (the “Merger Consideration”) was approximately $600 million. In connection with the Special Meeting, holders of 11,328,988 shares of Pono common stock sold in its initial public offering exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash prior to the redemption deadline of January 25, 2023, at a price of $10.50 per share, for an aggregate payment from Pono’s trust account of approximately $118.9 million. Effective February 3, 2023, Pono’s units ceased trading, and effective February 6, 2023, AERWINS Technologies’ common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “AWIN” and the warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AWINW.” 
 After taking into account the aggregate payment in respect of the redemption, Pono’s trust account had a balance immediately prior to the Closing of $1,795,997. Such balance in the trust account was used to pay transaction expenses and other liabilities of Pono, pay certain transaction expenses of AERWINS, Inc., with the remaining being deposited in AERWINS, Inc. cash account. In connection with the Business Combination, a warrant holder of AERWINS, Inc. received a warrant to purchase 469,291 shares of AERWINS Technologies’ common stock as Merger Consideration as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Consideration will be subject to a post-Closing true up 90 days after the Closing. 
 As a result of the Merger and the Business Combination, holders of Pono common stock automatically received common stock of AERWINS Technologies, and holders of Pono warrants automatically received warrants of AERWINS Technologies with substantively identical terms. At the Closing of the Business Combination, all shares of Pono owned by the Sponsor (consisting of shares of Class A common stock and shares of Class B common stock), which we refer to as the founder shares, automatically converted into an equal number of shares of AERWINS Technologies’ common stock, and Private Placement Warrants held by the Sponsor, automatically converted into warrants to purchase one share of AERWINS Technologies common stock with substantively identical terms. As of the Closing: public stockholders owned approximately 0.3% of the outstanding shares of AERWINS Technologies common stock; the Sponsor and its affiliates owned approximately 6.7% of the outstanding shares of AERWINS Technologies common stock and AERWINS, Inc.’s former security holders collectively owned approximately 93.0% of the outstanding shares of AERWINS Technologies common stock. 
 Lock-up Agreements
In connection with the Business Combination, certain stockholders of AERWINS, Inc. and certain of AERWINS’, Inc. officers and directors (such stockholders, the “Company Holders”) entered into a lock-up agreement (the “Lock-up Agreement”) pursuant to which they are contractually restricted, during the Lock-up Period (as defined below), from selling or transferring any of (i) their shares of AERWINS common stock held immediately following the closing and (ii) any of their shares of AERWINS common stock that result from converting securities held immediately following the closing (the “Lock-up Shares”). The “Lock-up Period” means the period commencing at closing and end the earliest of: (a) six months from the closing (or, in the case of Shuhei Komatsu, AERWINS’ Chief Executive Officer, thirty months from the closing), (b) the date the Company consummates a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party that results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property and (c) the date on which the closing sale price of the Company’s 
 
48 


  common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations and the like) for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period commencing at least one hundred and fifty (150) days after the closing; provided that 1/3 of such restricted shares shall be released from such restrictions if the closing stock price of the Company’s common stock reaches each of $13.00, $15.00, and $17.00. 
 The Sponsor is subject to a lock-up pursuant to a letter agreement (the “Sponsor Lock-up Agreement”), entered into at the time of the IPO (as defined below), among Pono, the Sponsor and the other parties thereto, pursuant to which the Sponsor is subject to a lock-up beginning on the Closing and end the earliest of: (a) six months from the Closing, (b) the date the Company consummates a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction with an unaffiliated third party that results in all of the Company’s stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of the Company’s common stock for cash, securities or other property and (c) the date on which the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations and the like) for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period commencing at least one hundred and fifty (150) days after the Closing; provided that 1/3 of such restricted shares shall be released from such restrictions if the closing stock price of the Company’s common stock reaches each of $13.00, $15.00, and $17.00. “IPO” means Pono’s public offering of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”) at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000, which was consummated on August 13, 2021. 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 On February 7, 2023, AERWINS Technologies entered into indemnification agreements, with each of AERWINS Technologies’ directors containing provisions which are in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. The indemnification agreements will require AERWINS Technologies, among other things, to indemnify its directors against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. 
 Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements
Following execution of the Merger Agreement, certain significant stockholders of AERWINS, Inc. entered into non-competition and non-solicitation agreements (the “Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements”), pursuant to which they agreed not to compete with Pono, AERWINS, Inc. and their respective subsidiaries during the two-year period following the Closing and, during such two-year restricted period, not to solicit employees or customers or clients of such entities. The Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements also contain customary non-disparagement and confidentiality provisions. 
 Registration Rights Agreements 
 At the closing of the Business Combination, certain significant stockholders of AERWINS, Inc. entered into a registration rights agreement with Pono providing for the right to three demand registrations, piggy-back registrations and shelf registrations with respect to the Merger Consideration shares. 
Purchaser Support Agreement 
 Simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser Representative entered into a support agreement (the “Purchaser Support Agreement”) in favor of Pono and AERWINS, Inc. and their present and future successors and subsidiaries. In the Purchaser Support Agreement, the Purchaser Representative agreed to vote all equity interests in Pono in favor of the Merger Agreement and related transactions and to take certain other actions in support of the Merger Agreement and related transactions. The Purchaser Support Agreement also prevents the Purchaser Representative from transferring its voting rights with respect to equity interests in Pono or otherwise transferring equity interests in Pono prior to the meeting of Pono’s stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement and related transactions, except for certain permitted transfers. 
 
49 


 Voting Agreement 
 Simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain stockholders of AERWINS, Inc. entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) in favor of Pono and AERWINS, Inc. and their present and future successors and subsidiaries. In the Voting Agreement for certain stockholders of AERWINS, they each agreed to vote all of their AERWINS, Inc. stock interests in favor of the Merger Agreement and related transactions and to take certain other actions in support of the Merger Agreement and related transactions. The Voting Agreement also prevents them from transferring their voting rights with respect to their AERWINS, Inc. stock or otherwise transferring their AERWINS stock prior to the AERWINS, Inc. approval of the Merger Agreement and related transactions, except for certain permitted transfers. 
Executive Employment Agreements 
 On February 3, 2023, the Company entered into employment agreements (the “Employment Agreements”) with executive officers: Shuhei Komatsu (former Chief Executive Officer), Taiji Ito (Global Markets Executive Officer), Kazuo Miura (former Chief Product Officer) and Kensuke Okabe (Chief Financial Officer). The Employment Agreements all provide for at-will employment that may be terminated by the Company for death or disability and with or without cause, by the executive with or without good reason, or mutually terminated by the parties. The Employment Agreements for Mr. Komatsu, Mr. Ito, Mr. Miura, and Mr. Okabe provide for a severance payment equal to the remaining base salary for the remaining period of the respective term of employment (each term is one (1) year) upon termination by the Company without cause or termination by such executive for good reason. The executive agreements provide for a base salary of $200,000, $200,000, $200,000 and $200,000 for Mr. Komatsu, Mr. Ito, Mr. Miura and Mr. Okabe, respectively, as well as possible annual performance bonuses and equity grants under the equity incentive plan if and when determined by the Company’s Compensation Committee.

The shares would be purchased at 96% or 97% (depending on the type of notice) of the Market Price (as defined below) and would be subject to certain limitations, including that YA could not purchase any shares that would result in it owning more than 4.99% of the Company’s common stock. “Market Price” shall mean the lowest daily VWAP of the Common Shares during the three consecutive trading days commencing on the advance notice date, other than the daily VWAP on any excluded days. “VWAP” means, for any trading day, the daily volume weighted average price of the Common Shares for such trading day on the principal market during regular trading hours as reported by Bloomberg L.P. 
 Pursuant to the SEPA, the Company is required to register all shares which YA may acquire.

The Company is required to have a Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC before it can raise any funds using the SEPA. The Company may not issue more than 19.99% of its shares issued and outstanding as of the Effective Date without first receiving shareholder approval for such issuances, unless such additional shares may be issued consistent with the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Pursuant to the SEPA, the use of proceeds from the sale of the shares by the Company to YA shall be used by the Company in the manner as will be set forth in the prospectus included in the Registration Statement (and any post-effective amendment thereto) and any prospectus supplement thereto filed pursuant to the SEPA. There are no other restrictions on future financing transactions. The SEPA does not contain any right of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages. The Company has paid YA Global II SPV, LLC, a subsidiary of YA, a structuring fee in the amount of $15,000, and, on the Effective Date, the Company agreed to issue to YA shares with aggregate value equal to one million dollars, as a commitment fee.

 Memorandum of Understanding 
 On March 17, 2023, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with Outsourcing Inc. (“OSI”). Pursuant to the MOU, OSI agreed to invest up to 300,000,000 yen (approximately $2.3 million USD) (the “Investment”) in a planned joint venture (“JVC”) between the Company, either directly or through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary AERWINS Inc., or its wholly owned subsidiary A.L.I. Technologies Inc. (“A.L.I.”) with Vault Investments LLC (“Vault”). 
 
53 


 OSI is only required to make the Investment in the JVC, if the following conditions are met by April 30, 2023: 
 

(1) | The JVC is established with the investment of the Company, Vault and OSI;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The terms and conditions of the shareholders’ agreement or the investment agreement have been negotiated between the Company, Vault and OSI and executed (the “Definitive Agreement”); and

 The MOU is effective from the date of entry until April 30, 2023 (the “Term”). Pursuant to the MOU, If the Definitive Agreement is not executed by the end of the Term, OSI will not be obligated to make the Investment in the JVC. Pursuant to the MOU, all disputes in connection with the MOU will be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association in Tokyo Japan. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 AERWINS has not been affected by inflationary pressure as our parts supply has been predominantly limited to within Japan. Japan, relative to other nations, has not experienced inflationary pressures and furthermore, our production number has been limited and the price point being high allows enough cushion if the procurement cost were to be affected in the future. 
Employees 
 Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, at December 31, 2022, the Company had three executive officers and the Company did not have any full-time employees prior to the completion of the Business Combination. 
 We have 103 employees as of March 31, 2023. Of these, 76 are full-time, contract, and short-time regular employees, and 27 are part-time, temporary, or other temporary employees. Since the Company operates in a single segment of the air mobility business, segment information is omitted. The average age of employees is 37.6 years old and the average length of service is 2 years. No labor union has been formed, but labor-management relations are amicable. 
 Our wholly owned subsidiary’s AERWINS, Inc., a Delaware corporation, wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, A.L.I. Technologies, Inc. is covered by various employee social security systems organized by the government, including health insurance, unemployment insurance, pension insurance, and medical insurance, in accordance with the laws and regulations in Japan. 
 We typically enter into standard employment and confidentiality agreements with our key employees. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and non-compete agreements with senior management and intellectual property assignment agreements with core technical personnel. 
 Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees that share our values and vision. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have no material labor disputes and we believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees. 
 Facilities 
 Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the Company’s executive offices were located at 643 Ilalo Street, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813 and its telephone number was (808) 892-6611. The Company agreed to pay Mehana Equity LLC, its sponsor at the time, a total of $10,000 per month for the office space, utilities and 
 
54 


  secretarial and administrative support and the use of this office location is included in such $10,000 monthly payment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, and for the period from February 12, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, the Company incurred expenses of $120,000 and $47,096, respectively, under this agreement. Upon completion of our Business Combination, the Company ceased paying these monthly fees. 
 After the closing of the Business Combination, our headquarters is located at Shiba Koen Annex 6 f, 1-8, Shiba Koen 3-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan 105-0011, where we lease and occupy our office space with an aggregate floor area of approximately 340 square meters from unrelated third parties under operating lease agreements. Our manufacturing and shipping facility is located at 1-2-11 Fukamidai, Yamato-shi, Kanagawa. Our testing facilities is located at 72 Misawa, Minobu-cho, Minami Koma-gun, Yamanashi. 
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we do not currently own any of our facilities. The following table shows the location of our primary leased facilities, the name of the entity leasing the building, the annual rent, approximate square footage, primary use, and lease expiration date. 
 We believe that our existing facilities are generally adequate to meet our current needs, but we expect to seek additional space as needed to accommodate our future growth. There are no major facilities currently inactive. Annual rent below does not include consumption tax.

Insurance 
 We maintain various types of insurance, employer’s liability insurance, to protect assets in the event of any accident that might cause significant losses. We also purchase insurance policies that are either legally compulsory or required by our customers. For example, we maintain third-party liability insurance for unmanned AMVs. We have civil liability insurance with coverage and conditions that our management considers appropriate. For example, we maintain product liability insurance, which covers bodily injury or property damage caused by defects in our products. We believe that our insurance coverage is adequate to cover our key assets, facilities and liabilities. 
 
55 


 Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be involved in disputes and legal or administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to breach of contract, labor and employment claims, copyright, trademark, patent infringement, bankruptcy and other matters. We are not a party to any material ongoing legal or administrative proceedings. 
Government Regulation 
 Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. 
 We operate in a new and rapidly evolving industry, which is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements. As described below, in the jurisdictions relevant to us, the use and delivery of our AMVs are, and in the near future are expected to continue to be, subject to an uncertain or lengthy approval process. We are unable to estimate the average length of time required to obtain the applicable regulatory approvals due to the nascent nature of AMV-related regulations and the lack of relevant precedents. For example, we are not aware of any operator having been granted all required approvals for the operation of AMVs in Japan, the United States or elsewhere. We cannot predict when these regulations will change, and any new regulations may impose onerous requirements and restrictions. 
 As we sell our AMV products internationally, we face challenges in quickly and sufficiently familiarizing ourselves with foreign regulatory environments and policy frameworks. If any new regulation is put in place, or a different interpretation of existing regulation is adopted, our ability to manufacture, market, sell or operate our AMVs or to advertise or deliver air mobility solutions in general may be limited or otherwise affected. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or to obtain, maintain or renew the necessary permits, licenses, registrations or certificates could cause delays in, or prevent us from, manufacturing, marketing, selling and operating our AMVs products, meeting product demand and expectations, introducing new products or expanding our service coverage, and could materially and adversely affect our operation results. If we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to administrative punishment, including fines, injunctions, recalls or asset seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Sales of our AMVs must comply with applicable standards in the market where they are sold, including standards on design, manufacturing and operation. In Japan, for example, certain components of our AMVs must pass various tests and meet criteria specified in Product safety guideline issued by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Japan. We have met the applicable requirements in the guideline and obtained approval of export with Certificate of Non-applicability. Currently, there are 193 members or contracting states in the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”), which is governed by the ICAO Council, which is composed of 36 member states including the United States. Pursuant to ICAO policy we believe that our product will not be considered an aircraft in the United States. However, the future commercial use of our product in the United States may be restricted by various regulations at the federal and state levels, as well as private regulations, such as the prohibition of private mobility near airports, which may prevent the use of our product. Future changes in laws and regulations may also make it impossible to use our product in the ways that are currently planned. Although the United States is a member of the ICAO Council, in the United States, the FAA oversees the safety of aircraft operations in the national airspace system and has the authority to grant airworthiness certificates and related exemptions to unmanned aircraft systems. If we fail to have our AMVs satisfy applicable aerial vehicle standards in any jurisdiction where we operate, our business and operating results 
 
56 


  would be adversely affected. To achieve a high level of safety assurance, we have also established our own AMV safety standards. While we are committed to producing safe and high-quality products, there can be no assurance that our safety technology will be effective in preventing incidents related to product safety, such as accidents involving our AMVs. Failure to ensure the safe operation of our AMVs will affect our reputation and the sales of our AMVs, which will ultimately adversely affect our business operation and financial results. 
 We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business or sell our products, including the Japanese anti-corruption laws and regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations. The FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and business partners acting on our behalf, including agents, from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to a “foreign official” for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. The U.K. Bribery Act 2010 also prohibits non-governmental “commercial” bribery and soliciting or accepting bribes. The Japanese anti-corruption laws and regulations prohibit bribery to government agencies, state or government owned or controlled enterprises or entities, to government officials or officials that work for state or government owned enterprises or entities, as well as bribery to non-government entities or individuals. There is uncertainty in connection with the implementation of Japanese anti-corruption laws. A violation of these laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. 
 We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies and state-owned affiliated entities in the ordinary course of business. We have also entered into joint ventures and/or other business partnerships with government agencies and state-owned or affiliated entities. These interactions subject us to an increased level of compliance-related concerns. We are in the process of implementing policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance by us and our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents and business partners with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, financial and economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations. However, our policies and procedures may not be sufficient, and our directors, officers, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, and business partners could engage in improper conduct for which we may be held responsible. 
 Non-compliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering or financial and economic sanctions laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, and severe administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, collateral consequences, remedial measures and legal expenses, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. In addition, changes in economic sanctions laws in the future could adversely impact our business and investments in our shares.

 UAE Regulation 
 In the United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”), UAE Federal Laws establish the General Civil Aviation Authority (the “GCAA”) which is the authority that governs all civil aviation activities in the UAE. The GCAA has implemented the CAR-UAM to specify the requirements to be met for civil aviation activities in the UAE as well as the grant of an Urban Air Mobility (“UAM”) operator certificate and for the continued validity of such certificate. The CAR-UAM regulations apply to aircraft with a pilot on board as well as remotely piloted aircraft. The CAR-UAM represent the minimum requirements designed to achieve an acceptable level of safety and security for urban air mobility activities in the UAE. 
 Under the CAR-UAM, there are three levels of compliance (i) implemented rules (“IR”) which are binding and used to specify a high and uniform level of safety and uniform conformity and compliance (ii) acceptable means of compliance (“AMC”) which serve as guidance by which the requirements contained in the IR can be 
 
60 


  met and (iii) guidance material (“GM”) which are non-binding explanatory and interpretation materials on how to achieve the requirements contained in the IRs and the AMCs. Additionally, under the CAR-UAM there are alternative means of compliance (“AMOC”) to the AMC’s and may be used by an organization to establish compliance with the CAR-UAM. In order to do so however, an organization would have to first provide the GCAA with a full description of its proposed AMOC which must include any relevant manuals and procedures and an assessment demonstrating compliance with the CAR-UAM. AMOCs can only be implemented if approved in advance by the GCAA. The CAR-UAM also provides that the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) protocols and agreements pertaining to civil aviation and its protection, of which the UAE is a party, will only be considered complementary to the provisions of the CAR-UAM in as much as they do not contradict its provisions. 
 Under the IR’s an urban air mobility operation includes: (i) flights operating primarily in close proximity of populated urban areas, for the carriage by air of passengers, freight or mail, or any combination thereof for remuneration and (ii) where the aircraft used is an Urban Air Mobility Vehicle (“UAMV”), which may be operated with a pilot on-board, remotely piloted or with various degrees of autonomy. Under the CAR-UAM, no organization or person is permitted to conduct any urban air mobility operations in the UAE unless approved by the GCAA under the CAR-UAM. In order to obtain an Urban Air Mobility Operator Certificate or an amendment to an existing certificate, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with the CAR-UAM to the satisfaction of the GCAA. In order to obtain the certificate, an organization must also show to the GCAA that the granting of such a certificate is not contrary to the interests of aviation safety. The application must be submitted through the GCAA E-Service system, and must include the following documentation: 
 

• | Operator’s operations manual;
--+------------------------------


• | GCAA security clearance;
--+-------------------------


• | Safety management system manual;
--+---------------------------------


• | Quality management system manual;
--+----------------------------------


• | Training manuals;
--+------------------


• | Operations manual; and
--+-----------------------


• | Any other documentation as requested by the GCAA.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 There are also associated fees that are required to be paid in connection with the application. If a certificate is issued, it will remain valid so long as the applicant remains in compliance with the CAR-UAM and the certificate has not been surrendered to the GCAA or suspended or revoked by the GCAA. 
 In order to maintain compliance under the CAR-UAM, an organization is required to grant access at any time to the GCAA to any facility, aircraft, document, record, data, procedures and any other relevant materials and must facilitate both planned and unplanned inspections and audits by the GCAA. If after any inspection, the GCAA provides a notice of non-compliance to any organization, the organization must identify the root cause of the non-compliance, define a corrective and preventative action plan acceptable to the GCAA and demonstrate the corrective action implantation to the satisfaction of the GCAA within the time period established by the GCAA. The GCAA may impose restrictions, suspend, limit or revoke a certificate if an operator cannot demonstrate its capability to implement and maintain the appropriate safety standards. Under the CAR-UAM, an operator is also required to report to the GCAA any accident, serious incident and any other occurrence as required by Safety Incident Reporting guidance available on the GCAA website. In the event of an accident or serious incident, an organization must secure all flight data and evidence relevant to the incident aircraft and provide support to the GCAA investigation. 
 Under the CAR-UAM, an operator is required to establish, implement and maintain a management system that includes the following: 
 

• | Clearly defined lines of responsibility and accountability throughout the operator, including a direct safety accountability of the accountable manager;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
61 


 
• | A description of the overall philosophies and principles of the operators with regard to safety referred to as a safety policy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The identification of aviation safety hazards entailed by the activities of the operator, their evaluation and the management of associated risks, including taking actions to mitigate risks and verify the effectiveness of the mitigating actions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining personnel trained and competent to perform their assigned tasks;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Documentation of all management system key processes, including a process of making personnel aware of their responsibilities and procedures for amending this documentation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A function to monitor compliance of the operator with the relevant requirements of the CAR-UAM, this monitoring must include a feedback system of findings to the accountable manager to ensure effective implementation of corrective actions as necessary; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Any additional requirements imposed by the GCAA.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 The management system must correspond to the size of the operators and the nature and complexity of its activities, taking into account the hazards and associated risks inherent in these activities. The organization must also appoint an accountable manager who has the authority to oversee all activities and to ensure that they can be financed and carried out in accordance with the CAR-UAM. An operator is also required to have a sufficient number of qualified personnel for its operators and has to maintain records of this as well as document the training, experience and qualifications of its personnel. An organization must also establish, implement and maintain a safety management system to ensure that the security of their facilities and personnel so as to prevent unlawful interference with the provisions of their services and that the security of operational data that they receive or produce is only accessible to authorized persons. 
 Pursuant to the CAR-UAM, an operator must maintain facilities allowing for the performance and management of all planned tasks and activities. Additionally, under the CAR-UAM, an operator must have in place insurance coverage to cover any liabilities related to their operations, as well as insurance covering occupants and third-party liability. Pursuant to the CAR-UAM, an operator must maintain a system of record keeping that allows for adequate storage and reliable traceability of all activities developed in a format that is acceptable to the GCAA. The records must be stored in a manner that ensures protection from damage, alteration and theft. Additionally, the organization must maintain all flight records including the date and commencement of the time of the flight, the departure and arrival destinations and landing sites, the flight duration, flight paths and altitudes as well as any instructions received from the GCAA command center. The CAR-UAM also requires that an operator keep certain documents on board for each flight, such as the certificate issued by the CAR-UAM. Additionally, pursuant to the CAR-UAM, a UAMV must be deemed to have met “airworthiness” by the GCAA before it can be operated which requires the prior inspection of the UAMV by the GCAA. Further, an operator must meet the maintenance requirements of the CAR-UAM as established by the GCAA. An operator must also comply with all air traffic services requirements, clearances and instructions of the CAR-UAM.
U.S. Regulation 
 The Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, one of several modal organizations within the Department of Transportation, or the DOT, is the regulatory agency in the United States with authority to oversee the safety of aircraft operations in the national airspace system of the United States, or the NAS. By statute, the Congress of the United States, or the US Congress, has vested the FAA with authority to regulate airspace use, management and efficiency, air traffic control, safety, navigational facilities, and aircraft. By contrast, the DOT retains regulatory control over all economic authority granted to commercial operations of aircraft (including for goods or passenger transportation for hire) within the United States. Thus, in addition to any FAA approvals and authorization required for operation of aircraft within the NAS, each aircraft operator conducting commercial operations must also be issued and hold economic authority (or an exemption) from the DOT. Unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, are considered a category of aircraft for purposes of regulation by the FAA and the DOT. Our AAVs are classified as UAS and their operations are therefore subject to the approval by both the FAA and the DOT.

 Note that the description of the regulation of UAS in the United States as provided herein reflects the regulatory landscape with respect to the approval of UAS and UAS operations current as of the date of this document. FAA’s authority, processes and methodologies for the evaluation of UAS operations in the NAS continues to rapidly evolve, and the regulation and processes described herein are subject to change. 
 FAA Regulation of UAS 
 With respect to UAS operations in the NAS, the FAA currently has the authority to promulgate and enforce restrictions regarding (i) the types of flights that may be conducted; (ii) the equipment that may be used to conduct those flights; and (iii) the training required. The regulatory framework applicable to a particular UAS operation is determined by whether (a) the UAS is used by a government agency, for commercial purposes, or as a model aircraft; and (b) whether at takeoff the UAS (including any attachments) weighs less than 55 pounds (Small UAS), or equal to or more than 55 pounds (Large UAS). Importantly, FAA currently considers AAVs to be UAS — the remote pilot requirement for UAS can be satisfied by a person who supervises an autonomous operation but who does not physically guide the aircraft. Our passenger-grade AAVs are classified as Large UAS. 
 Small UAS 
 Small UAS can be operated for commercial purposes under the recently enacted Part 107 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, or Part 107. Importantly, Part 107 explicitly does not permit “air carrier operations,” meaning generally the transport of property over state borders (i.e. interstate operations). However, under Part 107, property can be transported within state borders. UAS operations under Part 107 are subject to a 
 number of operational limitations, including, for example, that the UAS: (i) must remain within the visual line of sight of either the pilot in command or a visual observer, if any; (ii) may not be operated over persons not involved in the UAS operation; (iii) may not be operated at night, and (iv) not be operated within certain restricted airspace (e.g. airspace in close proximity to airports, public stadiums, national parks, etc.). However, §107.200 of Part 107 provides for a mechanism whereby a potential UAS operator can apply to the FAA for a waiver of some of the restrictions described in Part 107, including the restrictions listed in this paragraph. While exemptions to certain restrictions and limitation under Part 107 may be applied for and granted by FAA, Part 107 expressly provides that the beyond visual line of sight restriction cannot be waived if the purpose of the authorized operation is to transport goods. 
 It should also be noted that certain other restrictions do apply, and the FAA will not waive these restrictions. For example, the UAS must be operated by a pilot holding a remote pilot airman certificate. This certificate can be obtained by demonstrating aeronautical knowledge by either (i) passing an initial aeronautical knowledge test; or (ii) holding a Part 61 pilot certificate, completing a flight review once every 24 months, and completing a UAS training course. Pilots must also be at least 16 years of age and vetted by the United States Transportation Security Administration. 
 The FAA has also been directed by the US Congress, and is actively engaged in the rulemaking process required, to revise Part 107 to expand the scope of permissible commercial operations by Small UAS without the need to apply to the FAA for a waiver under §107.200. See “— Recent and Pending Federal Legislation and Regulation” below. 
 Large UAS 
 Large UAS can be operated in the NAS for testing purposes by obtaining authority from FAA pursuant to a special airworthiness certificate in the experimental category, or an SAC. The specific requirements and process for obtaining an SAC are described in FAA Order 8130.34D – Airworthiness Certification of Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Optionally Piloted Aircraft. If the FAA determines the proposed operation does not present an unreasonable safety risk, the FAA will issue an SAC with operating limitations applicable to the particular UAS 
 
63 


  or the proposed operation, as applicable. With respect to operational authority, it is important to note that the FAA will only grant an SAC for the purposes of research and development (R&D), showing compliance with regulations, crew training, exhibition, and/or market survey. Carrying persons or property for compensation or hire is prohibited. Thus, an SAC might be beneficial for the purposes of obtaining authority to test proposed operational concepts, but would not ultimately authorize the carriage of packages or persons for compensation. 
 By contrast, Large UAS can be operated in the NAS for commercial purposes by obtaining two types of authority addressed below. 
 First, a manufacturer must obtain a type certificate (and ultimately a production certificate and airworthiness certificate) from the FAA pursuant to 14 CRF Part 21 with respect to the UAS. 
 Alternatively, if the FAA will consent, the operator may obtain an exemption to all type certification and airworthiness requirements pursuant to an exemption granted under the Special Authority for Certain Unmanned Systems located in 49 U.S.C. § 44807, or a Section 44807 Exemption. By way of background, the Section 44807 Exemption grants the FAA the authority to use a risk-based approach to determine whether a UAS can operate safely in the NAS with respect to a specific proposed operation without complying with those certain airworthiness and operational requirements for which the Section 44807 Exemption is sought. As recently as December 2018, the FAA strongly encourages allowing 90 days for processing of applicable waivers and exemptions. It should also be noted here that the FAA will only grant Section 44807 exemptions for UAS under the operational control of the petitioner (person or organization). Exemptions to operate a UAS will not be granted to a UAS manufacturer unless the manufacturer intends to maintain operational control of the UAS. To receive this type of exemption, the operator must demonstrate that the applicable aircraft can be safely operated in the NAS. 
 Second, an operator must obtain FAA approval for a specific proposed operation, such as the provision of urban air mobility services. In general, the FAA will issue such approval in the form of a Section 44807 Exemption. To obtain a Section 44807 Exemption, an applicant must submit a description of the precise scope of operations to be conducted, the UAS the applicable petitioner intends to use, the flight and communication procedures that will be used, the safety procedures that will be implemented, and training for all personnel involved in the UAS operations. 
 Lastly, in addition to the authority obtained pursuant to either an SAC or a Section 44807 Exemption, petitioners pursuing authority to either test a UAS or operate a UAS commercially must also obtain authority from the FAA to conduct operations in specific airspace within the NAS. All petitioners who are granted either a SAC or a Section 44807 Exemption by the FAA also simultaneously receive a Blanket Certificate of Authorization, or the Blanket COA. This Blanket COA gives an operator the authority to operate Small UAS under daytime Visual Flight Rule conditions at specific altitudes (such as below 400 feet) and outside of certain distances from airports and heliports. Blanket COAs are valid for a set period of time, typically two years. Operators holding either a SAC or a Section 44807 Exemption, and seeking to conduct operations which have been approved by the FAA, but which are in airspace that is outside of the limited scope permitted by the Blanket COA, such as operations above 400 feet, by Large UAS or within close proximity to an airport or other controlled or restricted airspace, will need to apply to the FAA for a Standard Certificate of Authorization, or the Standard COA. The provision of air mobility solutions does not fall within the permitted scope of the Blanket COA and will require a Standard COA alongside an SAC or a Section 44807 Exemption, as applicable. 
 The process and requirements for submitting a petition to the FAA in order to obtain a Standard COA are set forth in FAA Joint Order 7200.23A: Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), or the Joint Order. According to the Joint Order, electronic applications should be submitted at least 60 business days before the proposed start of UAS operations requiring a Standard COA. The proponent must submit an application for a Standard COA using the online application system. Waiver processing times will vary depending on the complexity of the request. The Standard COA will typically describe the airspace and geographic location in which the proposed operations are permitted, as well as the duration of its effectiveness, which is commonly two years. 
 
64 


 Registration 
 Both Small UAS and Large UAS operating in the NAS must be registered with the FAA. Operators of UAS conducting flights under Part 107 can register their UAS through the FAA’s “FAADroneZone” website. Operators of Large UAS can register their UAS by filing FAA Form 8050-1 with the FAA. 
 Airspace Considerations 
 Within the NAS, the FAA has created two categories of airspace: regulatory and non-regulatory, and each category can be further classified into four types: controlled, uncontrolled, special use, and other airspace. The categories and types of airspace are dictated by the complexity or density of aircraft movements, nature of the operations conducted within the airspace, the level of safety required, and national and public interest. The permissibility of UAS operations and the regulations that apply vary with respect to each category and type of airspace. 
UAS Traffic Management 
 The FAA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, and other federal partner agencies are collaborating on two related efforts to create and fully implement a framework to manage UAS operations in the NAS. First, the FAA and NASA are developing the Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management, which is a “traffic management” ecosystem for UAS operations that is separate from, but complementary to, the FAA’s Air Traffic Management system. Research and testing will identify airspace operations requirements to enable safe visual and beyond visual line-of-sight UAS flights in low-altitude airspace.
As part of this effort, the FAA has developed an internet-based platform known as the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability, or the LAANC. The purpose of the LAANC platform is to automate and thus expedite the process for UAS operators to both notify the FAA of flights within five miles of an airport and submit requests to obtain FAA authorization to fly in restricted classes of airspace. This platform, which is already partially implemented, will ultimately enable the FAA to more rapidly issue requested authorizations and waivers. 
 UAS Test Sites 
 In response to direction from the US Congress in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, the FAA ultimately selected seven applicants to establish Test Sites to support UAS integration into the NAS. While they are not the mandatory experimental sites for UAS commercial operators, the Test Sites provide an avenue and a venue to conduct more advanced UAS research and test operational concepts. Data and other information related to the operation of UAS generated by the Test Sites will ultimately enable the FAA to develop regulations and operational procedures for future commercial and civil use of the NAS. 
 Each Test Site has established relationships with the FAA and an existing facility or location that can host the testing of proposed UAS operations. Each Test Site has established credibility with the FAA and may prove helpful in facilitating and expediting the FAA’s validation and evaluation of any data produced during testing. 
 UAS Integration Pilot Program 
 The DOT first announced the creation of the UAS Integration Pilot Program (IPP) in October 2017 consistent with a Presidential Memorandum directing the DOT to create the program. The IPP objectives include accelerating the safe integration of low altitude operations of UAS into the NAS by testing and validating new concepts with respect to beyond visual line of sight operations in a controlled environment, focusing on detect and avoid technologies, command and control links, navigation, weather and human factors. In particular, the DOT has explained that the FAA will use the data provided by the IPP “to advance the overall state of the industry, including the development of enabling regulations that will increase other types of routine UAS operations, such as: (1) beyond line-of-sight flights; (2) operations over people; and (3) package delivery. 
 
65 


  Consistent with this direction, the FAA has indicated that it will rely on the IPP to provide data and insight on expanded UAS operations that will help the agency continue its regulatory agenda to allow expanded operations through incremental rulemakings. 
 DOT Regulatory Overview 
 In order to engage directly or indirectly in air transportation, and in addition to the FAA authority described above, each UAS operator is required to hold economic authority granted by the DOT, either in the form of a “certificate of public convenience and necessity” or in the form of an exemption from the certificate requirement. Air transportation includes transportation of property by aircraft for compensation across state boundaries. 
 In May 2018, the DOT announced procedures to streamline the grant of economic authority to UAS operators proposing to deliver “goods” as an “air taxi.” Under these simplified procedures, UAS operators seeking goods delivery authority must: (1) be a U.S. citizen; (2) maintain liability insurance as required by FAA rules; and (3) register with the DOT. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the DOT has not pronounced any guidance regarding UAS-based passenger transportation for compensation. 
 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
 The FCC governs and regulates radio frequency spectrum. Both the ground-based control transmitter and the airborne video transmitter of UAS come under FCC regulation. Any petition for exemption submitted to the FAA must also describe the radio frequency spectrum used for control of the UAS and associated equipment that is part of the UAS, such as sensors, cameras, and whether it complies with FCC or other appropriate government oversight agency requirements. Thus, before submitting any petition to the FAA, an applicant should ensure that its UAS use certified radio frequencies in the proper strength as specified by the FCC. Furthermore, the security of the communication links between the ground station and the AAV shall be ensured so that unauthorized persons are prevented from gaining control of the AAVs. 
 State/Local Law 
 Though the FAA establishes the applicable rules and regulations with respect to the operation of UAS in the NAS, operators must still comply with state and local laws regarding privacy and public safety. As an example of the type of law that must be followed, in June 2018 the Colorado legislature passed, and the governor signed, HB18-1314 prohibiting a UAS operator from “knowingly” obstructing a peace officer, firefighter, or emergency medical services provider in the performance of their duties. Other state and local entities may try to regulate takeoff and landing areas, noise abatement and other aspects of operating UAS within their jurisdictions. Many of these state and local laws or regulations may however be in conflict with the federal laws and regulations which govern all operations of aircraft (and therefore UAS) in the NAS, and, therefore may be unenforceable in whole or in part. 
 Recent and Pending Federal Legislation and Regulation 
 The FAA has continued to develop regulations to expand the scope of permitted UAS operations in the NAS. The FAA has made public two draft documents according to the announcement by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao on January 15, 2019, which were published in the Federal Register on February 13, 2019. The first of these documents is a draft notice of a proposed rulemaking that would significantly expand the scope of permitted commercial UAS operations under Part 107 by allowing operations at night and over people without first obtaining a waiver from the FAA. In the second, the FAA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the “Safe and Secure Operations of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems.” Additionally, the 2018 Act specifically required the FAA to release new regulations authorizing for-profit package delivery by Small UAS on or before October 4, 2019, but the FAA has yet to promulgate such regulations as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The 2018 Act also provided that while the new rules are pending, UAS operators may avail themselves of existing processes to obtain authority for the delivery of goods, which presumably includes the air taxi exemption process, as described above, that the DOT is currently using for UAS. 
 
66 


  Finally, please note that the FAA has recently announced that its remote identification rulemaking for UAS, originally scheduled for publication in July 2019, will now be published in December 2019. 
 In 2018, H.R. 7395 attempted to facilitate the delivery of medical supplies by UAS for the purposes of improving medical care for rural populations and for patients in need of immediate attention. Although this bill did not ultimately become law in 2018, it is possible that similar legislation may be introduced in the future. 
 Import of AAVs into the United States 
 In general, the importation of our AAVs into the United States should comply with the normal importation and customs procedures, while some unique aspect of the AAVs may require additional analysis and/or licenses, such as the AAVs containing banned or otherwise restricted materials or technology or constituting a product that could be considered as munitions, etc. 
 European Regulation 
 European Union Regulation Related to UAS 
 The main regulation of the European Union, or the EU, in the field of aviation is Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, which is generally referred to as the Basic Regulation by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, or EASA. It was adopted by the European Parliament and the European Council on July 4, 2018 and entered into force on September 11, 2018. It repealed and replaced the previous Basic Regulation, Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. 
 Under the previous Basic Regulation, civil UAS with an operating mass of no more than 150 kg were regulated by each EU member state. On December 22, 2017, the member states endorsed an agreement reached with the European Parliament for the revision of the previous Basic Regulation, extending the competence of the EU to all UAS, except those used for state operations, such as military, customs, police and firefighting, and defining the essential requirements to ensure the safety of UAS. The agreement led to the adoption of the current Basic Regulation. The current Basic Regulation includes a new mandate for EASA in the domain of UAS and urban air mobility. It enables EASA to prepare rules for all sizes of civil UAS and harmonize standards for the commercial market across Europe. 
 Pursuant to the Basic Regulation, the European Commission published a delegated act, Regulation (EU) 2019/945, and an implementing act, Regulation (EU) 2019/947, on June 11, 2019. These regulations aim to protect the safety and privacy of EU citizens while enabling the free circulation of UAS and a level playing field within the EU. They include technical as well as operational requirements for UAS. Both regulations entered into force on July 1, 2019, although Regulation (EU) 2019/947 will not become applicable until July 1, 2020 to give member states and operators time to prepare for and implement it. 
 With the recent regulations described above, the EU has established a regulatory framework that divides UAS operations into three categories according to the level of risks involved: “open,” “specific,” and “certified.” 
 The “Open” Category 
 Operations in the “open” category are those considered to impose low safety risks. To be classified in the “open” category, operations must meet certain technical requirements, including, among others: 

• | the unmanned aircraft must have a maximum take-off mass, or MTOM, of less than 25 kg;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the remote pilot must ensure that the unmanned aircraft is kept at a safe distance from people and that it is not flown over assemblies of people;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | with limited exceptions, the remote pilot must keep the unmanned aircraft in visual line of slight, or VLOS, at all times;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
67 


 
• | the unmanned aircraft is generally required to be maintained within 120 meters from the closest point of the surface of the earth; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the unmanned aircraft may not carry dangerous goods or drop any material.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If UAS operations fall into the “open” category, they can be conducted without any operational authorization. 
 The “Specific” Category 
 Operations in the “specific” category are those considered to impose medium safety risks. When operations do not meet the requirements to be classified in the “open” or the “certified” category (described below), they fall into the “specific” category. 
 For operations falling into the “specific” category, a UAS operator is generally required to obtain an operational authorization from the competent authority in the EU member state where it is registered. To apply for such authorization, the operator must perform a risk assessment and submit it together with the application, including adequate mitigating measures. Ground risks that must be considered include, among others, VLOS or beyond visual line of sight, or BVLOS, population density of the overflown areas, flying over an assembly of people, and the dimension characteristics of the unmanned aircraft. Air risks that must be considered include, among others, the airspace volume used for the operation, the class of the airspace, and the impact on other air traffic and air traffic management. If the competent authority considers the operational risks are adequately mitigated, it shall issue an operational authorization. 
 However, for operations that comply with certain defined standard scenarios, the operator does not need to obtain an operational authorization, but only needs to submit an operational declaration of such compliance to the competent authority of the member state. EASA is expected to publish guidance material and a proposal for two standard scenarios (urban VLOS and rural BVLOS) in October 2019. 
 In addition, UAS operators meeting certain requirements are eligible to apply for a light UAS operator certificate, or LUC. These requirements include, among others, maintaining a safety management system corresponding to the size of the organization, to the nature and complexity of its activities, taking into account the hazards and associated risks inherent in these activities. If an LUC is granted, the holder will not be required to apply for an operational authorization or submit an operational declaration for operations falling into the “specific” category. 
 The “Certified” Category 
 Operations in the “certified” category are those considered to impose higher safety risks than the other categories. The design, production and maintenance of UAS shall be certified if the UAS 

• | has a characteristic dimension of three meters or more, and is designed to be operated over assemblies of people;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is designed for transporting people; or
--+----------------------------------------


• | is designed for the purpose of transporting dangerous goods and requiring a high level of robustness to mitigate the risks for third parties in case of accident.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the UAS is certified pursuant to the criteria above and the operation does involve flying over assemblies of people, the transport of people or carriage of dangerous goods that may result in high risk for third parties in case of accident, then the operation falls into the “certified” category. In addition, UAS operations shall be classified as “certified” if the competent authority, in evaluating an application for operational authorization for operations in the “specific” category, considers that the risk of the operation cannot be adequately mitigated without the certification of the UAS and of the UAS operator and, where applicable, without the licensing of the remote pilot. 
 
68 


 For operations falling into the “certified” category, classical aviation rules apply. In other words, the UAS involved are treated similarly as manned aircraft. They are certified for their airworthiness and have more stringent operational restrictions. The processing time for applications for approvals under classical aviation rules varies among the EU member states. EASA plans to develop amendments to the existing regulations applicable to manned aviation for UAS operations in the “certified” category. The future EASA rules are expected to provide all the requirements to allow UAS operations with comparable procedures applied today to manned aircraft without increasing the level of risk to third parties on the ground and in the air. 
 Registration of UAS and UAS Operators 
 Under Regulation (EU) 2019/947, which will become applicable from July 1, 2020, EU member states shall establish and maintain accurate registration systems for UAS whose design is subject to certification and for UAS operators whose operations may present a risk to safety, security, privacy, and protection of personal data or environment. In addition, UAS operators must also register themselves when operating in the “specific” category and, if certain types of unmanned aircraft are used, in the “open” category. 
 In registration of UAS whose design is subject to certification, information solicited include the manufacturer’s name, the manufacturer’s designation of the unmanned aircraft, the unmanned aircraft’s serial number, and the name and contact information of the person under whose name the unmanned aircraft is registered. The owner of an unmanned aircraft whose design is subject to certification shall register the unmanned aircraft. An unmanned aircraft cannot be registered in more than one member state at a time. 
 In registration of UAS operators, information solicited include names and identification information, contact information, an insurance policy number if required by law, a confirmation by legal persons as to the competency of operational personnel, and, as applicable, operational authorizations, LUCs, or operational declarations with confirmation by the competent authority. UAS operators shall register themselves in the member state where they have their residence for natural persons or where they have their principal place of business for legal persons. A UAS operator cannot be registered in more than one member state at a time. 
 Norwegian Regulation Related to UAS 
 Norway is not an EU member state. However, as a member of the European Economic Area, Norway implements relevant EU legislation in its domestic regulations. Norway is also an EASA member state. 
 Before July 1, 2020, UAS operations in Norway are governed by the Act of 11 June 1993 No 101 on aviation, or the Norwegian Aviation Act, and the Regulation on aircraft that do not have a pilot on board etc. (“Forskrift om luftfartøy som ikke har fører om bord mv.”), or the Norwegian UAS Regulation. Under the Norwegian UAS Regulation, UAS undertakings are divided into three categories, RO 1, RO 2 and RO 3. 
 An RO 1 undertaking is an undertaking in which aircraft with an MTOM of up to 2.5 kg and a maximum speed of up to 60 knots will be operated exclusively within VLOS during daylight hours and subject to fixed safety distances. RO 1 operators must notify the Civil Aviation Authority – Norway, or CAA Norway, before starting up any new undertaking. Such notification shall contain information about the undertaking’s name, address and contact information, as well as information about the type of aircraft that will be used. 
 An RO 2 undertaking is an undertaking in which aircraft with an MTOM of up to 25 kg and a maximum speed of up to 80 knots will be used for VLOS or extended visual line of sight, or EVLOS, operations during daylight hours and subject to fixed safety distances. RO 2 operators must obtain a license from CAA Norway before starting up an undertaking. The application must be accompanied by a risk analysis and an operations manual. 
 An RO 3 undertaking is an undertaking in which the aircraft a) have an MTOM of 25 kg or more, or b) have a maximum speed of over 80 knots, or c) is operated by a turbine engine, or d) will be used for BVLOS operations at altitudes of more than 120 meters, or e) will operate in controlled airspace at altitudes of more than 120 meters, or f) 
 
69 


  will operate over or in the vicinity of crowds of people with certain exceptions for aircraft with an MTOM of 250 grams or less. RO 3 operators must obtain a license from the CAA Norway before starting up an undertaking. The application must be accompanied by a risk analysis and an operations manual. 
 The operator may only use aircraft or systems approved by CAA Norway for the relevant type of operation. The operator must document the aircraft’s airworthiness. The application must be accompanied by documentation of the system design, control system, type of components, technical safety systems and completed test programs that show that the aircraft and system can carry out the relevant type of operation. CAA Norway may recognize aircraft, systems and components approved or certified by other aviation authorities. Based on a consultation with CAA Norway, in general the processing time for applications for approval for RO 3 operators is four weeks provided that all required documentation is included in the application. 
 The goal of the CAA Norway is to implement the new EU UAS regulations, including Regulation (EU) 2019/945 and Regulation (EU) 2019/947, in Norway from July 1, 2020. CAA Norway estimates that the new set of rules will not limit the scope of drone operations in Norway, but there will be new and additional requirements for registration, documentation and competence for operators. The new EU rules will replace the categories of RO 1, RO 2 and RO 3. Registered operators will however be able to operate under these categories until July 1, 2021. 
 Organizational Structure 
 The following is a current organizational chart of our Company: 
 

Corporate History 
 We were originally incorporated in Delaware on February 12, 2021 under the name “Pono Capital Corp” as a special purpose acquisition company, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 
 On August 13, 2021, we consummated an initial public offering (“Initial Public Offering”). The registration statement for the Company’s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on August 10, 2021. On August 13, 2021, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000 (see Note 6) (the “Initial Public Offering”). The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Units at the Initial Public Offering price to cover 
 
70 


  over-allotments, if any. Simultaneously with the consummation of the closing of the Offering, the Company consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 469,175 units (the “Placement Units”) to the Sponsor at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $4,691,750 (the “Private Placement”). 
 On August 18, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, and the closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the “Over-allotment Option Units”). The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 1,500,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $15,000,000. On August 18, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 52,500 Placement Units, generating gross proceeds of $525,000. The Placement Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering. A total of $116,725,000, comprised of the proceeds from the Offering and the proceeds of private placements that closed on August 13, 2021 and August 18, 2021, net of the underwriting commissions, discounts, and offering expenses, was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders. On October 8, 2021, the Class A ordinary shares and Public Warrant included in the Units began separate trading. 
 On March 17, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Old Merger Agreement”), by and among Pono, Merger Sub, Benuvia, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Benuvia”), Mehana Equity, LLC, in its capacity as Purchaser Representative, and Shannon Soqui, in his capacity as Seller Representative. Pursuant to the Old Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Old Merger Agreement, Merger Sub would merge with and into Benuvia, with Benuvia continuing as the surviving corporation. The Business Combination Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2022. On August 8, 2022, the Company and Benuvia mutually terminated the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a) of the Merger Agreement, effective immediately. Neither party was required to pay the other a termination fee as a result of the mutual decision to terminate the Merger Agreement. 
 On November 9, 2022, the Company entered into Purchase Agreements and completed the private sale of an aggregate of 115,000 Placement Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Placement Unit in a private placement and deposited $1,150,000 into the Company’s Trust account for its public stockholders, representing $0.10 per public share, allowing the Company to extend the period of time it had to consummate its initial business combination by three months from November 11, 2022 to February 13, 2023. The Purchase Agreements and related agreements are further described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 10, 2022. 
 On December 31, 2022, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in mutual funds. 
 No payments for our expenses were made in the offering described above directly or indirectly to (i) any of our directors, officers or their associates, (ii) any person(s) owning 10% or more of any class of our equity securities or (iii) any of our affiliates, except in connection with the repayment of outstanding loans and pursuant to the administrative support agreement disclosed herein which we entered into with our sponsor. 
 On February 3, 2023, we consummated a merger (the “Merger”) with Pono Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, then called Pono Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Pono”) with and into AERWINS, Inc. (formerly named AERWINS Technologies Inc.), a Delaware corporation pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of September 7, 2022 (as amended on January 19, 2023, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Pono, Merger Sub, AERWINS, Mehana Equity LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sponsor” or “Purchaser Representative”) in its capacity as the representative of the stockholders of Pono, and Shuhei Komatsu in his capacity as the representative of the stockholders of AERWINS, Inc. (“Seller Representative”).
