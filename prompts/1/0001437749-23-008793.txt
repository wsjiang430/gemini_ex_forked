Business Description
 
CKX Lands, Inc., a Louisiana corporation, began operations in 1930 under the name Calcasieu Real Estate & Oil Co., Inc. It was originally organized as a spin-off by a bank operating in southwest Louisiana. The purpose of the spin-off was to form an entity to hold non-producing mineral interests which regulatory authorities required the bank to charge off. Over the years, as some of the mineral interests began producing, the Company used part of the proceeds to acquire land. In 1990, the Company made its largest acquisition when it was one of four purchasers who bought a fifty percent undivided interest in approximately 35,575 acres in southwest Louisiana.
 
Today the Company’s income is derived from mineral royalties, timber sales and surface payments from its lands. CKX receives income from royalty interests and mineral leases related to oil and gas production, timber sales, land sales and surface rents. Although CKX is active in the management of its land and planting and harvesting its timber, CKX is passive in the production of income from oil and gas production in that CKX does not explore for oil and gas or operate wells. These oil and gas activities are performed by unrelated third parties.
 
CKX leases its property to oil and gas operators and collects income through its land ownership in the form of oil and gas royalties and lease rentals and geophysical revenues. The Company’s oil and gas income fluctuates as new oil and gas production is discovered on Company land and then ultimately depletes or becomes commercially uneconomical to produce. The volatility in the daily commodity pricing of a barrel of oil or a thousand cubic feet, or “MCF,” of gas will also cause fluctuations in the Company’s oil and gas income. These commodity prices are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties external to CKX’s business and over which it has no control, including the global supply and demand for oil and gas, and domestic and global economic conditions, among other factors.
 
CKX has small royalty interests in 20 different producing oil and gas fields. The size of each royalty interest is determined by the Company’s net ownership in the acreage unit for the well. CKX’s royalty interests range from 0.0045% for the smallest to 7.62% for the largest. As the Company does not own or operate the wells, it does not have access to any reserve information. Eventually, the oil and gas reserves under the Company’s current land holdings will be depleted.
 
Timber income is derived from sales of timber on Company lands. The timber income will fluctuate depending on our ability to secure stumpage agreements in the regional markets, timber stand age, and/or stumpage commodity prices. Timber is a renewable resource that the Company actively manages.
 
Surface income is earned from various recurring and non-recurring sources. Recurring surface income is earned from lease arrangements for farming, recreational and commercial uses. Non-recurring surface income can include such activities as pipeline right of ways, and temporary worksite rentals.
 
In managing its lands, the Company relies on and has established relationships with real estate, forestry, environmental and agriculture consultants as well as attorneys with legal expertise in general corporate matters, real estate, and minerals.

The Company actively searches for additional real estate for purchase in Louisiana with a focus on southwest Louisiana and on timberland and agricultural land. When evaluating unimproved real estate for purchase, the Company will consider numerous characteristics including but not limited to, timber fitness, agriculture fitness, future development opportunities and/or mineral potential. When evaluating improved real estate for purchase, the Company will consider characteristics including, but not limited to, geographic location, quality of existing revenue streams, and/or quality of the improvements.
 
The Company’s Board of Directors regularly evaluates a range of strategic alternatives that could increase shareholder value, and the Board and management conduct due diligence activities in connection with such alternatives. These include opportunities for growth though the acquisitions of land or other assets, business combinations, dispositions of assets and reinvestment of the proceeds, and other alternatives. We cannot assure you that the Board’s evaluations or the Company’s due diligence activities will result in any transaction or other course of action.
 
CKX does not perform or cause to be performed oil and gas producing activities inasmuch as: (1) we do not search for crude oil or natural gas in their natural states; (2) we do not acquire property for the purpose of exploration or the removing of oil and gas; and (3) we are not involved in construction, drilling and/or production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas.
 
The Company does not spend any money on research and development.
 
Because of the nature of the Company’s revenue streams, the effect of competition on the Company and its results of operations is not material.
 
Employees
 
The Company has two employees, both of whom are part-time. The Company is not subject to union contracts nor does the Company have any medical benefit, pension, profit sharing, option or deferred compensation programs. The Company has a stock incentive plan adopted in connection with the Executive Employment Agreement effective July 15, 2020, as amended, with its President, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer is also a participant in the plan. The plan permits the Company to grant restricted stock units or performance shares for up to 357,000 shares of its common stock. The Company granted awards for all 357,000 shares issuable under the plan on June 13, 2022. Of those awards, 14,622 restricted stock units and 31,584 performance share units vested and the underlying shares were issued during the year ended December 31, 2022. No awards were granted during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Customers
 
The Company’s customers are those who have mineral leases on Company lands, purchase timber in competitive bids or execute surface leases for farming, hunting, right of ways or other purposes. During 2022, the Company received approximately 66.16% of its total revenues from the following customers:

Customer | Revenue Type | % of Total Revenue | 
--------------------------------+--------------+--------------------+------
Daylight Petroleum | Oil & Gas | | 14.32 | %
Talos Low Carbon Solutions, LLC | Oil & Gas | | 9.86 | %
Coteau Energy LLC | Oil & Gas | | 8.39 | %
Fortune Forest Products, LLC | Timber | | 7.86 | %
EOG Resources, Inc. | Oil & Gas | | 7.72 | %
C6 Operating LLC | Oil & Gas | | 6.18 | %
Bennett Timber Co., LLC | Timber | | 6.11 | %
Louisiana Timber Procurement | Timber | | 5.73 | %

 
Loss of cash receipts from any of these customers or revenue streams would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations
 
The Company does not need government approval of its principal products or services except that the State of Louisiana must permit the size and location of all oil and gas producing units. The operator of the oil and gas units is responsible for this permitting process.
 
The operators of the wells are responsible for complying with environmental and other governmental regulations. However, should an operator abandon a well located on Company land without following prescribed procedures, the landowners could possibly be held responsible. The Company does not believe this would have a material effect on its financial condition.
