ITEM 1.          BUSINESS.
Company Overview
 
Until January 10, 2019, we were engaged in the development of agents for the prevention and treatment of severe and potentially life-threatening infectious diseases. On January 10, 2019, we received a notice regarding the immediate termination of a certain license agreement, dated May 31, 2016 (the “License Agreement”), executed by and between the Company, Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd. (“Hadasit”) and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology R and D Corporation Limited (“RDC”). We relied primarily on the License Agreement with respect to the development of Artemisone, our lead product candidate and a clinical-stage synthetic artemisinin derivative with antiviral and antiparasitic properties. Upon the termination of the License Agreement, the Company ceased having an operating business.
 
 From January 10, 2019 until June 30, 2022, we had no business operations and have been classified as a “shell” company, as such term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 



Present Business
 
On March 6, 2022, we signed a Share Exchange Agreement, as amended (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), with Manuka Ltd., a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Israel, having an office for the transaction of business at 3 Eliezer Vardinon St., Petach Tikva, 4959507, Israel (“Manuka”), pursuant to which Manuka became our wholly owned subsidiary. As the shareholders of Manuka Ltd. received the largest ownership interest in the Company, Manuka Ltd. was determined to be the “accounting acquirer” in the reverse recapitalization. As a result, the historical financial statements of the Company were replaced with the financial statement of Manuka Ltd. for all periods presented, except for the adjustments to reflect the legal capital of the Company. The transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement closed on June 30, 2022 (the “Closing”) and following the Closing, we adopted the business of Manuka. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Manuka (the “Manuka Shares”) from Manuka’s shareholders in exchange for an aggregate amount of 33,791,641 shares of our Common Stock of and 110,000 shares of our Series D Preferred stock (convertible into 66,000,000 shares of our Common Stock) (collectively, the “Consideration Shares”), such that Manuka’s shareholders held, immediately following the closing, eighty-nine percent (89%) of our issued and outstanding share capital (including and assuming the full conversion of the Series D Preferred stock).
 
In addition, on June 30, 2022, we entered into various debt forgiveness agreements with various existing stockholders, including Tonak Ltd. (formerly our largest shareholder), for the forgiveness of an aggregate of $306,117 in outstanding debt in exchange for the issuance of 3,031,567 shares of our Common Stock. On June 30, 2022, we entered into various warrant exchange agreements for the exchange of certain warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock, originally issued in October 2017, in exchange for an aggregate of 2,342,802 shares of our Common Stock. On June 30, 2022, we entered into several debt forgiveness agreement and warrant exchange agreements, including: (i) a debt forgiveness agreement with Cutter Mill Capital LLC, pursuant to which we agreed to issue 894,169 shares of our Common Stock. We also agreed to register all such shares of Common Stock issued to Cutter Mill Capital LLC, within the earlier of 60 days following the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement (provided, however that in the event we have not cleared comments with the SEC with respect to this filing relating to the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, such date shall be 90 days following the date if the agreement) and the date that we file its next registration statement, and agreed to obtain effectiveness within 90 days (or 120 days in the event of a full review by the SEC); (ii) a debt forgiveness agreement with Tonak Ltd., pursuant to which we agreed to issue 1,573,582 shares of our Common Stock; (iii) a debt forgiveness agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd., pursuant to which we agreed to issue 95,256 shares of our Common Stock; (iv) warrant exchange agreements with Globis Capital Partners, LP and Globis International Investments LLC, pursuant to which we agreed to issue 1,585,682 and 616,654 shares of our Common Stock, respectively; (v) warrant exchange agreements with Brian M. Culley and Amiad Solomon, pursuant to which we agreed to issue to each 220,233 shares of our Common Stock; and (vi) an option exchange agreement with Chanan Morris, pursuant to which we agreed to issue to each 780,934 shares of our Common Stock.
 
Since its inception, Manuka’s business activities primarily consisted of distributing Mānuka honey imported from New Zealand, developing and distributing supplements aimed at the beauty and skincare markets and, developing and manufacturing skincare products based on New Zealand’s Mānuka honey and bee venom, among other natural ingredients. All three segments of Manuka’s products are to be marketed and sold solely on our websites. Manuka's skincare products are manufactured in Israel.
 
Manuka was organized under the laws of the State of Israel in March 2020. Manuka is a company with a limited operating history and may contend with risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving markets, including capital and growth expectations as well as fluctuations in operating results and revenues. Manuka’s current products are marketed and sold solely on its website in Israel, www.bmanuka.co.il, and to be marketed and sold globally at www.bmanuka.com.

We currently sell and market our products in Israel through our website, www.bmanuka.co.il. We plan to offer our products on a global basis through our global website, www.bmanuka.com, which is still under development.
 


Our business strategy for commercial sales is intended to be carried out mainly through its online platform and through contracts with leading health food chains and outlets. In September 2022, we started a collaboration with Super-Pharm (Israel) Ltd., one of the leading convenience store chains in Israel, to include our products in their online platform. We have yet to estimate the impact of this new collaboration. We are also planning to work with other third parties, including health food chains retail outlets, and other online distributer for future collaboration. Distribution and marketing of our skincare products and nutraceuticals products would be carried out based on the following practices:
 

1. | Drive growth across skincare and health enthusiast consumer communities. We intend to target skincare and wellness groups across multiple demographics and shopping behaviors. We believe it can drive customer acquisition across both skincare and wellness enthusiasts and up through advertising on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram as well as on, YouTube, TikTok and Google, thus driving our leadership as a diversity-forward brand.

We intend to outsource the following services: technology developments, advertising and social media promotions, and public affair services.
 
Description of Market
 
Our potential market is consumers who purchase  Mānuka honey and bee venom skincare products on the Internet.

Skincare Products containing both Mānuka Honey and Bee Venom
 
We operate in a diverse and competitive market of skincare products that is still in its preliminary phase. Based on an October 2022 DataM Intelligence report titled “Manuka Honey Market Size, Share, Opportunities and Forecast, 2022-2029” and a November 2022 Allied Market Research report titled “Manuka Honey Market by Types: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2019-2026”,  we believe that there is an increasing interest by the public in healthy and natural skincare products, in general, and particularly in Mānuka honey-based products combined with bee venom. To this end, only a handful of companies engage in producing skincare products based on these two ingredients.
 
As the skincare market based on Mānuka honey and bee venom is still in its infancy, we believe that a significant opportunity exists for us in this market segment. In Israel, we are currently the sole player in the domestic market for sales of skincare products with Mānuka honey. We plan to further expand to the global Mānuka Honey and Bee Venom market.

Market Opportunities
 
We believe that the relatively small number of skincare manufacturers that are using the combination of Mānuka honey and bee venom as their leading ingredients offers an opportunity for us to become a player in this market segment. Moreover, we plan to concentrate on the online market, driven by more than 20 years of online marketing experience by our founders. Our skincare products are currently manufactured in Israel by Chic Cosmetic Industries 1987 Ltd. (“Chic”) under the Formula Agreement with Mānuka honey ingredients that are supplied by Waitemata Honey Co. Ltd. (“Waitemata Honey”) pursuant to the supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”).
Competition
 
The Mānuka honey and bee venom skincare market is relatively small but is characterized by a rapidly growing pace and intense competition. Any products that we may successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing and similar products. To mention a few of our competitors that are engaged in producing cosmetic products using Mānuka Honey as a substantial ingredient: Manuka Doctor Ltd. from New Zealand, which also operates in the U.K., in the U.S., in Australia, and Western Europe; ApiHealth NZ Ltd. from New Zealand; Parrs Products Ltd. (d/b/a Wild Ferns) from New Zealand; and Abeeco Ltd., from New Zealand. The cosmetics, fragrances and toiletries market is a highly competitive market, within the segments of our operations. Strong brands and new product launches are important to attract and retain customers. Furthermore, in offering a wide range of categories, our brands compete with several different companies that operate through different distribution channels: direct selling, retail and e-commerce.
Our Marketing Strategy
 
  Marketing and advertising
 
We would enhance our marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to our website and mobile application. We intend to acquire new clients, improve customer retention, and increase frequency of shopping. We intend to communicate with our clients and prospective customers through multiple vehicles, including digital and social media, and Search Engines Optimization (SEO). These marketing strategies would induce the breadth of our selection of products and services, and special offers. Our developing comprehensive public relations strategy would enhance our reputation for excellent skin-care products, and as a future pure Mānuka honey prestigious distributor. We intend to increase our brand awareness, support our customers, and drive awareness of new products through, among others, publishing articles on leading dailies and magazine by journalists and influencers.
  Training and Development
 
We bring an experienced team with over 20 years of online marketing. We plan on concentrating in internet sales market segment, harnessing our knowledge in online marketing, Search Engine Optimization, and social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok for optimal marketing results.
 
We plan to build an online marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any product that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing team would include developing marketing initiatives, a loyalty customer club, and other promotional measures.
 
For our preliminary entry to the U.S., we are in negotiations with a strategic distributor and contract sales entity to assist in the entry to various leading retail chains in the U.S.
 
Our success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified associates at all levels of the organization. We are developing a corporate culture that would enable individual website managers to make comprehensive operating decisions, and we consistently reward high performance.
 
Outside of the United States and potentially Europe, where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
 
Seasonality
 
We currently expect that our business will be subject to seasonal fluctuation. Such estimates of significant portions of net sales and profits to be realized during the fall, winter and spring seasons as well as peaks during seasonal holidays such as Black Friday, Christmas, New Year, and Easter.
Distribution
 
Our vision is to develop an expanded and optimized end-to-end supply chain from the manufacturer of Mānuka Honey ingredients to the customer of our products with such ingredients, that improves operational efficiency, performance, and customer experience. This includes enhanced systems and processes as well as a modernized distribution center network to support our new e-commerce growth globally. Currently, we operate only a single distribution leased center in the city of Petach Tikva, Israel, that supports our e-commerce demand in the territory of Israel. For this purpose, we are in negotiations with a leading marketing and distribution entity in the U.S. to become both our online and Business-to-Business representative (as our representative for distributing our products in the U.S. health, convenient stores, retail outlets and other online distributers). The initial plan is to, firstly, keep on manufacturing in Israel and send the products to a warehouse and distribution center for domestic sales. The second phase would be to locate a local manufacturer that would manufacture our line of cosmetics to be sold in the U.S.
Information Technology
 
We depend on a variety of information systems and technologies (including cloud technologies) to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing website base. As we expand, our technology plans to also include a company-wide network that would connect all users, websites, and our distribution center infrastructure and provide communications for continual polling of sales and merchandise movement at the website level. We intend to leverage technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems, people, and processes. We would update the technology supporting our websites, distribution infrastructure, and corporate headquarters on a regular basis. We will contribute funds and efforts to develop and maintain information systems to facilitate growth and enhance our competitive position.
Intellectual Property
 
We own nine (9) international domain names and seven (7) Israeli domain names. We have an exclusive agreement with Chic that provides that the skincare product formulas are owned by us.
Government Regulation
 
We currently plan to focus on the Israeli and U.S. markets for our current operating business, the beauty and skincare market.
