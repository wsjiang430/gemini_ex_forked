 Company Overview
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing protein kinase inhibitor therapeutics to modify the course of Parkinson’s disease ("PD"), Parkinson’s-related disorders and other diseases of the Abelson Tyrosine Kinases. The Company’s multi-therapeutic pipeline has a primary focus on neurodegeneration and its lead program utilizing IkT-148009, c-Abl inhibitor, targets the treatment of Parkinson’s disease inside and outside the brain as well as other diseases that arise from Abelson Tyrosine Kinases. In 2021, we commenced clinical development of IkT-148009, which we believe can modify the course of Parkinson’s disease including its manifestation in the gastrointestinal tract, or GI. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration or FDA review of the Phase 1/1b data and the protocol for the Phase 2a three- month dosing study resulted in the FDA agreeing with the Company’s view that it was appropriate for the Phase 2a study to begin, prompting the Company to initiate the Phase 2a study, the 201 trial, at the end of May 2022. In October 2022, an IND to expand use of IkT-148009 into the Parkinson’s-related disease Multiple System Atrophy, or MSA, was filed with the FDA. On November 7, 2022, following review of the IND for IkT-148009 as a treatment for MSA, the FDA notified the Company that it was placing the IkT-148009 programs for Parkinson’s disease and MSA on clinical hold. The FDA lifted the full clinical hold in January 2023 for the Parkinson’s programs and in March 2023 on the MSA program, opening the IND for MSA. Twenty of 35 planned sites will be open as of this filing, with screening anticipated to start in early 2Q23 and 120 patients planned to be enrolled overall. The 201 in Parkinson’s trial will start screening patients for enrollment at 50 mg and 100 mg, with the 200 mg dose added back into the trial following submission of the safety and steady-state pharmacokinetic data of the 200 mg dose that was collected in March 2023. Once this data is submitted, the 200 mg dose will be added to the trial after 15 patients have been randomized to 50 mg, 100 mg or placebo groups. The FDA further requested the measurement of visual acuity and examination of the cornea and lens to complement the analysis of retina, macula and fundus that was already part of the ocular monitoring program in the 201 trial.
 Our evaluation of IkT-148009 in MSA has been benefited by a grant received from the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, for $0.39 million to fund animal model studies of IkT-148009 as a therapy for MSA. These animal studies are now underway and our pursuit of clinical development will depend on a demonstration of therapeutic benefit in at least one animal model to proceed with clinical development. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 safety and tolerability study in MSA patients in up to nineteen sites in the EU, and up to six sites in the U.S. involving 60 patients. The proposed Phase 2 study will have primary end points in safety and tolerability and secondary end points in MSA efficacy following once daily dosing at two dose levels for 6-months. If IkT-148009 is not a successful therapy in MSA animal model studies, the Phase 2 clinical study will not proceed. In this circumstance, the regulatory effort for IkT-148009 in the EU would be applied to future studies of Parkinson’s Disease efficacy in the EU. The Company plans to pursue orphan drug designation for IkT-148009 to treat MSA with regulators in the U.S. and Europe.
  The Company is also developing platform technologies for alternate ways to deliver protein kinase inhibitors in patients. Our first example of this technology is IkT-001Pro, a prodrug of the anticancer agent imatinib mesylate, to treat Stable Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (SP-CML). Pursuant to its IND which was cleared by the FDA in August 2022, IkT-001Pro is being evaluated in a two-part dose finding/dose equivalence study in up to 59 healthy volunteers (the 501 trial). The study is designed to evaluate the 96-hour pharmacokinetics of imatinib delivered as IkT-001Pro and determine the dose of IkT-001Pro that can deliver the equivalent 400 mg imatinib, the standard-of-care dose for SP-CML. As of this writing, three of four dose escalation cohorts have completed the trial; it is anticipated that the dose finding/dose equivalence program will be completed by close of 2Q23. Only four mild adverse events have been observed, none of clinical significance for IkT-001Pro. IkT-001Pro has high oral bioavailability and a pharmacokinetic profile of delivered imatinib that closely matches the exposure of imatinib delivered as 400 mg imatinib mesylate. Following the 501 study, Inhibikase will confer with the FDA and seek agreement on the requirements for the NDA process following the proposed approval path for IkT-001Pro under the 505(b)(2) approval pathway. The Company plans to simultaneously pursue a superiority study comparing the selected doses of IkT-001Pro to standard-of-care 400 mg imatinib in SP-CML patients using a novel, two-period-wait-list- crossover-switching study.
 For both IkT-148009 and IkT-001Pro, we have completed clinical batch manufacturing of a film-coated tablet formulation. The bioequivalence studies with IkT-001Pro have already implemented these tablets into the study. A pharmacokinetic bridging study with two different tablet formulations of IkT-148009 is planned to be completed in 2023.


 In our opinion, the multi-decade failures in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD result from a lack of understanding of the biochemistry of the disease processes involved. Neurodegeneration is marked by a progressive degeneration and loss of function of neurons which send and receive signals to and from the brain. Historically, the cause of a neurodegenerative disease was thought to be a “plaque” made up of a misfolded and/ or aggregated protein(s). Therapeutic approaches, therefore, sought to remove “plaque” from the brain. A “plaque”-focused treatment strategy has failed to alter the course of Parkinson’s disease in two Phase 2 trials that reported results in 2020 and 2021. We believe we are different. We identified the proteins that become dysfunctional in a disease pathway and sought to understand how a dysfunctional protein causes disease. We believe our approach to PD and other neurological diseases has identified the underlying cause of disease and led to an understanding of how individual proteins are linked together to define the disease process. Using this strategy, we believe we have discovered at least one enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the disease process for PD, the Abelson Tyrosin Kinase c-Abl. We have developed novel protein kinase inhibitors against c-Abl, which we believe can alter the disease course for PD. C-Abl chemically modifies the “plaque” proteins in PD, known as alpha-synuclein. Chemical modification creates what we believe to be the true toxic entity of the disease. Treatment with IkT-148009 may prevent chemical modification and, at least in animal models of progressive disease, leads to near clearance of the toxic form of alpha-synuclein from the affected neurons.
  We believe we are one of the pioneers of the application of protein kinase inhibitors to non-oncology indications, including neurodegeneration and infectious diseases, as well as their more traditional role in the treatment of cancer. Prior to becoming a publicly-traded company in 2020, more than 50% of the Company’s total funding had been received from Private, State and Federal granting agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense and the Michael J. Fox Foundation, with the balance the result of equity sales in the private sector. Private, State and Federal granting agencies use extensive scientific peer review in deciding which projects to fund that could impact human disease. Our ability to advance the Company on the basis of scientific peer review reflects the potential our scientific peers see for the possible success of our therapeutic programs.
  To increase the probability of success, we are making parallel investments in several product candidates and back-up candidates, and plan to advance only those candidates to the later stages of clinical development that show strong preclinical and early clinical data. By developing a portfolio of product candidates across therapeutic indications, we can continuously apply learnings and tools across programs and leverage economies of scale in our research and development organization. Our target indications include diseases with large patient populations, such as PD, as well as orphan indications, such as Progressive, Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, Multiple System Atrophy and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.
  We currently have worldwide commercialization rights to all of our development programs and IP protection until 2033 or later.
 RAMPTM: Our Reengineering Approach with Metabolism Preserved
Our candidate portfolio relies on our medicinal chemistry design approach which evaluates the human pharmacology of an approved drug and uses the approved drug as a template on which to base a novel drug design. Key to this proprietary process is the reproduction of the metabolism of the template in the new molecule. By preserving the metabolic process and generating metabolites in the new molecule that match the metabolites of the template, we believe the safety profile of the new molecule will be nearly the same as the template. We believe the safety profile will be nearly the same because most side effects arise from the chemical structure, i.e., the drug’s selectivity for the target and the metabolites of the drug. When the metabolites of the template and the new molecule chemically match, there is a high likelihood that the safety profile of the new molecule will be similar to or the same as the safety profile of the template. We validated this was the case for IkT-148009, our lead molecule for PD and related disorders, which used imatinib as a design template. Imatinib is the active ingredient in the anti-cancer drug Gleevec®, whose side effect profile linearly correlates with its oral dose. With metabolite matching between IkT-148009 and imatinib, we believe we can take advantage of the linear correlation between side effects and oral dose because IkT-148009 is 25-fold more potent than imatinib against its therapeutic target, predicting a dose that will be lower than the standard dose of imatinib (400 mg) and predicting a human safety profile that is expected to be no worse than that of imatinib. While the clinical data is still preliminary for IkT-148009, IkT-148009 appears to have a more favorable safety and tolerability profile than the template used to design it.

 Market and Commercial Opportunity
 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 900,000 to 1,200,000 persons in the United States, with 60,000 new cases and 38,000 deaths annually with an average age of onset of 60 years of age. In addition to the 60,000 new cases each year, thousands of cases are thought to go undetected. Almost all patients with Parkinson’s disease will eventually need to take medication to help with their symptoms. Worldwide, there could be as many as 10,000,000 cases of PD. By 2025, PD drug sales are expected to double; sales estimates by 2025 are expected to crest $6.0 billion. The country with the highest- diagnosed prevalence of PD is the U.S. PD tends to be a disease of men, with a nearly 2:1 ratio of men:women among patients diagnosed with this disease. A particular challenge to the treatment of Parkinson’s patients are their comorbidities, which include arthritis, cardiovascular disease, psychosis and dementia. The future market for treatment is believed to be robust, with the compound

annual growth rates of 2.7% and 1.8% for patients that are diagnosed and not diagnosed respectively. We expect those growth rates to continue for the foreseeable future. In the U.S. market, patients currently expend $15,000 to $25,000 per year to treat the symptoms of PD, creating a multi-billion-dollar opportunity for disease-modification of this devastating disease. Moreover, since the same product would be used to treat PD and its GI complications, we believe we have multiple opportunities to achieve commercial success in several treatment areas in this market.
 c-Abl inhibition as a treatment focus in PD and related diseases.
 PD is a progressive disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, difficulty in walking and an inability to maintain one’s posture or keep oneself from falling.1, 2 Pathologically, PD is characterized by degeneration of neurons in an area of the brain near the brainstem, coupled with the clumping and accumulation of misfolded proteins in cell bodies known as Lewy bodies (LBs)3, 4, 5. The clinical and pathologic features of PD affect other areas of the brain in addition to the brainstem, resulting in a widespread pathology that is not adequately controlled with dopamine-replacement (i.e. levodopa) therapy.6 Manifestations of PD include falling, freezing, neuropsychiatric disorders, GI complications, sensory problems, and cognitive impairment with dementia.6 PD is initiated by a dysfunctional protein known as alpha-synuclein. In its dysfunctional form, alpha-synuclein is aggregated and likely to be misfolded, which alters its physiological properties in the body. Dysfunctional alpha-synuclein, when taken up by a neuron, starts a cascade of events that are illustrated in Fig. 1.
 
Fig. 1: The Biochemistry of Parkinson’s Disease Initiation and Progression and How to Disrupt It
 A. The process of neurodegeneration. Misfolded α-synuclein can arise from a variety of factors (see text). Misfolded α-synuclein may form within the neuron or by transfer through cell surface receptors or by crossing membrane bilayers. Within a neuron, misfolded α-synuclein is ‘sensed’ and c-Abl activated, driving the formation of pathologic α-synuclein by chemical modification (p-Syn). Chemical modification creates a form of α-synuclein that represents the pathologic species of the disease leading to disruption of mitochondrial integrity, negatively impact the endosome, disrupt nucleosomal structure and modulate transcription of certain genes. C-Abl also inactivates parkin by chemical modification, which affects mitochondrial quality control and suppresses protein clearance mechanisms. Parkin inactivation suppresses the complex interplay between parkin and pink1 at the mitochondrion, which act in concert to maintain mitochondrial integrity, quality and regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. Parkin inactivation leads to the accumulation of toxic parkin substrates PARIS (PARkin Interacting Substrate), aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) and far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FBP1), (AIMP2) and far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FBP1). PARIS and AIMP2 accumulate in adult conditional parkin knockout mice and MPTP-intoxicated mice as well as in patients with PD. Increased levels of PARIS can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction through down-regulation of PGC-1α and loss of DA neurons in a PARIS-dependent manner. Over expression of AIMP2 leads to an age-dependent, selective degeneration of DA neurons through activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), driving PARP1-mediated parthanatos. This suggests that PARIS and AIMP2 may be important contributors to the loss of DA neurons and possibly other vulnerable neurons following parkin inactivation. Inactivation of parkin also disrupts protein clearance mechanisms through autophagy, lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways.
B. The consequences of c-Abl inhibitor treatment on the process of neurodegenerative disease. Inhibition of c-Abl precludes c-Abl activation, blocking the build-up of toxic parkin substrates PARIS and AIMP2 and terminating downstream events. This also re-establishes normal mitochondrial quality control and biogenesis. Model studies demonstrate that modified and unmodified α-synuclein aggregates are shunted to lysosomal or proteasomal degradation pathways for clearance with concomitant recovery of motor function.

We believe that we can succeed in developing therapies that will slow or stop PD and related disorders because we and our collaborators have characterized the pathways in Fig. 1. We believe the Abelson tyrosine kinase, or c-Abl, acts as a checkpoint on the pathway driving neurodegeneration. The steps on the pathway illustrated in Fig. 1 have been validated in multiple contexts and multiple organ systems and by reproducing parts of these results in preclinical animal models in three independent laboratories. Drawing from this knowledge, we believe inhibition of c-Abl will block the events downstream of c-Abl in these pathways and modify disease for PD and other alpha-synuclein related disorders.
 IkT-148009 for neurodegenerative disease

1) ‘Clinical Development’ progress bars represent the current state of the indicated programs. Blue arrows represent completed or in progress studies; white arrows represent planned approaches for future clinical studies.
 
(2) Four indications will be pursued for IkT-148009 in PD, which will be pursued through two INDs, one focused on treatment in the brain in treatment naïve or early-stage patients and the second focused on GI complications. MSA is a Parkinson’s-like disease to enter clinical development at Phase 2 sharing the Phase 1 data for 148009 with PD. We will move MSA forward in clinic trials only if ongoing animal model studies yields positive results.

(3) For biomarker status, ‘Validated’ refers to proof of target engagement in the target tissue which has been performed using rodent tissues and fluids. We are currently developing methods for using clinical samples for validating our ability to confirm target engagement in patients. ‘Validating’ in this context indicates ongoing efforts to prove target engagement using proprietary sources and methods under development from human tissues and fluids. Target engagement measures if and to what extent a compound occupies its target. ‘Can be used for patient selection’ refers to our ability to use one or more markers we are currently ‘Validating’ to screen patients for the presence of that marker as a means of defining the patients most likely to benefit from the proposed treatment.
 IkT-148009 is a small molecule, brain penetrant c-Abl inhibitor selective for the non-receptor Abelson tyrosine kinases that we are using in clinical trials to treat two groups of PD patients and two additional groups to evaluate GI complications that arise early in the disease course in PD patients. We delineate the GI complications from PD because we will evaluate the GI complications using unique measurements and endpoints that are distinct from PD itself. Thus, we believe we will have four opportunities to succeed with IkT-148009, lowering the risk of failure during the development program. A fifth program for IkT-148009 involves the orphan disease Multiple System Atrophy, which we discuss further below. We believe we have further lowered the risks associated with development of IkT-148009 because we believe key aspects of the underlying pharmacology of IkT-148009 have been shown to be superior to approved drugs in this class. The five indications to which IkT-148009 are planned to be applied are listed in Table 1.
 Validated animal models recreate the rate of progression and severity of the human disease
 To establish whether IkT-148009 could impact the disease course in PD and related disorders, it was necessary to recreate the human disease in animals for both the location in the body where the disease occurs and for the timeframe of disease progression relative to lifespan. In patients, PD often takes 25 years to lead to death, approximately 1/3 of the average human lifespan in the United States. One-third of the lifespan of a mouse is one year. Thus, to create a true mimic of the human disease, we introduced dysfunctional synuclein aggregates into the mouse brain at the nigrostriatal region near the brainstem, or in the GI tract, and then let the disease slowly- progress. The outcomes of these studies have recently been published.


Efficacy of IkT-148009 in validated, humanized mouse models of PD and related disorders
 1. Functional Reversal in the Brain. 
 About 10% of human PD arises from a genetic defect that leads to inherited disease. One of these inherited defects is the Alanine-to-Threonine mutation at position 53 (A53T) in alpha-synuclein. A53T can be introduced into mouse brain using an adeno-associated vector (AAV vector) that is injected using MRI guidance to place the expression vector for A53T into the nigrostriatal region of mouse brain, the same region of the brain where PD occurs in human patients. Disease in this model develops over a 6-month period to degenerate 50% of dopamine-secreting (DA) neurons, mimicking the time frame of 50% neurodegeneration in this part of the brain of PD patients. We introduce A53T in just one hemisphere of the mouse brain, so we can use the other brain hemisphere as an internal control. Mice with 50% neurodegeneration in just one hemisphere lose the ability to walk in straight lines, so we measure functional loss and recovery by counting circles traversed by the mice in a fixed period of time.
 Six weeks after introduction of A53T, 1x/day dosing of IkT-148009 was initiated. Functional readout was performed with the amphetamine-rotation test at 6 months of age. Dosing with IkT-148009 resulted in nearly complete restoration of normal function in this test, indicating that IkT-148009 reversed functional loss in the brain.
 Functional reversal is accompanied by halting neurodegeneration and rescue of affected neurons in response to treatment. That we have achieved this outcome can be appreciated from counting the number of neurons in the affected region of the brain using two different staining procedures as well as by measuring the density of neural fibers in the affected region of the brain.7 The neurons were counted using two different markers of dopaminergic neurons: Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) or Nissl. A) staining of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and B) quantitation of neural counts. While IkT-148009 did not have any effect on the number of neurons in control animals lacking A53T, induction of A53T resulted in a 75%-80% reduction of dopaminergic neurons 6 months following induction.7 By contrast, induction of A53T for 5 weeks, followed by initiation of IkT-148009 treatment by daily oral gavage preserved most dopaminergic neurons (> 80%).7
 To demonstrate target engagement in the brain following oral, 1x/day administration, the ability of IkT-148009 to suppress activation of c-Abl can be measured by quantifying the suppression of the active form of c-Abl, which is autophosphorylated at Tyr245. In the presence of 50 mg/kg/day IkT-148009, the ratio of the active:inactive form of c-Abl in the brain returns to levels below baseline in these animals.7 In the presence of the efflux transporter inhibitor, slightly better inhibition of c-Abl activation is observed.
 
2. Functional preservation in an acute neurotoxicity model in the brain.
 This pre-clinical model uses a chemical neurotoxin, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine), to stimulate c-Abl activation in the absence or presence of IkT-148009.7 In this model, IkT-148009 substantially protects neurons from degradation as we have recently published.7 IkT-148009 treatment in this model blocked nearly all of the neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain from degradation induced by MPTP, the region of the brain normally affected by PD.
 The degree of neuroprotection arising from IkT-148009 in this acute model is also reflected in the functional behavior of these animals.7 In forelimb and grip strength, mice treated with IkT-148009 are nearly identical to control mice that have not been treated with the acute neurotoxin MPTP. These animals also have nearly normal descent times in the ‘pole test’, a test in which the mice are placed at the top of a two-meter pole and have to navigate their way vertically down the pole.7
 
3. Functional Reversal in the GI Tract
 GI dysfunction is among the most prevalent early signs of PD, usually involving irreversible constipation, difficulty emptying stomach contents (known as gastroparesis) and difficulty swallowing (known as dysphagia). To evaluate the ability of IkT-148009 to induce functional reversal in the GI tract, a transgenic mouse was created to express A53T specifically in the GI tract. Animals expressing A53T in the GI tract display a significant slowing in the time it takes for food to be processed from mouth to anus, known as the Whole Gut Transit Time, or WGTT. A53T mice display a nearly 3-fold slowing in WGTT relative to regular mice 3 months after A53T is expressed in the adult mouse (Fig. 2). While normal mice have a WGTT of just 165 minutes, this lengthens to nearly 500 minutes 3 months after A53T is introduced (Fig. 2). Mice treated with just 50 mg/kg/day beginning two months after A53T was introduced, on the other hand, have an average WGTT of just 219 min. If it weren’t for the 6 outlier measurements (see cluster plot with blue shading to the right), the average for drug treated mice would be closer to 170 min, a nearly completely normal transit time.

Fig. 2: The Whole Gut Transit Time (WGTT) measured in A53T and wild type human alpha-synuclein transgenic mice in the presence or absence of IkT-148009. The WGTT was measured after 3 months at either 50 or 150 mg/kg/day in mice expressing A53T-alpha-synuclein (only 50 mg/kg/day is shown, 150 mg/kg/day had similar results with an average of 254 min instead of 219 min). The control mice were a dosing solution, or vehicle, without the drug. The control allowed comparison of drug treated mice to mice that express the normal human alpha-synuclein as the only source of alpha-synuclein in their bodies. For each treatment group, the results were statistically significant relative to the no drug vehicle only treated controls with a P < 0.0001 in a Student’s T-test.
 When we evaluate the distribution of toxic alpha-synuclein in the gut, which we track with an antibody against pY39, therapeutic treatment with IkT-148009 results in near clearance of pathological alpha-synuclein, evidenced by the loss of punctate green staining in the images at both 50 and 150 mg/kg treatment (Fig. 3). Thus, functional reversal in the gut is accompanied by clearance of toxic alpha-synuclein as a consequence of IkT-148009 treatment.
 
Fig. 3: Effect of IkT-148009 on the presence of pathological pY39 in the adult myenteric plexus of the PD A53T-a-syn mouse model. Fixed longitudinal muscle containing myenteric plexus (LM-MP) tissue from the A53T-a-syn transgenic mice from the three cohorts Vehicle, or the drug IkT-148009 at two different concentrations, 50 mg/Kg and 150 mg/Kg were immunostained with antibodies against pY39 (Rabbit Polyclonal; Green) and VaCht (Goat polyclonal; Red) and with appropriate secondary antibodies. The tissues were then mounted with Prolong Anti-fade and imaged under oil with 40X magnification with an Olympus FV3000rs confocal microscope. The VaCht labels all adult myenteric neurons that express the neurotransmitter and their populations account for almost 70% of adult myenteric neurons. Using the VaCht immunostaining to focus on the myenteric ganglia, we imaged the z-plane that focuses on the myenteric ganglia in the LM-MP tissues and used that plane to observe the presence of pY39 within the myenteric ganglia. Our representative images here show that the expectedly punctate immunostained pY39 protein is abundantly present in and around the neurons of the myenteric ganglia of the Vehicle-dosed A53T mice. However, both the low (50 mg/Kg) and high (150 mg/ Kg) dose of the drug IkT-148009 nearly clears the presence of this pathological protein within the myenteric ganglia and their individual neurons.


We believe that these results in preclinical models establish that reversal of functional loss occurs in the gut just as it has been established in the brain. Functional recovery occurs relatively quickly in the gut, in less than four weeks of daily dosing, although we have not withdrawn drug after functional reversal to determine if treatment with IkT-148009 is curative. However, it is unknown whether these effects will be seen in humans following treatment with IkT-148009.
 Toxicology of IkT-148009 in rat and monkey
 We have completed 14-day, 3-month and 6-month toxicology studies in rats and 14-day, 3-months and 9-months toxicology studies in monkey. These studies reveal that IkT-148009 has less toxicological impact inthese animals for these durations relative to the template molecule imatinib. In long-term toxicology in rat, IkT-148009 had a No Adverse Event Level, or NOAEL, of 15 mg/kg/day as compared to 5 mg/kg/day for imatinib. Similarly, the NOAEL for monkey at 9 months was 75 mg/kg/day for IkT-148009 as compared to 15 mg/kg/day for the template drug imatinib. The only unexpected observation was the emergence of minimal to mild pathology in the eyes of rats that was not observed in the 9-month study in monkeys. Beginning at 13 weeks, a progressive increase in the frequency of changes to the structures of the eye was observed in rat. These changes included minimal to mild retinal degeneration, partial retinal detachment and evidence of choroid neovascularization, indicating that a monitoring program should be deployed in clinical studies to determine if these changes in the eye may occur in humans. Despite these observations in the eyes of rats, we observed a reduction in the overall toxicology profile of IkT-148009 as the dosing duration increased, suggesting that as the dosing duration is lengthened, there is an adaptation that occurs in different organ systems in response to drug treatment.

 Demographics and Adverse Events Observed in Clinical Studies to Date
 IkT-148009 has been administered to older and elderly healthy adults in Single and Multiple Ascending Dose studies in humans (SAD and MAD, respectively) with up to 7-day dosing. IkT-148009 has also been administered in Parkinson’s patients with mild to moderate disease who remained on symptomatic therapies and received IkT-148009 for up to 7-days. The tables below summarize the demographics of the healthy subjects evaluated in the SAD and MAD studies.

72 patients were evaluated in the SAD phase from 12.5 to 325 mg (8 patients/cohort, 3:1 randomized to placebo). 16 healthy subjects were evaluated in the MAD phase with 7-day dosing at 12.5 or 25 mg. 14 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn & Yahr < 3.0) who remained on Parkinson’s medications were evaluated at 50 mg or 100 mg MAD with 7-day dosing. 11 patients with untreated Parkinson’s disease (Hoehn & Yahr < 3.0) were evaluated at 50, 100 or 200 mg dosed for up to 11 weeks. Across all 113 healthy subjects or Parkinson’s patients who have participated in trials to date, no clinically significant adverse events were observed at any dose or dose duration (Tables 3). No cardiovascular adverse events that were related to IkT-148009 were observed, to include no QTcF prolongation in either male or female subjects. The unblinded, complete adverse event profiles appear in Tables 3. Of 20 total adverse events that occurred in healthy subjects or Parkinson’s patients, 17 occurred in subjects or patients treated with active drug, none of clinical significance. Of 8 adverse events seen in untreated Parkinson’s patients with up to 11 weeks dosing (Table 3), two adverse events in a single patient with amylase and lipase laboratory abnormalities were screened to be normal but had elevated values at baseline (pre-dose) and increased to higher levels at the 4 week visit. A second patient experienced gastric pain nausea on first dosing that did not re-occur over 4 weeks.
No serious adverse events have been observed in healthy subjects or Parkinson’s patients at any dose or dosing duration.

Pharmacokinetics in Humans
 
Clinical pharmacokinetics of single doses of IkT-148009 are summarized in Figure 7.
 

Figure 3: Clinical Pharmacokinetics of IkT-148009 in SAD
 
In the SAD study, IkT-148009 showed linear dose proportionality as the dose escalated to 175 mg, but plateaued at 250 mg and 325 mg. The half-life of IkT-148009 averaged 23-25 hours, with a Cmax reaching 6130 ng/mL at 175mg and the AUC0-inf reaching 170,000 ng-h/mL. These exposures are deemed to be very high. Multiple dose PK demonstrated a 2-fold accumulation in elderly healthy subjects, with steady-state reached between days 4 and 5. Parkinson’s patients, on the other hand, displayed a 1.3 to 1.4-fold accumulation at day 7 and doubling of the dose from 50 to 100 mg resulted in only a 30-40% increase in drug exposure evaluated by Cmax or AUC0-24h at steady-state.
 Clinical experience in Parkinson’s Patients
 Fourteen patients have been dosed at 50 mg or 100 mg IkT-148009 over 7-days once daily (6 active, 2 placebo at 50 mg and 5 active and one placebo at 100 mg). As for healthy subjects of the same age, IkT-148009 appeared to be well-tolerated (Table 3). One case of dermatitis emerged on the first day of dosing in a patient given 50 mg. The dermatitis was treated medically and no reoccurrence was noted nor was dosing disrupted. In Parkinson’s patients, one instance of diarrhea and one instance of constipation were observed post dosing. Pharmacokinetics of IkT-148009 in patients suggested the drug was less well absorbed (≈ 40% less) compared to a comparable dose in older healthy subjects as the steady state exposure from 50 mg to 100 mg was less than dose proportional (1.4:1), but exhibited the same half-life with a similar distribution volume and clearance rate.
 Eight patients with untreated Parkinson’s disease have been dosed at 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg for up to 11 weeks. Longer duration of dosing did not result in a more frequent occurrence in laboratory abnormalities or adverse events; amylase and lipase elevations in patients dosed up to 11 weeks were observed in only a single patient.
 Clinical Development Going Forward
 IkT-148009 restarted its ‘201’ trial in patients with untreated Parkinson’s disease following lifting of the FDA full clinical hold in January 2023. The full clinical hold was issued November 7, 2022, following review of our IND submission to expand use of IkT-148009 to MSA; the IND submission cross-referenced all of the IkT-148009 data in Parkinson’s disease, leading to the hold being applied across all the IkT-148009 programs. The FDA lifted the hold for the application of IkT-148009 in Parkinson’s in January 2023 and in MSA in March 2023. The 201 trial has restarted with two doses at 50 mg and 100 mg initially while we also measure the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile IkT-148009 at 200 mg in 6 healthy volunteers age 45-70. Upon completion of the 200 mg healthy volunteer study in March 2023 and if no safety concerns arise, we will include the 200 mg dose in the 201 trial. Three untreated Parkinson’s patients were dosed at 200 mg for 2 weeks to 8 weeks prior to the trial being halted and none of these patients experienced a clinically meaningful adverse event, so we anticipate including the 200 mg dose into the 201 trial as soon as practicable. Figure 4 summarizes the design and outcome analysis planned for the 201 trial.

 In the gut, we will take a unique approach to seeking approval for the GI complications in PD patients. In the GI, prospective and retrospective data using a wireless motility capsule measuring WGTT, a battery of clinical assessment scores and potentially GI biopsies will be used to assess clinical benefit in the GI. The combination of these measures of GI function represents a new approach to evaluating neurological function in PD patients with GI complications. We believe these quantitative measures in the GI tract could facilitate proof-of-concept trials in the future and provide quantitative endpoints from measures in the GI that could augment analysis of trials in the future and provide quantitative endpoints from measures in the GI that could augment analysis of therapeutic benefit in the brain. Trial design and the number of patients we intend to enroll in such studies will be discussed with the FDA in follow-up meetings, to include agreement on the use of GI endpoints in analyzing therapeutic benefit.
 We believe simultaneous measures in the brain and GI tract offer an additional development advantage for us. The ability to restore normal GI function implies that PD patients may experience more normal bathroom and/or eating habits. We can think of no more fundamental improvement in quality of life than the ability to eat or to go to the bathroom normally, which is becoming a key metric of therapeutic benefit for PD.
 IkT-001Pro: Validating our prodrug technology in stable phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
 


Market and Commercial Opportunity
 IkT-001Pro is the first application of our prodrug technology that seeks to improve the oral absorption, reduce GI side effects and enhance the safety of active pharmaceutical ingredients. IkT-001Pro is a prodrug of the anti- cancer agent imatinib, an FDA approved treatment for certain blood and stomach cancers. We plan to seek approval from the FDA for IkT-001Pro in stable phase CML as an orphan indication. In 2016, imatinib became generic and up to eleven companies have been approved to sell generic imatinib in the U.S. In 2020, sales for generic imatinib were approximately $331 million per year across the retail counter, indicative of a potentially robust commercial market for IkT-001Pro. In non-human primates IkT-001Pro displayed a 3.4-fold higher NOAEL relative to Imatinib. This suggests that IkT-001Pro could reduce some side effects common to imatinib therapy for blood and stomach cancers in patients. As a consequence, we believe we have an opportunity to compete with generic imatinib sales in the U.S. market if IkT-001Pro completes clinical development and is approved by the FDA. To achieve this commercial goal, we will require implementation of an appropriate commercial strategy for prescribers, pharmacy benefit managers and payors. Primary research to validate our strategy with pharmacy benefit managers and payors suggests a commercial path exists, passing through generic imatinib. IkT-001Pro, if approved, could also compete for market share from other first line therapies for CML. One of the approved indications for Nilotinib (marketed as Tasigna®), for example, is for treatment of CML in patients that are imatinib intolerant. Nilotinib’s label indicates it has serious cardiovascular adverse events. For those patients whose imatinib-intolerance arises from on-dosing side effects, we believe they would elect to take IkT-001Pro might be viewed as an alternative therapy if IkT-001Pro is shown to relieve those side effects in clinical trials and approved by the FDA.
Development Strategy for IkT-001Pro
 CML is a proliferation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow with an incidence of 1 – 2 cases per 100,000 persons, and accounts for approximately 15% of newly-diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. Prevalence of this disease has steadily grown over the past decade, with nearly 200,000 patients projected to be afflicted with this disease by 2050. Pathogenesis of CML is linked to a mutation in the c-Abl gene, referred to as BCR-Abl. BCR-Abl is a form of the c-Abl protein kinase that is always in the “on” state, and accounts for excessive accumulation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood that is associated with leukemia. Inhibition of BCR-Abl with imatinib suppresses tumor growth. In clinical practice, imatinib is very successful at suppressing tumor growth with an 81% event-free survival rate and a 93% overall survival rate. However, 8-year follow-up studies revealed that only 55% of patients remained on therapy at 8 years, indicating that treatment failure grew over time. Treatment failures occur for a variety of reasons. We believe failure to adhere to the daily treatment regimen makes a significant contribution to treatment failure for imatinib therapy. For example, nearly 50% of patients experience nausea, diarrhea and vomiting that are not well managed. Missing just 5 days of therapy in the first 12 months of treatment reduces the likelihood of reaching cure at the end of the fourth year of treatment by nearly 25%. Thus, while imatinib remains the medication of choice for CML, we believe that GI distress and other on-dosing side effects of imatinib therapy degrade patient adherence and lead to substantial additional medical costs, which can reach $100,000 per patient in the U.S. One of the key objectives for IkT-001Pro is to restore all patients to 100% treatment compliance by suppression of the GI and other on-dosing side effects for both branded and generic imatinib.
 
Pharmacology of IkT-001Pro in preclinical models
 We believe many of the side effects that degrade adherence to imatinib therapy arise from GI distress on absorption, along with degradation that occurs at the gut wall (so-called first-pass metabolism). IkT-001Pro is a chemically modified form of imatinib, which is absorbed intact and enzymatically releases imatinib in the blood (Table 1). Evaluation of the prodrug absorption and distribution in rats demonstrated that the exposure to imatinib is significantly higher overall. We determine this by measuring the Area Under the Curve, or AUC, as illustrated in Table 6.

We have evaluated IkT-001Pro in a dose-range-finding study and in a pivotal 28-day GLP toxicology study in monkeys. One of the principal measurements we make in a toxicology study is the No Observed Adverse Event Level, or NOAEL. The NOAEL is the dosing level at which no meaningful toxicity is observed. For IkT-001Pro, the NOAEL is 5-fold higher for IkT-001Pro relative to imatinib given alone. The higher NOAEL means that the prodrug drug suppressed some side effects that normally arise from imatinib itself. In these studies, we observed that all the GI and other on-dosing side effects were suppressed at the NOAEL dose.
 
Efficacy of IkT-001Pro in preclinical animal models of leukemia
 We measured the efficacy of imatinib therapy versus the prodrug in a patient-derived model of leukemia by transferring the liquid tumor of a human patient into an immune-suppressed mouse, giving the mouse a human leukemia. When we compared the dose of IkT-001Pro in this animal model to the dose of imatinib required to observe the same effect, we determined that we could deliver 15% less imatinib than if we had dosed the animals with imatinib alone (Fig 5).9 We believe these results suggest that IkT-001Pro delivers imatinib into the body more efficiently than imatinib alone.
 

Fig. 9: Comparison of tumor control for imatinib and IkT-001Pro. 150 mg/kg imatinib or 155 mg/kg IkT-001Pro were dosed daily into 15 mice per group and compared to vehicle control. Dosing began on the 8th day after tumor cell inoculation into the tail vein with human, patient-derived leukemia cells, which could be followed with the cell surface marker CD45. As is readily apparent, tumor control by imatinib and IkT-001Pro were identical even though IkT-001Pro delivered 15% less imatinib relative to imatinib alone. This is due to the mass difference between imatinib and IkT-001Pro. These results confirm the observations made with respect to the AUC or drug exposure per unit mass of prodrug vs. imatinib alone.
 
Clinical Development Strategy for IkT-001Pro in stable phase CML
 Through pre-IND discussions with the FDA Division of Hematology, we believe approval of IkT-001Pro could be achieved through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The IND was filed in August 2022 and the Study May Proceed letter allowing clinical entry was received in September 2022. In this instance, clinical development prior to the New Drug Application meeting is a measure of bioequivalence, which began in mid-December 2022. Four cohorts will be measured at 300, 400, 500 and 600 mg IkT-001Pro freebase delivered as a combination of film-coated tablets of 100 mg or 400 mg strength. The 300 mg dose enrolled three healthy volunteers for a single dose of IkT-001Pro and measurement of the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile over 96 hours along with a batter of safety evaluations. PK evaluation from these three volunteers revealed that IkT-001Pro delivered the expected amount of the active ingredient imatinib, and no side effects or clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities or cardiovascular risks were observed. The 400, 500 and 600 mg IkT-001Pro freebase cohorts will involve eight healthy subjects in a single period crossover study wherein in all eight will first receive a single dose of the specified dose of IkT-001Pro, have blood drawn for PK measures and then ‘washout’ for seven days before receiving a single dose of commercial 400 mg imatinib mesylate. As for IkT-001Pro, the 96-hour PK blood samples will be drawn for PK analysis and comparison to the PK analysis of IkT-001Pro. The 300, 400 and 500 mg dose cohorts have been completed as of this writing.
 Upon completion of the 600 mg dose, the dose of IkT-001Pro equivalent to 400 mg imatinib mesylate will be computed from the PK data across all four cohorts and then a confirmatory study in 32 healthy volunteers will be performed in a two-period crossover study. In the two-period crossover study, 16 healthy subjects will first take Imatinib mesylate and the other 16 healthy subjects will be given the equivalent dose of IkT-001Pro. Following the 7-day washout, the subjects on 400 mg imatinib mesylate will switch to IkT-001Pro, while the subjects that were first administered IkT-001Pro will switch to 400 mg imatinib mesylate. If the confirmatory study validates the computed dose of IkT-001Pro equivalent to 400 mg imatinib mesylate, we will then request a meeting with the FDA to discuss the parameters for the New Drug Application or NDA. Coincident with that meeting, we plan to evaluate the safety benefit of IkT-001Pro in a superiority trial in existing patients on 400-mg imatinib mesylate to further validate the medical advantage of IkT-001Pro over standard-of-care 400 mg imatinib mesylate.

Clinical and Research Phase Programs in Other Neurological Diseases
 Our RAMPTM medical chemistry program has also identified additional development opportunities for other neurological diseases which includes Dementia with Lewy Body or DLB, and Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML.
 Dementia with Lewy Body (DLB)
 DLB is a Parkinson’s-like disease characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregates, c-Abl activation and alpha- synuclein aggregate chemical modification much like that found in Parkinson’s disease. DLB is diagnosed by observation of a progressive onset of cognitive impairment that may be followed by motor function deficits and characterized morphologically by widespread cortical and subcortical α-synuclein/ Lewy body plus ß-amyloid and tau pathologies. The clinical features of DLB include cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating attention. PD and DLB are both Lewy Body disorders. PD and DLB share many features as the disease progresses, and therefore it is not surprising that PD and DLB share the involvement of alpha-synuclein aggregates and c-Abl activation. Most striking about DLB versus PD, however, is that DLB often occurs concomitant with the pathology associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), suggesting a mechanistic linkage between Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease. While it is possible to distinguish PD from DLB in the clinic using diagnostic procedures, it is not possible to create independent pre-clinical models for DLB and for PD. Unlike other alpha-synuclein-related disorders, such as MSA, there are no animal models that permit evaluation of cognitive function with no motor dysfunction. Therefore, we are using the properties determined for IkT-148009 to screen additional molecules from the 148x series and evaluating pharmacokinetics in animals to identify candidate(s) from the 148x series that share brain penetration, toxicology and other characteristics that are similar with IkT-148009. The development of an animal model to assess the therapeutic utility in DLB is not necessary, because we believe the characteristics of a molecule suitable for treatment of DLB are similar to one used to treat PD given the significant overlap in disease pathology and clinical features. Rather, we are evaluating which of the 148x series molecules is the best candidate to follow IkT-148009 into the clinic and planning the pre-clinical studies, which will be required prior to evaluating the molecule clinically in patients with a formal diagnosis of DLB.
 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
 PML emerged as an unusual form of cognitive decline during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, arising from the migration and lytic infection of the John Cunningham virus, or JCV, from its reservoirs in the kidney and bone marrow not the brain. With the advent of antiretroviral therapy that restored normal immune responses to viral infection in patients with HIV infection, the first reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients since the era of the AIDS epidemic occurred during Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating natalizumab treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against α4ß1 and α4ß7 integrins that blocks lymphocyte surveillance in the brain and can prevent multiple sclerosis-related clinical relapses. The co-occurrence of PML and multiple sclerosis was unanticipated. Once JCV enters the CNS, JCV induces a lytic infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. The initial prevalence of natalizumab-associated PML in patients with multiple sclerosis was estimated to be 1 in 1000. However, as more PML cases emerged among natalizumab-treated patients, with substantial morbidity in survivors, the prevalence of PML among patients treated with natalizumab for more than 24 months who also carried antibody evidence of JCV infection and previous immunosuppressant exposure, climbed to at least 1 in 70. Analysis of polyomavirus infection and reproduction in host cells revealed that polyomaviruses like JCV are dependent on c-Abl for viral entry into the cells it is going to infect.10 This suggests to us that c-Abl inhibitors could be an effective anti-viral strategy to block productive JCV infection inside and outside of its reservoirs in a living organism.
 
Expertise and overall strategy
 We have assembled a team of principals and advisors with deep scientific, clinical, business and leadership experience and expertise in drug development that includes neurodegenerative diseases. Our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Milton H. Werner, Ph.D., is an internationally recognized scientist with a long history of conducting interdisciplinary research and executing on research programs in multiple therapeutic areas.
 Dr. Werner is a protein biochemist and structural biologist by training, enabling him and the team of principals and advisors we have assembled to develop and characterize a portfolio of novel c-Abl inhibitors and to rapidly determine their utility in a variety of model systems for specific diseases.

Dr. Werner is joined by Terence Kelly, Ph.D., a 20-year veteran of medicinal chemistry at Boehringer-Ingelheim, Roger Rush, Ph.D., who has led IND-enabling programs for ground-breaking medications, like the Hepatitis C compound portfolio of Idenix, which was sold to Merck & Co., and Dr. Surendra Singh who has extensive experience in process scale and commercial manufacturing of drug substances. We have engaged Clintrex Research Corporation, who is led by Karl Kieburtz, M.D. and Warren Olanow, M.D., two of the leading clinical investigators in neurodegenerative disease. Warren Olanow, MD is now the Company’s principal medical consultant. Andrew McGarry, MD (Clintrex) is our clinical trial medical monitor and our internal medical team running clinical operations, project planning and finance round out the Company’s expertise across all business disciplines. For more information regarding our management, see the section titled “Management”.
 Collaborations are central components of our strategy to build and advance our pipeline of product candidates. Through NIH research grants awarded to Dr. Werner, we have subcontracted research projects in the biochemistry of neurodegeneration to Johns Hopkins University, Arizona State University, the University of Bordeaux and the Vienna (Austria) Medical University. In oncology, we have subcontracted research work to the University of California, San Francisco and the CML Consortium and consult with clinicians at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Our research endeavors have been validated by private and public granting agencies, to include the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke, the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. We believe that accessing external innovation is important to our success and we plan to remain active in accessing external innovation through business development activities and awarding of private, state and federal grants through institutions such as NIH and DoD.
 Our leadership team is complemented by leading clinicians and research investigators in the areas of neurodegeneration (Drs. Ted Dawson, Valina Dawson, Ken Marek, Jay Pasricha, Jeff Kordower, Karl Kieburtz and C. Warren Olanow and Robert Hauser). We have active research collaborations with Dr. Jeffrey Kordower of Rush University and Dr. Jay Pasricha of Johns Hopkins University. Collectively, this group of collaborators and advisors represent what we believe is the cutting edge of the fields of neuroscience and neurodegeneration.
 Our strategy is guided by three principles:
 •Identification and characterization of the pathway(s) governing neurodegenerative disease: We select our therapeutic targets by identification and characterization of disease pathways that we believe drive neurodegenerative disease and elucidate the biochemistry of pathway proteins to enable small molecule targeting to treat PD and related disorders, often involving clinically validated targets.
 •Proprietary method of drug discovery in neurodegeneration: We use our RAMPTM method to imprint the properties we desire from an approved medication onto a new molecular entity for treatment inside and outside of the brain. Using RAMPTM, we believe we can establish the pharmacology profile of our product candidates using an existing medication as a template.
 •Delivering neurodegenerative treatments as a prodrug to improve pharmacology and safety: A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized by the body into a pharmacologically active drug. Our prodrug technology has been shown in animal models to suppress GI and other adverse events commonly associated with oral kinase inhibitors and improve drug absorption from the GI tract. We believe this technology enhances drug distribution into the target tissues, which we believe may improve safety and tolerability of our kinase inhibitors for neurodegenerative and other diseases. We must demonstrate any safety benefit using this prodrug technology in clinical trials in collaboration and consultation with the FDA.
 We believe that the application of these principles will significantly increase the probability of our success and will shorten the time required to bring effective therapeutics to patients with neurodegenerative and other diseases.
 Drug discovery and Delivery Technologies
 Engineering Small Molecule Brain Delivery
 Our RAMPTM drug discovery program used imatinib as a template to design and discover a family of novel chemical entities with high potency against c-Abl, leading to IkT-148009. We showed in preclinical models that a subset of the molecules that we discovered using RAMPTM were more brain penetrant than imatinib. We believe the specific modifications in the more brain penetrant RAMPTM molecules sterically hinder engagement of transporters that could suppress accumulation of drug in the brain. Thus, we believe RAMPTM could be further applied to predicting and developing next generation molecules with enhanced brain penetration without compromise of c-Abl inhibition. As part of our ongoing research and development effort, we have increased the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier by as much as 5-fold in preclinical models, enabling direct treatment in the brain following oral administration.
 

Enhance drug absorption through a prodrug technology
 In addition to the design principles, we have deployed to develop c-Abl inhibitors capable of maintaining therapeutic concentrations in the brain, we have also developed a delivery technology that suppresses GI side effects that occur on dosing with medications in this class. Using the anti-cancer agent imatinib as a prototype, we believe that we have shown that formation of a carbonate-linked prodrug enables absorption of the active ingredient without induction of GI side effects, resulting in an increase in the NOAEL by 3.4-fold relative to imatinib alone in non-human primates. The active ingredient we believe is more efficiently absorbed into the blood using this approach, which results in achieving therapeutic exposures with less drug administered. Since GI side effects can be common for drugs in this class and often discourage adherence to therapy, we believe this approach could be applied to any of the drugs we currently are developing for treatment of CNS disease and could be used to improve existing therapeutics in cancer as differentiated generics.
 
History of Business Operations and Key Events
 
We commenced operations in September 2008 as a Georgia limited liability company with in-licensed intellectual property relating protein kinase inhibitors to the control of bacterial and viral infectious diseases. By 2015, we had developed our own portfolio of protein kinase inhibitors to treat bacterial and viral infections, including viral infections in the brain. During 2015, we also began our endeavors in developing product candidates for other diseases of the brain, including neurodegeneration. In 2020, we completed an Initial Public Offering ("2020 IPO") and listed our Common Stock on Nasdaq under the symbol ‘IKT’. Key recent operational and financing milestones are:
 •In March 2017, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, awarded us an additional $2,000,000 to continue our development of small molecule therapeutics to treat JCV infection in the brain.
 •In March 2017, the Michael J. Fox Foundation awarded us $433,729 to screen our novel c-Abl protein kinase inhibitors in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease.
 •In June 2017, we believe we came to an understanding with the FDA on the requirements for approval for IkT-001Pro, a prodrug of imatinib, for the treatment of stable-phase patients with CML using a product with a potential for significant reduction of side effects under the FDA 505(b)(2) regulations.
 •In September 2017, the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, awarded us $3,108,583 to advance our novel c-Abl inhibitors as disease modifying therapies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders.
 •In March 2018, we opened our pre-IND discussion with the FDA for the application of our novel c-Abl inhibitor IKT-148009 for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
 •In September 2018, the National Cancer Institute, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, awarded us $2,002,000 to advance IkT-001Pro into the clinic as a novel therapy to treat stable-phase CML.
 •In September 2018, the FDA designated IkT-001Pro as an Orphan Drug for treatment of stable-phase CML.
 •In February 2019, we submitted two INDs for the application of IkT-148009 in neurodegenerative disease to the FDA. One IND was for treatment of Parkinson’s disease and the second IND is for the treatment of GI complications in Parkinson’s patients
 •In March 2019, the FDA cleared the first IND in human study to commence in elderly healthy volunteers for IkT-148009. First dosing of patients for treatment of PD commenced on February 16, 2021. Clinical development of IkT-148009 for the GI complications in PD patients will cross-reference the first human study of IkT-148009 for the treatment of PD.
 •In September 2019, the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, awarded us $3,100,838 to further advance our novel c-Abl inhibitor IkT-148009 into chronic pivotal toxicology studies for Parkinson’s disease and related disorders.
 •In December 2020, we completed an Initial Public Offering of 1,800,000 shares of our Common Stock for $10.00 per share.
 •In February 2021, we initiated dosing of IkT-148009 in a Phase 1 trial enrolling older and elder healthy volunteers to measure the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of our drug in patients of a similar age range as Parkinson’s patients.
 •In April 2021, we accelerated our Phase 1 trial to initiate Multiple Ascending Dose cohorts and began the process of incorporating Parkinson’s patients into these dosing cohorts.


•In June 2021, we completed a follow-on offering of 15,000,000 shares of our Common Stock for $3.00 per share.
 •In September 2021, we were awarded $385,888 from the National Institutes of Health to evaluate our novel c-Abl inhibitor IkT-148009 in an animal model of Multiple System Atrophy

 •In August 2022, we filed our IND application for IkT-001Pro to commence clinical development for the treatment of Stable-phase CML
 •In September 2022, we filed our IND application for the application of IkT-148009 to commence clinical development of IkT-148009 in Multiple System Atrophy (“MSA”)
 •In November 2022, we received a full clinical hold from the FDA on IkT-148009 programs in PD and MSA
 •In December 2022, we filed our Complete Response to the clinical hold on IkT-148009 in PD with the U.S. FDA.
 •In January 2023, we received notice of the lifting of the clinical hold on IkT-148009 in PD.
 •In January 2023, we raised gross proceeds of $10,000,000 through the sale of our Common Stock and Common Stock equivalents and warrants.
 •In March 2023, we received notice of the lifting of the clinical hold on IkT-148009 in MSA.
 
Regulatory and Clinical Experiences
 From September 2014 through September 2016, we conducted two non-interventional clinical studies to inform our research on the risk, development, and treatment of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, or PML. The results of one of the studies was published in the Journal of Neurovirology.11 In 2016, the FDA permitted protocols allowing us to conduct clinical trials with the use of non-Inhibikase marketed products to treat PD. We did not conduct these studies based on our decision to pursue development of IkT-148009. In February 2021, we began our Phase 1 trial of IkT-148009 in older and elderly healthy volunteers to initiate clinical development of our lead candidate for Parkinson’s and related disorders, which advanced into Phase 2a studies in 2022. In October 2022, an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to expand use of IkT-148009 into the Parkinson’s-related disease MSA was filed with the FDA. On November 7, 2022, following review of the IND for IkT-148009 as a treatment for MSA, the FDA notified the Company that it was placing the IkT-148009 programs for Parkinson’s disease and MSA on clinical hold. The FDA lifted the full clinical hold in January 2023 for the Parkinson’s programs and in March 2023 for the MSA program.
 Also in 2022, we commenced clinical development of IkT-001Pro.
 
Federal Contracts and Grants
 We have secured a number of grants from the United States Federal Government through the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. These grants supported most of the funding needed for our historical research and development activities. Funding through grants is nondilutive to our equity and does not need to be repaid, so long as we comply with the conditions of the grant. In connection with Federal government funding, the government retains ‘march-in’ rights in connection with these grants, which is a non-exclusive right to practice inventions developed from the grant funding. As we conduct our business in the future, we may expect to seek and use additional NIH funding through grant opportunities. No assurance can be given that we will obtain any grants that may be available within our areas of research and development.
 Since 2009, we have received six grants from the NIH totaling $10,053,365, to support the development of the RAMPTM drug discovery process and the application of the output of RAMPTM to therapeutic indications in neurodegenerative disease and infectious disease. Since 2017, we have received two grants from the NIH totaling $2,286,778, to support the development of the Company’s prodrug platform and oncology applications. Since 2021 we received one grant from NIH totaling $385,888 to support our evaluation of IkT-148009 in an animal model of MSA. Under these NIH grants, we must disclose to the Federal government the research methods and outcomes of our research endeavors and patent rights and are subject to the government’s march-in rights as they relate to intellectual property. As part of our reporting requirement, we must conduct independent audits of expenditures and file the outcomes of these audits with the NIH and the Department of Health and Human Services. These grants do not carry a payback provision unless there is a material breach or other transgression as it relates to use of funds. To date, we have not been found to have breached the terms of any NIH grant.

We have received one contract from the Department of Defense, or DoD, totaling $7,129,614, to develop so-called Medical Counter Measures, or MCMs, to attempt to establish whether currently marketed inhibitors of c-Abl could act as multi-pathogen anti-infectives for bioterrorism defense. Under the terms of the DoD contract, the Company may file intellectual property related to the outcomes of the research endeavor subject to the government’s march-in rights. The expenditures incurred under this contract were subject to annual audits by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, and compliance with federal regulations by the Defense Contract Management Agency, or DCMA.
We have received economic development grants and loans totaling $455,550 through the Georgia Research Alliance, or GRA, a not-for-profit entity of the State of Georgia. Under the terms of these grants and loans, we had to in-license intellectual property from a State of Georgia research university, such as Emory University, and attempt to translate this intellectual property into a useful medical product. As part of the terms and conditions of these grants and loans, the Company had to meet certain development milestones or establish that the in-licensed technology could not lead to a useful medical product. We complied with all of the terms of these grants and loans. The GRA loans could further be converted into company stock, based on the fair market value of our common stock at the time of conversion. GRA elected to convert the outstanding amount on its two loans on May 31, 2018 into 47,318 shares of our Common Stock.
 Material Agreements
 
Sphaera Pharma Pte. Ltd.
 On March 2, 2012, we entered into a collaborative research and development agreement, or the Sphaera Agreement, with Sphaera Pharma Pte. Ltd., or Sphaera, to collaborate on the development of the prodrug technology to be applied to protein kinase inhibitors for oncology and non-oncology indications. Under the terms of the Sphaera Agreement, each party would retain its pre-existing intellectual property, but any intellectual property conceived or reduced to practice under and certain results arising from the Sphaera Agreement would be assigned to us. On October 5, 2012, we and Sphaera amended the Sphaera Agreement to reflect joint patent applications in the U.S. and India by us and Sphaera for a series of novel compounds. While the underlying intellectual property would be jointly owned, we have the exclusive right to commercialize thirteen of the twenty-four linkers detailed in the filed patent applications, collectively, the Company Compounds, including the linker attached to imatinib that comprises the IkT-001Pro oncology product, with the remaining nine linkers owned by Sphaera, collectively, the Sphaera Compounds. Sphaera has the right to develop the Company Compounds for oncology indications but may not commercialize the Company Compounds unless we abandon the Company Compounds. We have notified Sphaera that we do not intend to abandon the Company Compounds. We do not currently have the right to develop the Sphaera Compounds. Additionally, if either party files an IND for a Company Compound that has been abandoned by the other party for an oncology indication in humans, the non-filing party is prohibited from developing such Company Compound. However, only we have the right to commercialize a Company Compound unless we formally abandon our interests.
 The prosecution of patents related to the Company Compounds, which includes the prodrug technology, are the responsibility of the Company.
 As consideration for its services, Sphaera has received a fixed fee of $160,000 and is entitled to the following milestone payments upon achievement of specified milestones:
 

Milestone Event | Payment 
First dosing of patients in US Phase 1 trial . . . . . . . . . . . | $ 250,000 
US Phase 1 trial completion with endpoints met . . . . . . | 500,000 
US Phase 2 trial completion with endpoints met . . . . . . | 875,000

Total potential milestone payments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $5,625,000 

 
No milestone payments have been made to Sphaera, and the Company does not anticipate that any milestone payments will be made to Sphaera. Sphaera is also entitled to royalty payments of a percentage of annual net sales and sublicenses ranging in the mid-single digits for applicable products.
 

Other Agreements
 Consulting Agreements
 Our non-employee Directors, non-employee management and non-employee technical staff have signed multi- year consulting agreements that provide for protections of intellectual property, trade secrets and ensure consistent commitment to Company research and development activities. These agreements provide a scope of work, reimbursement for incurred costs of travel and equity compensation.
Clinical Research Organization Agreements
 Our clinical research organization partnership is with Cognitive Research Corporation, or CRC, through a Masters Services Agreement that includes medical, analytical and pharmacy support services along with clinical research management and data handling according to a statistical analysis plan, although CRC may not be retained for future trials depending on the needs of future individual programs. We use the Hassman Research Institute as a single clinical evaluation site which is managed by CRC and Inhibikase clinical development staff. Our clinical development team is formed, in part, by two physicians and a clinical research manager employed by Clintrex Research Corporation and under contract to us, who have specialized expertise in clinical trial development and execution for Parkinson’s Disease research.
 
cGMP Manufacturing
 Our chemical manufacturing organization is STA Pharmaceutical US LLC, a subsidiary of WuXi AppTec Co., Ltd., which is based in China and provides process scale development and production of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Formulation and finishing services are provided through contracts on an as-needed basis, including current Good Manufacturing Practice or cGMP manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients.
 
Sponsored Research Agreements
 We regularly enter into agreements with academic and research institutions under which the institution agrees to perform certain testing and research for us in exchange for incremental fee payments, or the Sponsored Research Agreements. These Agreements allow us to explore the potential utility of our compounds for therapeutic indications we wish to pursue. We have previously entered into Sponsored Research Agreements with Johns Hopkins, University of Massachusetts Medical School — Worcester Campus and Louisiana State University, Shreveport, and Arizona State University, collectively the Institutions. The scope of work of these Sponsored Research Agreements are derived from the associated grants, in which the sponsored project is a subcontract to the main grant in which the Company is the primary party and Dr. Werner is the principal investigator. Incremental fee payments are due to the Institutions on a monthly or quarterly basis, and certain payments depend on the completion by the Institutions of testing and research milestones. The Sponsored Research Agreements contain estimated completion dates which may be extended by written agreement of the parties. Each Sponsored Research Agreement may be terminated by either party on 30 days written notice, and upon termination we must reimburse the applicable Institution for all costs and reasonably incurred financial commitments, regardless of which party initiates the termination. Under the Sponsored Research Agreements, we retain all rights, title and interest in any information designated as purchaser property, as defined in the Sponsored Research Agreements. We own exclusively, and retain all right, title and interest in and to, our property provided as part of any Sponsored Research Agreement. Any and all of our property remains our sole property and will be used by an Institution solely in performing the research contemplated in the Sponsored Research Agreement. The relevant Institution retains all right, title and interest in and to its inventions, discoveries, material and improvements, that were in existence prior to execution of a Sponsored Research Agreement. The relevant Institution does not acquire rights in our compounds as a result of sponsored research. We are not required to license any rights related to our compounds as a result of sponsored research and we own the results of sponsored research without restriction on their use.
Manufacturing
 We believe it is important to our business and success to have a reliable, high-quality preclinical and clinical drug supply.
 We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing.
 We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates. We have established relationships with several CMOs, including AgNo Pharmaceuticals, LLC and PepTech Corporation, both in China, and we have contracted for cGMP manufacturing in the United States with STA Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of WuXi AppTec Co., Ltd., which is based in China. We have contracted solid dosage formulations of IkT-148009 and IkT-001Pro with STA Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. in China and with Emerson Pace Laboratories in the United States, respectively.


We do not currently need commercial manufacturing capacity. When and if this becomes relevant, we intend to evaluate both third-party manufacturers as well as building out internal capabilities and capacity. We may choose one or both options, or a combination of the two.
 
Commercialization Plan
 We do not currently have any approved drugs and we do not expect to have any approved drugs in the near term. Therefore, we have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing drugs. However, members of our board of directors have commercial experience and we have conducted a full commercial opportunity assessment for our lead product for PD in the U.S. market. We may develop one or all of our products and commercialize them ourselves, or we may license or form partnerships with other companies for commercialization of our products in the future.
Competition
 The pharmaceutical industries, including in the neurodegenerative disease field, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, strong competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
Our product candidates for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases will compete with approved treatments as well as other therapies that may be in clinical or preclinical development or that have yet to be discovered. Historically, approved treatments for PD and related neurodegenerative disorders treat the symptoms of such diseases rather than halting or slowing the progression of the disease. We are not in the business of treating symptoms of disease. We intend to halt or slow the progression of the disease, which is known as disease modification and our product candidates are intended to modify disease. We believe that our product candidates, if approved by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad, will compete with other potential therapies intended to halt or slow the progression of neurodegenerative disease that are being developed by a number of companies and institutions. Several large and specialty pharmaceutical companies, including Prothena Corporation plc, Roche Holdings AG, Biogen Inc., Neurimmune Holding AG, UCB S.A., Neuropore Therapies, Inc., Sanofi S.A., Novartis A.G. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. are developing potentially disease modifying therapeutics for PD and are in various stages of clinical trials. Denali Therapeutics Inc. and Prevail Therapeutics Inc. are pursing treatments for specific genetic defects that could prevent onset of disease or affect progression in Parkinson’s patients. In addition, a number of companies have developed c-Abl inhibitors for oncology and any one of them could be in possession of an inhibitor that could be used for clinical development for neurodegenerative diseases. These include Novartis AG, Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company, Boehringer- Ingelheim GmbH and GlaxoSmithKline plc. Two companies, Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd. (SPARC) and 1st Biotherapeutics, Inc., have initiated clinical studies with proprietary c-Abl inhibitors for PD using molecules initially developed for treatment of blood cancer(s). In addition, we believe Botox® coupled with physical therapy is being explored in physician-led trials for neurogenic constipation, but we are not aware of any formal development programs by other companies.
Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, processes and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek and maintain patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. We endeavor to patent or in-license technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we intend to use other means to protect our proprietary rights, including pursuing terms of marketing or data exclusivity, orphan drug status (if applicable), and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain territories, including the United States, Europe and Japan. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 For our product candidates, we generally pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use. However, given that the development of our technology and product candidates is at an early stage, our intellectual property portfolio with respect to certain aspects of our technology and product candidates is also at an early stage. As further described below, we have filed or intend to file patent applications on various product candidates for composition of matter and other aspects of our technology and product candidates, and as we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including protection for additional methods of use, formulation or manufacture.


We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Intellectual Property.”
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. The patent expirations reported below assume the patent is not rendered invalid or unenforceable by legal action and that all required fees are timely paid. In the United States, a patent may be entitled to Patent Term Adjustment for Patent Office delay. Where known, this has been included in the expiration dates described below. Further, in the United States, the patent term of a single patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension can only be obtained for patents covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our eligible products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
 All of our novel and in-licensed compounds were funded in whole or in part by the U.S. government and are therefore subject to federal march-in rights. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the U.S. government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the U.S. government to use the invention or to have others use the invention on its behalf, commonly referred to as march-in rights. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 As of February 1, 2023, our patent portfolio included: (i) eight issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States and (ii) eight issued foreign patents and seven pending foreign patent applications. Patents issuing from the applications in this portfolio, if granted, will expire between 2033 and 2037, not taking into account any potential patent-term adjustments or extensions that may be available in the future.
 One family of patents and applications covers compositions of matter for IkT-001Pro and related chemical compounds, as well as methods of using those compositions. This family includes two issued U.S. patents: U.S. Patent No. 9,487,500, which claims a genus of compounds including IkT-001Pro, and U.S. Patent No. 9,907,796, which claims methods of using a genus of compounds, including IkT-001Pro, to treat certain tumoral disease and certain infectious diseases. These U.S. Patents will expire between 2033 and 2034, not including any potential patent term extensions. This family does not include any pending patent applications in the U.S. Outside the U.S., this family includes issued patents in Europe, Japan, and Australia, and a pending patent application in Canada. Outside the U.S., patents issuing from the applications in this family, if granted, will expire in 2033, not taking into account any potential patent term adjustments or extensions that may be available in the future. This family of patents and applications is jointly owned by us and Sphaera. Under the terms of our agreement with Sphaera, described above under “— Material Agreements — Sphaera Pharma Pte. Ltd.” we have the exclusive right to commercialize certain compounds disclosed in these applications, including IkT-001Pro, for cancer treatments.
 Two families of patents and applications cover compositions of matter for IkT-148009 and IkT-01427, the IkT-148x portfolio, and methods of use relating to those compositions. Patents issuing from the applications in these families, if granted, will expire between 2036 and 2037, not taking into account any potential patent-term adjustments or extensions that may be available in the future. These families include six issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent applications. The issued U.S. patents, U.S. Patent No. 9,828,370, U.S. Patent No. 10,118,923, U.S. Patent No. 10,316,031, U.S. Patent No. 10,344,027, U.S. Patent No. 10,906,896, and U.S. Patent no. 11,407,747, will expire in 2036, not including any potential patent term extensions, and include claims that cover compositions of matter for IkT-148009 and IkT-01427, as well as claims that cover methods of using those compositions to treat certain cancers and certain infectious diseases. Outside the U.S., these families include issued patents in Japan and Australia, and pending patent applications in Japan, Australia, Canada, and Europe. These families are solely owned by us.


In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with cGCPs, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
 •payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a
 •REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.


Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to initiate.
Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific time frames to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminary evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 •Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity, to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.


The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP requirements.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.


In addition, products tested for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 
Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. In particular, the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or “FDORA” enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act on December 29, 2022, further directs FDA to specify conditions for post-approval studies for products approved under accelerated approval that may provide additional requirements and timelines for conducting such studies. FDORA also directs FDA to develop procedures for withdrawing a product’s accelerated approval on an expedited basis, which may also impact one or more of our products, if we are no longer able to continue to meet the requirements for accelerated approval.
 

505(b)(2) Pathway
 The 505(b)(2) new drug application (NDA) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) abbreviated drug approval pathway. The pathway was created by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, with 505(b)(2) referring to a section of the FDCA. The provisions of 505(b)(2) were created, in part, to help avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a previously approved (“reference” or “listed”) drug; the section gives the FDA express permission to rely on data not developed by the NDA applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A 505(b)(2) NDA contains full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information on the active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. The FDA may also require the applicant to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that such disease or condition affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record keeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments where such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.


Once an approval of a drug or medical device is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
 We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our operations include:
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value; 
 •federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent;
 •provisions of HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and 
 •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer.
Regulation Outside the United States
 To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.


To market our future products in the European Economic Area, or EEA (comprised of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 •The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Drug Designation
 In the EEA, a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in development. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 In the EEA, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a 10-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA or the member state competent authorities, cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization, for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigational plan.
 This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinical superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and its Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.


Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
 For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch- Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new molecular entity. A drug is a new molecular entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another

version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well.
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug prices are determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.


As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of March 14, 2023, we had six full-time employees, one part-time employee and five contractors, six of whom collectively comprise our management team. All but one of these individuals holds a Ph.D. or an M.D. Our employees and contractors are located in Lexington, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Atlanta, Georgia. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
 
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Atlanta, Georgia, where we lease a single corporate office. Additionally, we have approximately 4,200 square feet of office space in Lexington, Massachusetts which we use as office and conference spaces for our team, most of whom are based in the surrounding area. It is anticipated that these distinct facilities will meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any material litigation or legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
