ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 
Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Clarus Corporation (which may be referred to as the “Company,” “Clarus,” “we,” “our” or “us”), a company focused on the outdoor and consumer industries, is seeking opportunities to acquire and grow businesses that can generate attractive shareholder returns. The Company has substantial net operating tax loss carryforwards which it is seeking to redeploy to maximize shareholder value. Clarus’ primary business is as a leading developer, manufacturer and distributor of outdoor equipment and lifestyle products focused on the climb, ski, mountain, sport and skincare markets. The Company’s products are principally sold under the Black Diamond®, Sierra®, PIEPS® and SKINourishment® brand names through specialty and online retailers, distributors and original equipment manufacturers throughout the U.S. and internationally.
 
Through our Black Diamond, PIEPS, and SKINourishment brands, we offer a broad range of products including: high performance activity-based apparel (such as shells, insulation, midlayers, pants and logowear); rock-climbing footwear and equipment (such as carabiners, protection devices, harnesses, belay devices, helmets, and ice-climbing gear); technical backpacks and high-end day packs; trekking poles; headlamps and lanterns; gloves and mittens; and skincare and other sport-enhancing products. We also offer advanced skis, ski poles, ski skins, and snow safety products, including avalanche airbag systems, avalanche transceivers, shovels, and probes. Through our Sierra brand, we manufacture a wide range of high-performance bullets and ammunition for both rifles and pistols that are used for precision target shooting, hunting and military and law enforcement purposes.
 
Clarus Corporation, incorporated in Delaware in 1991, acquired Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (which may be referred to as “Black Diamond Equipment”) and Gregory Mountain Products, LLC (which may be referred to as “Gregory Mountain Products” or “Gregory”) in May 2010 and changed its name to Black Diamond, Inc. in January 2011. In July 2012, we acquired POC Sweden AB and its subsidiaries (collectively, “POC”) and in October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively, “PIEPS”).
 
On July 23, 2014, the Company completed the sale of certain assets to Samsonite LLC comprising Gregory Mountain Product’s business. On October 7, 2015, the Company sold its equity interests in POC.
 
On August 14, 2017, the Company changed its name from Black Diamond, Inc. to Clarus Corporation and its stock ticker symbol from “BDE” to “CLAR” on the NASDAQ stock exchange. On August 21, 2017, the Company acquired Sierra Bullets, L.L.C. (“Sierra” or “Sierra Bullets”). On November 6, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of SKINourishment, Inc. (“SKINourishment”).
 
On May 7, 2018, the Company announced a “modified Dutch auction” tender offer for Clarus’ common stock, as well as the preferred share purchase rights associated with such shares (collectively, the “Shares”). On July 11, 2018, the tender offer expired, following which the Company announced it would accept 417,237 Shares for purchase at a price of $8.00 per Share, for an aggregate cost of approximately $3,338,000, excluding fees and expenses.
 
On August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program of $0.025 per share of the Company’s common stock (the “Quarterly Cash Dividend”) or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis. In 2018, our total Quarterly Cash Dividends were $1,488,000.  On January 18, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on February 8, 2019 of the Quarterly Cash Dividend to the record holders of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on January 29, 2019.
 
Market Overview
 
Our primary target customers are outdoor-oriented consumers who enjoy active, outdoor-focused lifestyles. The users of our products are made up of a wide range of outdoor enthusiasts, including climbers, mountaineers, trail runners, skiers, backpackers and campers, competitive shooters, hunters and other outdoor-inspired consumers. We believe we have a strong reputation for style, quality, design, and durability in each of our core product lines.
 
As the variety of outdoor sports activities continue to grow and proliferate, and existing outdoor sports evolve and become ever more specialized, we believe other outdoor companies are failing to address the unique technical and performance needs of enthusiasts involved in such specialized activities. We believe we have been able to help address this void in the marketplace by seeking to leverage our user intimacy and improving on our existing product lines, by expanding our product offerings into new niche categories and products, and by incorporating innovative industrial design and engineering and performance tolerances into our products. We believe the credibility and authenticity of our brands expands our potential market beyond committed outdoor athletes to those outdoor generalist consumers who desire to lead active, outdoor-focused lifestyles.

Growth Strategies
 
Our growth strategies are to achieve sustainable, profitable growth organically while seeking to expand our business through targeted, strategic acquisitions. We intend to create innovative new products, increase consumer and retailer awareness and demand for our products, and build stronger emotional brand connections with consumers over time across a growing number of geographic markets.
Continue to Service and Grow Existing Accounts. We continue to seek to develop strong relationships with our key retail, distributor and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners through a mutual respect and admiration for the sports we serve. Through our various corporate initiatives, a focus on being easy to do business with, the extension of our existing product portfolios, and an emphasis on quality, on-time deliveries, brand awareness and marketing, we plan to grow our existing accounts as well as foster new relationships.
Broaden Distribution Footprint. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the presence and penetration of each of our brands outside of the U.S. market. The European alpine market is currently significantly larger than the U.S. market and is highly fragmented by country, with no clear leader across Europe. We have been able to gain market share by emphasizing our Black Diamond brand, positioning it as a global brand with American roots and PIEPS as a global brand with European roots. We believe there is also a significant opportunity to expand our Sierra brand more extensively outside the U.S. market through additional sales and marketing investments.
New Product Development and Innovation. To drive organic growth within our existing businesses, we intend to leverage our strong brand names, customer relationships, proven capacity to develop new innovative products and product extensions in each of our existing product categories, and to expand into new product categories. Our new technologies are generally inspired by our continuing commitment to maximize the enjoyment and efficacy of the products for the outdoor sports for which we design.
Acquisition of Complementary Businesses. We expect to target acquisitions as a viable opportunity to gain access to new product groups, customer channels, and increase penetration of existing markets. We may also pursue acquisitions that diversify the Company within the outdoor and consumer markets. To the extent we pursue future acquisitions, we intend to focus on “super-fan” businesses with leading brands, recurring revenue, sustainable margins and strong cash flow. We anticipate financing future acquisitions prudently through a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flow, bank financings and new capital markets offerings.

Our Sierra brand was founded in 1947 and we believe represents the most precise and accurate bullets available for the shooting enthusiast. Our SKINourishment brand was founded in 2012, providing purpose-driven synthetic-free skincare products. Our brands also appeal to everyday customers seeking high quality products for outdoor or urban and suburban living. Our focus on innovation, safety and style differentiates us from our competitors.

Its products are sold under four brands—climbOn®, crossFIXE®, POLYN® and POLYN® Baby.
 
Strong Base of Business. Our outdoor products business benefits from a strong reputation for paradigm changing, high quality, innovative products that make us a leader in the outdoor industry with particular strength in product categories such as climbing, skiing, mountaineering and shooting. Underlying our innovative product lines is a strong stable of intellectual property, with multiple patents and patent applications, as well as valuable brands and trademarks. In addition, our user intimacy, strong retailer partnerships, operations and execution acumen and leadership as a champion in the access, education, and stewardship issues that affect our customers contribute to the robustness of our business.
Product Innovation and Development Capabilities. We have a long history of technical innovation and product development, with over 100 patents and patents pending worldwide. Our employees’ passion and intimacy with our core outdoor activities fosters new and innovative ideas and products, which we believe provides a significant advantage that will drive our Company to new levels. We seek to design products that enhance our customers’ personal performance as they participate in the activities we serve. We integrate quality assurance and quality control teams throughout the entire design process to maintain the quality and integrity that our brands are known for. We believe that our vertically integrated design, development process and enthusiastic employee base provide us with a unique competitive advantage to continue to drive future innovation for our Company and the markets we serve.
Diversified Portfolio by Product, Geography and Channel. Our business is highly diversified across products, geographies, and channels. We operate a multi-brand business with Black Diamond, Sierra, PIEPS, and SKINourishment branded products spanning 30 single product categories addressing four primary categories of climbing, skiing, mountain, and sport. Our bullet product line is the only single product category that accounts for more than 15% of annual sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. This provides seasonal diversification with a balance of sales across both the fall/winter and spring/summer sports seasons. Our brands are truly global with approximately 47% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 generated outside the United States in over 50 countries. We believe that our product, geographic, and distribution channel diversity allows us to maximize the reach of our brand portfolio while reducing the risk associated with any single product category or point of distribution.
Experienced and Incentivized Senior Management Team. The members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, including Mr. Warren Kanders, are substantial stockholders of the Company, and beneficially own approximately 27% of our outstanding common stock as of February 27, 2019, which we believe aligns the interests of our Board of Directors and our executive officers with that of our stockholders.
Growth-oriented Capital Structure. Our capital structure provides us with the capacity to fund future growth and our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to offset our net taxable income, which is expected to allow us to retain cash flow for future growth.
Operating Segments
 
As a result of our August 21, 2017 acquisition of Sierra, we now operate our business structure within two segments. These segments are defined based on the internal financial reporting used by management. Certain significant selling and general and administrative expenses are not allocated to the segments. Each segment is described below:

Product Design and Development
 
We conduct our product research and design activities at our locations in Salt Lake City, Utah, Sedalia, Missouri, Lebring, Austria, and Wimberly, Texas, and conduct product evaluations at our offices located in Innsbruck, Austria.
 
We typically bring new products from concept to market in approximately 18 to 36 months depending upon the technology integration and complexity of the product. We work simultaneously on product lines for the four subsequent selling seasons.
 
We expense research and development costs as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2018, we had 71 employees dedicated to research and development.
 
Customers
 
We market and distribute our products in over 50 countries, primarily through independent specialty stores and specialty chains, premium sporting goods and outdoor recreation stores, distributors and OEMs in the United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, and South America. Outside of North America and Europe, we sell our products through independent global distributors into specialty retail stores. We also sell our products directly to customers through our various websites.
 
Our end users include a broad range of consumers, including mountain, rock, ice, and gym climbers, winter-outdoor enthusiasts, trail runners, backpackers, competitive shooters, hunters, and outdoor-inspired consumers. Such consumers demand high-quality, reliable, and high-precision products to enhance their performance and, in some cases, safety in a multitude of outdoor activities. We expect to leverage our user intimacy, engineering prowess, and design ability to expand into related technical product categories that target the same demographic group and distribution channels.
 
During 2018, REI accounted for approximately 12% of our sales. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales force is generally deployed by geographic region: Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the United States. Our focus is on providing our products to a broad spectrum of outdoor enthusiasts. Within each of our brands, we strive to create a unique look for our products and to communicate those differences to the consumer. In addition, we are continuously exploring uses for brand and market research. We also regularly utilize various promotions and public relations campaigns.
 
We have consistently established relationships with professional athletes and influencers to help evaluate, promote and establish product performance and authenticity with customers. Such brand endorsers are one of many elements in our array of marketing materials, including instore displays, brochures and on our websites.

Manufacturing, Sourcing, Quality Assurance and Distribution
 
Manufacturing
 
Our objective is to deliver high quality products on-time, in the most cost-efficient manner, and to support innovation to market. To achieve this, everyone in the organization is involved to continuously improve how we operate.
 
The Black Diamond Equipment and PIEPS manufacturing and distribution operations are ISO 9001–2015 certified and are audited annually by an independent certifying agency to ensure Black Diamond Equipment’s and PIEPS’ quality management systems meet the requirements of ISO 9001–2015, and to ensure that Black Diamond Equipment’s and PIEPS’ certified products meet all necessary performance certification requirements. Sierra employs a best-in-class proprietary manufacturing process with respect to each one of its products. This process is performed in house and includes control of bullet jacket wall concentricity utilizing strict quality control standards overseen by experienced employees, yielding what we believe to be the tightest tolerances in the industry.
 
We manufacture approximately 25% to 30% of our products, including nearly all climbing hard goods and bullets, in our facilities in the United States. The remaining approximately 70% to 75% of our products are also manufactured to our specifications in third-party, independently-owned facilities. We keep employees and agents on-site or via regular visits at these third-party, independently owned facilities to ensure that our products are manufactured to meet our specifications. While we do not maintain a long-term manufacturing contract with those facilities, we believe that our long-term relationships with them will help to ensure that a sufficient supply of goods built to our specification are available in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms in the future.
 
Sourcing
 
We source raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers. Our primary raw materials include copper, lead, aluminum, steel, nylon, corrugated cardboard for packaging, metal, plastic and electrical components, and various textiles, foams, and fabrics. The raw materials and components used to manufacture our products are generally available from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to meet normal requirements.
 
We source packaging materials both domestically as well as from sources in Asia and Europe. We believe that all of our purchased products and materials could be readily obtained from alternative sources at comparable costs.
 
Quality Assurance
 
Quality assurance at the Company has two primary functions:
 

· | The first is to ensure that the products that we design and develop are manufactured to meet or exceed the Company’s own standards and international regulatory standards. This involves creating inspection documentation, reviewing manufacturing processes with our various vendor-partners, and inspecting finished product to assure it meets the rigorous standards required by our customers. These activities take place globally, wherever our products are manufactured.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The second function is to provide real and meaningful input to the new product development process. Quality assurance professionals interact closely with the design and engineering teams and bring knowledge and expertise to the design process, ensuring that the products we bring to market truly meet the criteria established when a new product is envisioned.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The engineering prowess of the quality assurance group is a core competency that the Company seeks to leverage across all product lines and brands.
 
Global Distribution
 
Our distribution model allows us to ship a broad cross-section of our product line in smaller quantities to our own global distribution centers and to those of our Independent Global Distributors (IGD) more frequently and at lower transportation and logistics costs.
Competition
 
Because of the diversity of our product offerings, we compete by niche with a variety of companies. Our products must stand up to the high standards set by the end users in each category where quality, durability and performance are paramount. We believe our products compete favorably on the basis of product innovation, product performance, marketing support, and price.
 
The popularity of various outdoor activities and changing design trends affect the desirability of our products. Therefore, we seek to anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings by developing new products with innovative performance features and designs, and by marketing our products in a persuasive and memorable fashion to drive consumer awareness and demand. Failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

-

 

We compete with niche, privately-owned companies as well as a number of brands owned by large multinational companies, such as those set forth below.
 

· | Climb: Our climbing products and accessories, such as apparel, footwear, protection, carabiners, helmets, and harnesses, compete with products from companies such as La Sportiva, Prana, Patagonia, Petzl, CAMP, EDELRID, and Mammut.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mountain: Our mountaineering products and accessories, such as backpacks, trekking poles, headlamps, and tents, compete with products from companies such as Petzl, Deuter, Leki, Komperdell, Marmot, Mountain Hardwear, Osprey, Sierra Designs, and The North Face.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ski: Our skiing products and accessories, such as technical apparel, skis, poles, avalanche airbags and transceivers, compete with products from competitors such as Arc’Teryx, Backcountry Access, Dynafit (Salewa), Atomic, Mammut, Marker, Ortovox, Salomon, Scarpa, Scott, and Volkl.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sport: We sell both bullets and ammunition to both retailers and distributors for sale to consumers but also supply bullets to OEMs who also sometimes manufacture bullets as well. Such companies include Vista, Nammo, Hornady, Fiocchi, Olin, and Remington.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, in certain categories we compete with certain of our large wholesale customers who focus on the outdoor market, such as REI, Mountain Equipment Co-op and Decathlon, which manufacture, market and distribute their own climbing, mountaineering, and skiing products under their own private labels.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe our registered and pending word and icon trademarks worldwide, including the Black Diamond and Diamond “C” logos, Black Diamond®, ATC ®, Camalot®, AvaLung ®, FlickLock®, Ascension™, Time is Life®, Hexentric®, Stopper®, Dawn Patrol®, Bibler®, “Use.Design.Build.Engineer.Repeat”™, Sierra®, Sierra® MatchKing®, Sierra® GameKing®, Sierra® BlitzKing® and PIEPS®, create international brand recognition for our products.
 
Solely for convenience, our trademarks and tradenames referred to in this report may appear without the ® and ™ symbols, but those references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights, or the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and tradenames.
 
We believe our brands have an established reputation for high quality, design, performance, reliability, and value, and accordingly, we actively monitor and police our brands against infringement to ensure their viability and enforceability.
 
In addition to trademarks, we hold over 100 patents and patents pending worldwide for a wide variety of technologies across our product lines.
 
Our success with our proprietary products is generally derived from our “first mover” advantage in the market as well as our commitment to protecting our current and future proprietary technologies and products, which acts as a deterrent to infringement of our intellectual property rights. While we believe our patent and trademark protection policies are robust and effective, if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours. Our principal intellectual property rights include our patents and trademarks but also include products containing proprietary trade secrets and manufacturing know-how.
 
We cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products. While we actively monitor our competitors to ensure that we do not compromise the intellectual property of others, we cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge, invalidate or void the application of any existing or future patents that we receive or license. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products that are in similar product niches as ours.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company’s products are outdoor activity-based, which results in seasonal variations in sales and profitability. On a calendar year basis, we generally experience our greatest sales in the first and second quarters for certain of our products including rock climbing gear, packs and tents, and in the third and fourth quarters for our ski, glove and ice climbing products. Sales of these products may be negatively affected by unfavorable weather conditions and other market trends. The fall/winter season represents approximately 53% of our sales while spring/summer represents approximately 47% of our sales. Sales of other products such as headlamps, lanterns, trekking poles and bullets are generally balanced throughout the year.

-

 

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital increases during the second and fourth quarters of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then decreases during the first and third quarters of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those that impose workplace standards and regulate the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage, and disposal of materials and substances including solid and hazardous wastes. We believe that we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not, and we believe in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had over 500 employees worldwide. We have not experienced any work stoppages or employee-related slowdowns and believe that our relationship with employees is satisfactory.
