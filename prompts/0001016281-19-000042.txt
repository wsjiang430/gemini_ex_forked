ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

GENERAL
Carriage Services, Inc. (“Carriage,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 1993 and is a leading provider of funeral and cemetery services and merchandise in the United States. We operate in two business segments: funeral home operations, which currently accounts for approximately 80% of our total revenue, and cemetery operations, which currently accounts for approximately 20% of our total revenue. 
At December 31, 2018, we operated 182 funeral homes in 29 states and 29 cemeteries in 11 states. We compete with other publicly held funeral and cemetery companies and smaller, independent operators. We believe we are a market leader in most of our markets. 
Our funeral homes offer a complete range of high value personal services to meet a family’s funeral needs, including consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, the sale of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and remembrance services and transportation services. Our cemeteries provide interment rights (grave sites and mausoleum spaces) and related merchandise, such as markers and outer burial containers. We provide funeral and cemetery services and products on both an “atneed” (time of death) and “preneed” (planned prior to death) basis.
CURRENT YEAR DEVELOPMENTS
Acquisitions. During 2018, we acquired four funeral home businesses. On July 10, 2018, we acquired two funeral home businesses, one in Fredericksburg, Virginia and one in Stafford, Virginia. On August 21, 2018, we acquired a funeral home business in Cookeville, Tennessee and on August 28, 2018, we acquired a funeral home business in Knightdale, North Carolina. The pro forma impact of the acquisitions on prior periods is not presented as the impact is not material to our reported results. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition.
Executive Leadership Changes. On October 29, 2018, Mark R. Bruce informed us that he would resign from his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer effective November 1, 2018.
Share Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 1,101,969 shares of common stock for a total cost of approximately $17.7 million at an average cost of $16.03 per share pursuant to our share repurchase program. Based on all repurchases to the date of this Current Report on Form 10-K, we have approximately $8.3 million available for repurchase under our approved program. 
Performance-Based Stock Awards. On November 29, 2018, we cancelled all the Performance Award Agreements previously awarded to all individuals in 2016, 2017 and 2018, which resulted in a write-off of $3.3 million. Prior to such cancellation, each of the cancelled Performance Award Agreements provided for contingent compensation, which was payable to the recipients of the awards in shares of common stock, based on our performance over a five-year period from the date of grant. 
Dividends. During 2018, we paid $5.5 million in dividends. 
Balance Sheet Recapitalization. On April 25, 2018, we entered into an eighth amendment to our former secured credit facility, which increased the aggregate revolving credit commitment available thereunder to $200.0 million. 
On May 7, 2018, we completed privately-negotiated exchanges of approximately $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2021 (the “Convertible Notes”) for $75.2 million in cash and 2,822,859 newly issued shares of our common stock.
On May 31, 2018, we completed the issuance of $325.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Senior Notes”). We used $291.4 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes to repay all amounts outstanding under our former secured credit facility and all commitments thereunder were terminated. 
On May 31, 2018, in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, we entered into a new $150.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “New Credit Facility”). 
On December 24, 2018, we completed privately-negotiated repurchases of an additional $22.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes for $23.0 million in cash, leaving a principal balance of $6.3 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018.

CARRIAGE GOOD TO GREAT JOURNEY
Over the latter part of 2018, We embarked on a rapid and transformative High Performance and Value Creation Trends Restoration Program. We performed a comprehensive analysis of each of our businesses since 2011 using both operating and financial data trends as well as the corresponding Standards Achievement trends. Our goal was to first identify the root causes of the declining performance trends over the last two years in too many of our portfolio businesses and then to quickly make the necessary changes to restore positive performance trends beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and continuing thereafter for a five year timeframe ending in 2023. We believe we have rallied and energized all of our field and support leaders around the idea of getting back on the Carriage Good To Great Journey with high and sustainable broad and deep portfolio performance.
The changing preferences of client families in our industry and the revenue challenges from higher rates of cremations versus traditional burials are not issues that have easy solutions. Yet many of our best Managing Partners and businesses have continued with High Standards Achievement in the face of these challenges. As a central element of this High Performance and Value Creation Trends Restoration Program, we have done the following:

• | solicited feedback on the reasons for our portfolio performance decline, first from our Standards Council and subsequently from all of our Regional Partners and Directors of Support;


• | Mel Payne, our Chief Executive Officer, has directed more of his time and attention to operations and is actively engaging, coaching and mentoring all of our remaining operating leadership on the proper definition of their roles in support of the long-term success of each Managing Partner and business;


• | updated and rebooted our Funeral and Cemetery Standards as well as the groupings that we utilize to review our businesses to ensure alignment with changing preferences of client families and our High Performance and Value Creation Trends Restoration Program;


• | redefined Standards Achievement success and updated criteria for the Being The Best and Good To Great incentive programs; and


• | continued to explore ways in which we can develop support services and resource tools, either internally or through third parties, that can be made available to our Managing Partners and Sales Managers. We expect that this support focus, on areas such as social media, will better prepare our field leaders to deal with the changing competitive dynamics in each market.

FUNERAL AND CEMETERY INDUSTRY
Funeral home and cemetery businesses provide products and services to families in three principal areas: (i) ceremony and tribute, generally in the form of a funeral or memorial service; (ii) disposition of remains, either through burial or cremation; and (iii) memorialization, generally through monuments, markers or inscriptions. 
The funeral and cemetery industry in the United States is characterized by the following fundamental attributes (the industry statistics and information included in this Form 10-K are from reports compiled by Sundale Research based on information as of September 30, 2018 from the U.S. Department of Commerce). 
Deaths and Death Trends
During 2018, the number of deaths in the United States increased by approximately 1.4% following a 2.1% and a 1.2% increase in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The rapidly growing and aging population is expected to result in an increase in the number of deaths in the future. The number of Americans age 55 to 64 totaled 42.0 million in 2017 and is expected to grow 1.9% to 46.2 million by 2022, making this the second fastest-growing age group, while the fastest-growing segment of the population is Americans aged 65 and older, with 49.6 million in 2017. This age group is expected to increase to 57.3 million in 2022, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 2.9%. Overall, from 2017 to 2022, the number of deaths in the United States is expected to increase by an average of 1.8% per year, reaching an estimated 3.1 million in 2022. 
Burial and Cremation Trends 
While the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few years, the burial rate is expected to continue to decline. In 2018, the number of burials in the United States decreased by an estimated 2.5%, following declines of 0.9% and 1.8% in 2017 and 2016 respectively. The number of burials in the United States is estimated to fall by an average of 1.0% per year from 2017 through 2022. In 2022, it is estimated that there will be approximately 1.29 million burials in the United States and a burial rate of 42.0%.

In 2018, the number of cremations in the United States increased by an estimated 5.0%, following increases of 5.1% and 4.3% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Slower growth is expected through 2022, due in part to the sheer size of the market for cremations; however, shifting preferences will continue to lead to a considerable rise in cremations. The number of cremations in the United States is expected to grow by an average of 4.2% per year from 2017 through 2022. In 2022, it is estimated that there will be approximately 1.78 million cremations in the United States and a cremation rate of 58.0%. 
Highly Fragmented Ownership
Our industry remains highly fragmented, and succession planning issues for privately-owned funeral and cemetery businesses have become more difficult and complex than ever. We believe Carriage provides a unique consolidation and operating framework that offers a highly attractive succession planning solution for owners who want their legacy family business to remain operationally prosperous in their local communities. We also believe that our decentralized operating model will continue to attract the top entrepreneurial talent in our industry. Our focus is on partnering with the best of the remaining independent funeral home and cemetery owners in major strategic markets around the country where the potential for future revenue growth is the highest.
The largest publicly held operators, in terms of revenue, of both funeral homes and cemeteries in the United States are Service Corporation International (“SCI”), StoneMor Partners L.P. (“StoneMor”) and Carriage. We believe these three companies collectively represent approximately 20% of funeral and cemetery revenue in the United States. Independent businesses, along with a few privately-owned consolidators, represent the remaining amount of industry revenue, accounting for an estimated 80% share of revenue.
Heritage and Tradition
Funeral home and cemetery businesses have traditionally been family-owned businesses that have built a local heritage and tradition through successive generations, providing a foundation for ongoing business opportunities from established client family relationships and related referrals. Given the sensitive nature of our business, we believe that relationships fostered at the local level build trust in the community and are a key driver of market share. While new entrants may enter any given market, the time and resources required to develop local heritage and tradition serve as important barriers to entry. 
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our business strategy is based on strong, local leadership with entrepreneurial principles that is focused on sustainable long term market share, revenue, and profitability growth in each local business. We believe Carriage has the most innovative operating model in the funeral and cemetery industry, which we are able to achieve through a decentralized, high-performance culture operating framework linked with incentive compensation programs that attract top-quality industry talent to our organization.
Our Mission Statement states that “we are committed to being the most professional, ethical and highest quality funeral and cemetery service organization in our industry” and our Guiding Principles state our core values, which are comprised of:    

• | Honesty, integrity and quality in all that we do;


• | Hard work, pride of accomplishment and shared success through employee ownership;


• | Belief in the power of people through individual initiative and teamwork;


• | Outstanding service and profitability go hand-in-hand; and


• | Growth of the Company is driven by decentralization and partnership.

Our five Guiding Principles collectively embody our Being The Best high-performance cultural, operating framework. Our operations and business strategy are built upon the execution of the following three models:

• | Standards Operating Model;


• | 4E Leadership Model; and


• | Strategic Acquisition Model.

Standards Operating Model
Our Standards Operating Model is focused on growing local market share, people development, and the key operating and financial metrics that drive long-term, sustainable revenue growth and improved earning power of our portfolio of businesses by employing leadership and entrepreneurial principles that fit the nature of our high-value personal service business. Standards Achievement is the measure by which we judge the success of each business and incentivize our local managers and their teams. Our Standards Operating Model is not designed to produce maximum short-term earnings because we believe such performance is unsustainable and will ultimately stress the business, which very often leads to declining market share, revenue and earnings. 
4

Important elements of our Standards Operating Model include:

• | Balanced Operating Model – We believe a decentralized structure works best in the funeral and cemetery industry. Successful execution of our Standards Operating Model is highly dependent on strong local leadership, intelligent risk taking, entrepreneurial drive and corporate support aligned with the key drivers of a successful operation organized around three primary areas - market share, people and operating financial metrics.


• | Incentives Aligned with Standards – Empowering local managers, who we call Managing Partners, to do the right things in their operations and local communities, and providing appropriate support with operating and financial practices, will enable long-term growth and sustainable profitability. Each Managing Partner participates in a variable bonus plan whereby he or she earns a percentage of his or her respective business’ earnings based upon the actual standards achieved as long as the performance exceeds our minimum standards. Our five year incentive award, called the “Good to Great Award,” rewards Managing Partners with a bonus at the end of five years, equal to a ratio of four to six times their average annual bonus, if they are able to achieve an annual compound growth rate of 2% over a five year period. After each five year incentive plan is achieved and paid out, a new five year plan period begins. To date, we have had three performance periods in which we have paid $3.8 million to the Managing Partners who have earned a bonus under this program.


• | The Right Local Leadership – Successful execution of our operating model is highly dependent on strong local leadership as defined by our 4E Leadership Model, intelligent risk taking and entrepreneurial empowerment. A Managing Partner’s performance is judged according to achievement of the standards for that business.

4E Leadership Model
Our 4E Leadership Model requires strong local leadership in each business to grow an entrepreneurial, decentralized, high-value, personal service and sales business at sustainable profit margins. Our 4E Leadership Model is based upon principles established by Jack Welch during his tenure at General Electric, and is based upon 4E qualities essential to succeed in a high-performance culture: Energy to get the job done; the ability to Energize others; the Edge necessary to make difficult decisions; and the ability to Execute and produce results. To achieve a high level within our Standards in a business year after year, we require local Managing Partners that have the 4E Leadership skills to entrepreneurially grow the business by hiring, training and developing highly motivated and productive local teams. 
Strategic Acquisition Model
Our Standards Operating Model led to the development of our Strategic Acquisition Model, which guides our acquisition strategy. We believe that both models, when executed effectively, will drive long-term, sustainable increases in market share, revenue, earnings and cash flow. We believe a primary driver of higher revenue and profits in the future will be the execution of our Strategic Acquisition Model using strategic ranking criteria to assess acquisition candidates. As we execute this strategy over time, we expect to acquire larger, higher margin strategic businesses. 
We have learned that the long-term growth or decline of a local branded funeral and cemetery business is reflected by several criteria that correlate strongly with five to ten year performance in volumes (market share), revenue and sustainable field-level earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) margins (a non-GAAP measure). We use the following criteria, to name a few, to rank the strategic position of each potential acquisition:

• | cultural alignment;


• | volume and price trends;


• | size of business;


• | size of market;


• | competitive standing;


• | demographics;


• | strength of brand; and


• | barriers to entry.

The valuation of the acquisition candidate is then determined through the application of an appropriate after-tax cash return on investment that exceeds our cost of capital.
Our belief in our Mission Statement and Guiding Principles that define us and proper execution of the three models that define our strategy have given us the competitive advantage in any market in which we compete. We believe that we can execute our three models without proportionate incremental investment in our consolidation platform infrastructure and without additional 
5

fixed regional and corporate overhead. This gives us a competitive advantage that is evidenced by the sustained earning power of our portfolio as defined by our EBITDA margin. 
Other elements of our overall business strategy include the following:
Enhancement of Funeral and Cremation Services. Personalization and pre-planning continue to be two of the most important trends in the funeral and cremation services and merchandise industry, but the move toward more cremations may be the most significant. While this trend is expected to continue, other factors are expected to lead to rising industry revenue, including an increase in spending on additional or unique funeral and cremation services. 
The percentage of funeral services performed by our funeral homes for which cremation was chosen was 50.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, 51.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Shifting preferences will likely continue to lead to a considerable rise in cremations; as such, we are focused on educating and providing our cremation customers additional services and products that are available. All of our funeral homes offer cremation products and services. While the average revenue for a cremation service is generally lower than that of an average traditional, full-service funeral, we have found that this revenue can be substantially enhanced by our emphasis on offering additional services and merchandise, including counseling referrals, video tributes, flowers, burial garments and memorial items such as urns, keepsake jewelry and other items that hold a portion of the cremated remains. 
Preneed Funeral Sales Program. We operate under a local, decentralized preneed sales strategy whereby each business location customizes its preneed program to its local needs. Approximately 20% of our funeral services performed are funded through preneed contracts, which are usually secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer or by the purchase of a life insurance policy, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. Insurance-funded contracts allow us to earn commission income to improve our near-term cash flow and offset a significant amount of the up-front costs associated with preneed sales. Trust funded contracts typically provide cash that is invested in various securities with the expectation that returns will exceed the growth factor in the insurance contracts. The cash flow and earnings from insurance contracts are more stable, but are generally lower than traditional trust fund investments. In markets that depend on preneed sales for market share, we supplement the arrangements written by funeral directors with sales sourced by sales counselors and third party sellers.
Preneed Cemetery Sales Program. Our preneed cemetery strategy is to build family heritage in our cemeteries by selling property and internment rights prior to death through full time, highly motivated and entrepreneurial local sales teams. Approximately 40% of our cemetery operating revenue is derived from preneed property sales. Our goal is to build broader and deeper teams of sales leaders and counselors in our larger and more strategically located cemeteries in order to focus on growth of our preneed property sales. Cemetery merchandise and services are often purchased in addition to cemetery property at the time of sale. The performance of these preneed cemetery contracts is secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. General consumer confidence and discretionary income have a significant impact on our preneed sales success rate. 
OUR STRENGTHS
Market Leader. We compete with other public funeral and cemetery companies and smaller, independent operators and believe we are a market leader in most of our markets. We focus on markets that perform better than the industry average and are generally insulated from material economic and demographic changes. 
High Performance, Decentralized, Partnership Culture. Our funeral homes and cemeteries are managed by Managing Partners with extensive funeral and cemetery industry experience, often within their local markets. Our Managing Partners have responsibility for day-to-day operations, but are required to follow operating and financial standards based on our Standards Operating Model that are custom designed for distinct business groupings which is based on the size (number of funerals) and average revenue per funeral. This strategy allows each local business to maintain its unique identity within its local market and to capitalize on its reputation and heritage while our senior leadership provides support services from our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas. We believe our culture is very attractive to owners of premier independent businesses that fit our profile of suitable acquisition candidates.
Flexible Capital Structure. We have no short-term debt maturity issues. We believe that our capital structure provides us with financial flexibility by allowing us to invest our cash flow in growth opportunities, such as business acquisitions and cemetery inventory projects. For additional information regarding our capital structure, please see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Stable Cash Flow. We have demonstrated the ability to generate strong and stable cash flow. Cash flow from operations for 2018 totaled $49.0 million, which was used primarily for the acquisition of four funeral home businesses, capital expenditures and our working capital needs, including payment of dividends and our debt obligations. We intend to use our cash flow to acquire 
6

funeral home and cemetery businesses and to fund internal growth projects, such as cemetery inventory development and funeral home expansion projects, and for payment of dividends and our debt obligations. Our growth strategy is the primary way we expect to increase stockholder value. We may also use available cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock and remaining convertible notes from time to time. While we reassess our capital allocation strategy annually, we currently believe that our financial goals will best be achieved by continuing to improve the operating and financial performance of our existing portfolio of businesses while selectively investing our net cash flow in growth opportunities that generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
Strong Field-Level Gross Profit Margins. We believe that we have strong field-level gross profit margins and that this performance is a testament to the success of our business strategies. Our strong margins and the ability to control costs are important advantages in a business such as ours that is characterized by a high fixed-cost structure. We will continue to seek ways to improve our financial performance, and we believe that our Standards Operating Model will continue to yield long-term improvement in our financial results.
Integrated Information Systems. We have implemented information systems to support local business decisions and to monitor performance of our businesses compared to financial and performance standards. All of our funeral homes and cemeteries are connected to our Houston support home office, which allows us to monitor and assess critical operating and financial data and analyze the performance of individual locations on a timely basis. Furthermore, our information system infrastructure provides senior management with a critical tool for monitoring and adhering to our established internal controls, which is critical given our decentralized model and the sensitive nature of our business operations.
Proven Leadership Team. Our leadership team, headed by our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Melvin C. Payne, is characterized by a dynamic culture that focuses on addressing changing market conditions and emerging trends in the funeral services industry. We believe our culture of emphasizing the 4Es (Energy, Energize Others, Edge and Execution) leadership characteristics is critical and will provide an important advantage as the funeral and cemetery industry evolves. We are committed to continue operating an efficient organization and strengthening our corporate and local business leadership. Our businesses are supported by a broader team of High Performance leaders across multiple disciplines located in our Houston home office. This promotes more cooperation and synergy between our funeral and cemetery operations and supports the goal of market-share and volume growth in our most significant markets.
OUR OPERATIONS
We conduct our funeral and cemetery operations only in the United States. Our operations are reported in two segments: funeral home operations and cemetery operations. Information for each of our segments is presented below and in our financial statements set forth herein.
Funeral Home Operations
At December 31, 2018, we operated 182 funeral homes in 29 states. Funeral home revenue currently accounts for approximately 80% of our total revenue. The funeral home operations are managed by a team of experienced industry professionals and regional leadership with substantial management experience in our industry. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 22 for segment data related to our funeral home operations.
Our funeral homes offer a complete range of services to meet a family’s funeral needs, including consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, the sale of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and remembrance services and transportation services. Most of our funeral homes have a non-denominational chapel on the premises, which permits family visitation and services to take place at one location and thereby reduces transportation costs and inconvenience to the family.
Funeral homes are principally service businesses that provide burial and cremation services and sell related merchandise, such as caskets and urns. The sources and availability of caskets and urns are from a small number of national providers that have distribution centers near our businesses. We typically order and receive the merchandise within 24 hours. 
Given the high fixed-cost structure associated with funeral home operations, we believe the following are key factors affecting our profitability:

• | our ability to establish and maintain market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships;


• | our ability to effectively respond to the increasing trends towards cremation packaging complimentary services and merchandise;


• | our ability to control salary, merchandise and other controllable costs;


• | our ability to exercise pricing leverage related to our atneed business to increase average revenue per contract;

7


• | demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age, which impact death rates and number of deaths; and


• | our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds and our securities portfolio within the trust funds, which would offset lower pricing power as preneed contracts mature.

Cemetery Operations
At December 31, 2018, we operated 29 cemeteries in 11 states. Cemetery revenue currently accounts for approximately 20% of our total revenue. The cemetery operations are managed by a team of experienced industry and sales professionals and regional leadership with substantial management experience in our industry. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 22 for segment data related to our cemetery operations.
Our cemetery products and services include interment services, the rights to interment in cemetery sites (primarily grave sites, mausoleum crypts and niches) and related cemetery merchandise, such as memorials and vaults. Cemetery operations generate revenue through sales of interment rights and memorials, installation fees, fees for interment and cremation memorialization products, finance charges from installment sales contracts and investment income from preneed cemetery merchandise trusts and perpetual care trusts. Cemetery revenue generated from atneed services and merchandise sales generally is subject to many of the same key profitability factors as our funeral home business. Our cemetery operating results are affected by the following key factors:

• | size and success of our sales organization;


• | local perceptions and heritage of our cemeteries;


• | our ability to adapt to changes in the economy and consumer confidence; and


• | our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds, finance charges on installment contracts and our securities portfolio within the trust funds.

Preneed Programs
Funeral and cemetery arrangements sold prior to death occurring are referred to as preneed contracts.We market funeral and cemetery services and products on a preneed basis at the local level. Preneed funeral or cemetery contracts enable families to establish, in advance, the type of service to be performed, the products to be used and the cost of such products and services. Preneed contracts permit families to eliminate issues of making deathcare plans at the time of need and allow input from other family members before the death occurs. We guarantee the price and performance of the preneed contracts to the customer.
In addition to preneed funeral contracts, we also offer “pre-planned” funeral arrangements whereby a customer determines in advance substantially all of the details of a funeral service without any financial commitment or other obligation on the part of the client until the actual time of need. Pre-planned funeral arrangements permit a family to avoid issues of making deathcare plans at the time of need and enable a funeral home to establish relationships with a client that may eventually lead to an atneed sale.
We sold 7,444 and 8,303 preneed funeral contracts, net of cancellations, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we had a backlog of 96,310 preneed funeral contracts and 58,320 preneed cemetery contracts to be delivered in the future. Approximately 20% of our funeral contract volumes during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 originated through preneed contracts. Cemetery revenue that originated from preneed contracts represented approximately 65% of our total cemetery revenue for 2017 and 2018. 
At December 31, 2018, we employed a staff of 173 advance-planning and family service representatives for the sale of preneed products and services. Our advance-planning and family service representatives primarily assist families in making atneed and preneed funeral, memorialization and cemetery arrangements through the selection and purchase of cemetery property, merchandise and services and ensuring that the expectations of our client families and their guests are exceeded.

Trust Funds and Insurance Contracts
We have established a variety of trusts in connection with funeral home and cemetery operations as required under applicable state laws. Such trusts include (i) preneed funeral trusts; (ii) preneed cemetery merchandise and service trusts; and (iii) cemetery perpetual care trusts. These trusts are typically administered by independent financial institutions selected by us. Investment management and advisory services are provided either by our wholly-owned registered investment advisory firm, CSV RIA, or by independent financial advisors. As of December 31, 2018, CSV RIA provided these services to one institution, which has custody of approximately 75% of our trust assets, for a fee based on the market value of trust assets. Under state trust laws, we are allowed to charge the trust a fee for advising on the investment of the trust assets and these fees are recognized as income in the period in which services are provided. The investment advisors establish an investment policy that gives guidance on asset allocation, investment requirements, investment manager selection and performance monitoring. The investment objectives are tailored to generate long-term investment returns without assuming undue risk, while ensuring the management of assets is in compliance with applicable laws.
Preneed funeral sales generally require deposits to a trust or purchase of a third-party insurance product. Trust fund income earned, along with the receipt and recognition of any insurance benefits, are deferred until the service is performed or the merchandise is delivered. Trust fund holdings and deferred revenue are reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, while the insurance contracts are not on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In most states, we are not permitted to withdraw principal or investment income from such trusts until the funeral service is performed. Some states, however, allow for the retention of a percentage (generally 10%) of the receipts to offset any administrative and selling expenses. The aggregate balance of our preneed funeral contracts held in trust, insurance contracts and receivables from preneed trusts was $487.3 million as of December 31, 2018.
We are generally required under applicable state laws to deposit a specified amount (which varies from state to state, generally 50% to 100% of the selling price) into a merchandise and service trust fund for preneed cemetery merchandise and services sales. The related trust fund income earned is recognized when the related merchandise and services are delivered. We are generally permitted to withdraw the trust principal and accrued income when the merchandise is actually delivered, when the service is provided or when the contract is canceled. However, certain states allow the withdrawal of income prior to delivery when the regulations identify excess earnings in the trusts. We did not withdraw any trust income in 2017 and 2018. Cemetery merchandise and service trust fund balances totaled $62.4 million as of December 31, 2018.
In most states, regulations require a portion (generally 10%) of the sale amount of cemetery property and memorials to be placed in a perpetual care trust. The income from these perpetual care trusts provides funds necessary to maintain cemetery property and memorials in perpetuity. This trust fund income is recognized, as earned and is reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as Other revenue. While we are entitled to withdraw the income from perpetual care trusts to provide for maintenance of cemetery property and memorials, we are restricted from withdrawing any of the principal balances of the trust fund. Perpetual care trust balances totaled $44.1 million at December 31, 2018.
For additional information with respect to our trusts, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 7, 9 and 11.
SEASONALITY
Our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate. Generally, the number of deaths is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year.
COMPETITION
The operating environment in the funeral and cemetery industry has been highly competitive. Publicly traded companies operating in the United States include SCI, StoneMor and Carriage. In addition, a number of smaller private consolidators have been active in acquiring and operating funeral homes and cemeteries.
Our funeral home and cemetery operations face competition in the markets that they serve. Our primary competition in most of our markets is from local independent operators. We have observed new start-up competition in certain areas of the country, which may impact our profitability in certain markets. Market share for funeral homes and cemeteries is largely a function of reputation and heritage, although competitive pricing, professional service and attractive, well-maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important. Because of the importance of reputation and heritage, market share increases are usually gained over a long period of time. The sale of preneed funeral services and cemetery property has increasingly been used by many companies as a marketing tool to build market share.
There has been increasing competition from providers specializing in specific services, such as cremations, who offer minimal service and low-end pricing. We also face competition from companies that market products and related merchandise over the

internet and non-traditional casket stores in certain markets. These competitors have been successful in capturing a portion of the low-end market and product sales.
REGULATION
General. Our operations are subject to regulations, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including extensive regulations concerning trust funds, preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services and various other aspects of our business. We believe that we comply in all material respects with the provisions of these laws, ordinances and regulations. Legislative bodies and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws and regulations, some of which could have a material impact on our business. We cannot predict the impact of any future laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations.
Federal Trade Commission. Our funeral home operations are comprehensively regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and a trade regulation rule for the funeral industry promulgated thereunder referred to as the “Funeral Rule.” The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized pricing information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: (i) misrepresenting legal, crematory and cemetery requirements; (ii) embalming for a fee without permission; (iii) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; (iv) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services; (v) misrepresenting state and local requirements for an outer burial container; and (vi) representing that funeral goods and services have preservative and protective value. Additionally, the Funeral Rule requires the disclosure of mark-ups, commissions, additional charges and rebates related to cash advance items.
Environmental. Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing air emissions, waste management and disposal and wastewater discharges. For instance, the federal Clean Air Act and analogous state laws, which restrict the emission of pollutants from many sources, including crematories, may require us to apply for and obtain air emissions permits, install costly emissions control equipment, and conduct monitoring and reporting tasks. Also, in the course of our operations, we store and use chemicals and other regulated substances as well as generate wastes that may subject us to strict liability under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state laws, which govern the treatment, storage, and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes, and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes cleanup obligations on current and past owners or operators of facilities where hazardous substance releases occurred and anyone who transported or disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of hazardous substances released into the environment from such sites. In addition, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws regulate discharges of pollutants to state and federal waters. Underground and aboveground storage tanks that store chemicals and fuels for vehicle maintenance or general operations are located at certain of our facilities and any spills or releases from those facilities may cause us to incur remedial liabilities under the Clean Water Act or analogous state laws as well as potential liabilities for damages to properties or persons. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, delays in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in affected areas. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damages to property, natural resources or persons. Also, it is possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental requirements could result in additional, currently unidentifiable costs or liabilities to us, such as requirements to purchase pollution control equipment or implement operational changes or improvements. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot assure that we will not incur substantial costs in the future.
Worker Health and Safety. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
