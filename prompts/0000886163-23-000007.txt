Item 1. | Business

Overview
Our business is focused on acquiring or funding programs and technologies that pharmaceutical companies use to discover and develop medicines. Our business model provides a diversified portfolio of biotech and pharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure. The biotechnology industry is characterized by a binary clinical risk, in that, either a drug candidate is successfully developed and receives regulatory marketing approval, or the drug candidate fails in clinical trials. Our goal is to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a profitable and diversified manner while mitigating the binary clinical risk associated with developing a single program. 
Our business model is focused on funding mid to late-stage drug development in return for economic rights and out-licensing our technology platforms to help partners discover and develop medicines. We partner with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage what they do best (late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization) ultimately to generate our revenue. Our Captisol platform technology is a chemically modified cyclodextrin with a structure designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs. Our Pelican Expression Technology is a robust, validated, cost-effective and scalable platform for recombinant protein production that is especially well-suited for complex, large-scale protein production where traditional systems are not. We have established multiple alliances, licenses and other business relationships with the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies including Amgen, Merck, Pfizer, Jazz, Takeda, Gilead Sciences and Baxter International.
Our revenue consists of three primary elements: royalties from commercialized products, sales of Captisol material, and contract revenue from license, milestone and other service payments. We selectively pursue acquisitions and drug development funding opportunities that address high unmet clinical needs to bring in new assets, pipelines, and technologies to aid in generating additional potential new revenue streams.
OmniAb Separation and Spin-Off
On March 23, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), by and among our company, Avista Public Acquisition Corp. II (New OmniAb) and OmniAb, Inc., a Delaware corporation and then wholly-owned subsidiary of our company (OmniAb), and Orwell Merger Sub Inc. (Merger Sub), pursuant to which New OmniAb combined with OmniAb, our then-antibody discovery business (the OmniAb Business), in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2022, among New OmniAb, our company and OmniAb (the Separation Agreement), we transferred the OmniAb Business, including certain of our related subsidiaries, to OmniAb and, in connection therewith, distributed (the Distribution) to Ligand stockholders 100% of the common stock of OmniAb. Immediately following the Distribution, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into OmniAb (the Merger), with OmniAb continuing as the surviving company in the Merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of New OmniAb.
Technologies
Through a combination of research and acquisitions, we have created a partnered portfolio with a wide variety of underlying technologies. This diversification provides the added benefits of exposure to a wider variety of science, more licensing opportunities and lower impact of individual patent expiry.
Captisol Technology
Captisol is a patent-protected, chemically modified cyclodextrin with a structure designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs. This unique technology has enabled several FDA-approved products, including Gilead’s Veklury, Amgen’s Kyprolis, Baxter International’s Nexterone, Acrotech Biopharma’s and CASI Pharmaceuticals’ Evomela, Melinta Therapeutics’ Baxdela and Sage Therapeutics’ Zulresso. There are many Captisol-enabled products currently in various stages of development. We maintain a broad global patent portfolio for Captisol with the latest expiration date in 2035. Other patent applications covering methods of making Captisol, if issued, extend to 2041.
In addition to solid Captisol powder, we offer our partners access to cGMP manufactured aqueous Captisol concentrate. This product offering was established in 2017 to reduce cycle time and increase Captisol production capacity for large volume drug products. We maintain both Type IV and Type V DMFs with the FDA. These DMFs contain manufacturing and safety information relating to Captisol that our licensees can reference when developing Captisol-enabled drugs. We also have active DMFs in Japan, China and Canada. In 2022, commercial products using Captisol made up over half of our total royalty revenue.
Pelican Expression Technology™ Platform
The Pelican Expression Technology platform is a robust, validated, cost-effective and scalable platform for recombinant protein production, and is especially well-suited for complex, large-scale protein production. Global manufacturers have demonstrated consistent success with the platform and the technology is currently out-licensed for multiple commercial and development-stage programs. The versatility of the platform has been demonstrated in the production of enzymes, peptides, antibody derivatives and engineered non-natural proteins. Partners seek the platform as it contributes significant value to biopharmaceutical development programs by reducing timelines and costs associated with research and development through commercial manufacturing of therapeutics and vaccines. Given pharmaceutical industry trends toward large molecules with increased structural complexities, the Pelican Expression Technology platform is well positioned to meet these growing needs as one of the most comprehensive and broadly available, commercially validated protein production platform in the industry.
We acquired the Pelican Expression Technology through our acquisition of Pfenex in October 2020. Several of our partners have commercial products and late stage clinical product candidates utilizing Pelican Expression Technology. In 2022, commercial products acquired from the Pfenex acquisition made up over one-third of our total royalty revenue.
HepDirect, LTP, and BEPro Technology Platform
The HepDirect and LTP platforms are our proprietary liver-targeting prodrug technologies that can deliver many different chemical classes of drugs to the liver by using a chemical modification that renders an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) biologically inactive until cleaved by a liver-specific enzyme. These technologies may improve the efficacy and/or safety of certain drugs and can be applied to marketed or new drug products to treat liver diseases or diseases caused by hemostasis imbalance of circulating molecules controlled by the liver. 
The BEPro technology platform is a next generation prodrug technology distinct from HepDirect and LTP prodrug technologies, expanding use to non-liver related diseases. BEPro is specifically applicable to nucleotides and nucleotide analogs for the development of compounds with improved product profiles. Ligand has demonstrated improvements in cell penetration and oral, intravenous and inhaled pharmacokinetics with BEPro-enabled nucleotide analogs.
SUREtechnology Platform (owned by Selexis)
We acquired economic rights to various SUREtechnology Platform programs from Selexis. The SUREtechnology Platform, developed and owned by Selexis, is a novel technology that improves the way that cells are utilized in the development and manufacturing of recombinant proteins and drugs.

Acquisitions
We are a company devoted to identifying cutting-edge science and have exhibited a track record of capital deployment to create a high growth business model that operates with an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Over the last 15 years we have deployed approximately $1 billion of capital to build our portfolio. Following the spin-off of our OmniAb antibody discovery business, our strategy is to continue to expand our pipeline by acquiring additional revenue streams on both early and late stage drug product candidates from third parties, as well as acquiring commercial stage drugs for sale. Expanding our pipeline through these acquisitions can allow for further diversification across therapeutic areas and development stages. The following is a timeline of acquisitions we've completed over the last 15 years:
Selected Commercial Programs
The following programs represent important revenue-generating components of our current portfolio. For information about the royalties owed to us for these programs, see “Royalties” later in this business section.
Kyprolis (Amgen, Ono, BeiGene)
We supply Captisol to Amgen for use with Kyprolis (carfilzomib), and granted Amgen an exclusive product-specific license under our patent rights with respect to Captisol. Kyprolis is formulated with Ligand’s Captisol technology and is approved in the United States for the following:
•In combination with dexamethasone, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, daratumumab plus dexamethasone, or daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and dexamethasone, or isatuximab and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy.
•As a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy.
Our agreement with Amgen may be terminated by either party in the event of material breach or bankruptcy, or unilaterally by Amgen with prior written notice, subject to certain surviving obligations. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. Under this agreement, we are entitled to receive revenue from clinical and commercial Captisol material sales and royalties on annual net sales of Kyprolis based on our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of Kyprolis which are not expected to expire until 2033.
Teriparatide Injection Product (PF708) (Alvogen/Adalvo)
We acquired the Teriparatide Injection product with the acquisition of Pfenex in October 2020. Teriparatide Injection is a drug indicated for uses including the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture. Teriparatide Injection was developed using our Pelican Expression Technology™ and was approved by the FDA in 2019 in accordance with the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, with FORTEO as the reference product. Our commercialization partner, Alvogen launched the product in June 2020 in the United States. 
Our partner Alvogen has exclusively licensed the rights to commercialize and manufacture the Teriparatide Injection product in the United States, while Adalvo has the rights to commercialize in the EU, certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the rest of world (ROW) territories (the latter defined as all countries outside of the EU, U.S. and MENA, excluding Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand). In August 2020, marketing authorizationb throughout the EU was received under the trade name Livogiva and in December 2020 in Saudi Arabia under the name Bonteo. In December of 2022, we terminated a license agreement with Beijing Kangchen Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Kangchen) thereby regaining the right to commercialize PF708 in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand along with a non-exclusive right to conduct development activities in such countries with respect to PF708. 
In accordance with our agreements with Alvogen, we are eligible to receive tiered gross profit sharing of between 25% and 40% of quarterly profits prior to an “A” therapeutic equivalence designation, which increases to a flat 50% if an “A” rating is achieved.
In accordance with our EU, MENA and ROW agreements with Adalvo, we may be eligible to receive additional upfront and milestone payments of $1.5 million and may also be eligible to receive up to 60% of gross profit derived from product sales and regional license fees, if approved, depending on geography, cost of goods sold and sublicense fees.
Evomela (Acrotech and CASI)
We supply Captisol to, and receive royalties from, Acrotech Biopharma for sales of Evomela in the U.S., and CASI Pharmaceuticals for sales in China. Evomela received market approval by the NMPA in August of 2019. It is the only approved and commercially available melphalan product in China. Evomela is a Captisol-enabled melphalan IV formulation which is approved by the FDA for use in two indications:
•a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in patients with multiple myeloma; and 
•for the palliative treatment of patients with multiple myeloma for whom oral therapy is not appropriate.
Evomela has been granted Orphan Designation by the FDA for use as a high-dose conditioning regimen for patients with multiple myeloma undergoing ASCT. The Evomela formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which has been reported to cause renal and cardiac side-effects that limit the ability to deliver higher quantities of therapeutic compounds. The use of the Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan is anticipated to allow for longer administration durations and slower infusion rates, potentially enabling clinicians to safely achieve a higher dose intensity of pre-transplant chemotherapy.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Acrotech Biopharma has marketing rights worldwide excluding China and CASI Pharmaceuticals has rights to market in China. We are eligible to receive over $50 million in potential milestone payments under this agreement, royalties on global net sales of the Captisol-enabled melphalan product and revenue from Captisol material sales. Acrotech and CASI’s obligation to pay royalties will expire at the end of the life of the relevant patents or when a competing product is launched, whichever is earlier, but in no event before ten years after the commercial launch. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of melphalan are not expected to expire until 2033. As described herein, we have entered into a settlement agreement with Teva and Acrotech Biopharma (the holder of the NDA for Evomela) which will allow Teva to market a generic version of Evomela in the United States in 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. The agreement may be terminated by either party for an uncured material breach or unilaterally by Acrotech and CASI by prior written notice.

Manufacturing
We contract with a third party manufacturer, Hovione, for Captisol production. Hovione operates FDA-inspected sites in the United States, Macau, Ireland and Portugal. Manufacturing operations for Captisol are performed primarily at Hovione's Portugal and Ireland facilities. We believe we maintain adequate inventory of Captisol to meet our current partner needs and that our Captisol capacity will be sufficient to meet future partner needs.
In the event of a Captisol supply interruption, we are permitted to designate and, with Hovione’s assistance, qualify one or more alternate suppliers. If the supply interruption continues beyond a designated period, we may terminate the agreement. In addition, if Hovione cannot supply our requirements of Captisol due to an uncured force majeure event, we may also obtain Captisol from a third party and have previously identified such parties.
The current term of the agreement with Hovione is through December 2024. The agreement will automatically renew for successive two year renewal terms unless either party gives written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement no less than two years prior to the expiration of the initial term or renewal term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party or an extended force majeure event. We may terminate the agreement for extended supply interruption, regulatory action related to Captisol or other specified events. We have ongoing minimum purchase commitments under the agreement.
Competition
Some of the drugs we and our licensees and partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors.
Our Captisol business may face competition from other suppliers of similar cyclodextrin excipients or other technologies that are aimed to increase solubility or stability of APIs. 
Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
