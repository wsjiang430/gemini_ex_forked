ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
Infinera Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our” or “Infinera”) is a global supplier of networking solutions comprised of networking equipment, software and services. Our portfolio of solutions includes optical transport platforms, converged packet-optical transport platforms, optical line systems and disaggregated router platforms, as well as software-defined networking (“SDN”), network management and routing software. 
Our customers include telecommunications service providers, Internet content providers (“ICPs”), cable providers, wholesale carriers, research and education institutions, large enterprises and government entities. Our networking solutions enable our customers to deliver business and consumer communications services. Our comprehensive portfolio of networking solutions also enable our customers to scale their transport networks as end-user services and applications demand for network bandwidth continues to grow. These end-user services and applications include, but are not limited to, high-speed Internet access, business Ethernet services, 4G/5G mobile broadband, cable high-speed Internet distribution, cloud-based services, high-definition video streaming services, virtual and augmented reality and the Internet of Things (“IoT”).
Our systems are highly scalable, flexible and designed with open networking principles for ease of deployment. We build our systems using a combination of internally manufactured and third party components. Our portfolio includes systems that leverage our innovative optical engine technology, comprised of large-scale photonic integrated circuits (“PICs”) and digital signal processors (“DSPs”). We optimize the manufacturing process by using indium phosphide to build our PICs, which enables the integration of hundreds of optical functions onto a set of semiconductor chips. This large-scale integration of our PICs and advanced DSPs allows us to deliver high-performance transport networking platforms with features that customers care about the most, including cost per bit, low power consumption and space savings. In addition, we design our optical engines to increase the capacity and reach performance of our products by leveraging coherent optical transmission. With the addition of new products to our portfolio, we plan to integrate our optical engine technology into a broader set of transport platforms in order to enhance customer value and lower production costs.
Over the past several years, we expanded our portfolio of solutions, evolving from our initial focus on the long-haul and subsea optical transport markets to offering a more complete suite of packet-optical networking solutions that address multiple markets within the end-to-end transport infrastructure. These markets include metro access, metro aggregation and switching, data center interconnect (“DCI”), long-haul and subsea. 
We have grown our portfolio through internal development as well as acquisitions. In 2014, we introduced the Infinera Cloud Xpress to address the emerging DCI market opportunity. In 2015, we entered the metro market with the acquisition of Transmode AB (“Transmode”), a leader in metro packet-optical applications. On October 1, 2018, we expanded our product portfolio and customer base through the acquisition of Coriant (the “Acquisition”), a privately-held global supplier of open network solutions for the largest global network operators. The Acquisition positions us as one of the largest providers of vertically integrated transport networking solutions in the world, enhances our ability to serve a global customer base and accelerates delivery of the innovative solutions our customers demand. This Acquisition also positions us to expand the breadth of customer applications we can address, including metro aggregation and switching, disaggregated transport and routing, and software-enabled multi-layer network management and control. 
In 2018, the majority of our product revenue was derived from transport systems built on the Infinite Capacity Engine (ICE), our optical engine technology. Our Infinite Capacity Engine enables different subsystems that can be customized for a variety of network applications in different transport markets, including the metro, DCI, long-haul and subsea markets. ICE4, our most recent technology generation, delivers multi-terabit opto-electronic subsystems powered by our fourth-generation PIC and latest generation FlexCoherent DSP (the combination of which we market as “ICE4”).
Our products are designed to be managed by a suite of software solutions that enable end-to-end common network management, multi-layer service orchestration, and automated operations. We also provide software-enabled programmability that offers differentiated capabilities such as Instant Bandwidth (“IB”). IB, combined with our differentiated hardware solutions, enables our customers to purchase and activate bandwidth as needed through our unique software licensing feature set. This, in turn, allows our customers to accomplish two key objectives: (1) limit their initial network startup costs and investments; and (2) instantly activate new bandwidth as their customers’ and their own network needs evolve.

We believe our portfolio of solutions benefits our customers by providing a unique combination of highly scalable capacity and features that address various applications and ultimately simplify and automate packet-optical network operations.
We were incorporated in December 2000 and originally operated under the name “Zepton Networks.” We are incorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 140 Caspian Court, Sunnyvale, CA 94089. Our telephone number is (408) 572-5200. “Infinera,” “Infinera DTN-X,” “FlexCoherent,” “Infinera Groove,” “Infinera mTera,” “Infinera DRX,” “Infinera Aware,” “Infinera Transcend,” “Infinera FlexILS,” “Infinera Instant Bandwidth” and the Infinera logo, are trademarks or service marks of Infinera Corporation in the United States, certain other countries and/or the European Union. Any other trademarks or trade names mentioned are the property of their respective owners.
Industry Background
Optical transport networking equipment carries digital information using light waves over fiber optic cables. With the advent of wavelength division multiplexing (“WDM”) systems, data is transmitted by using multiple wavelengths of light using different frequencies or colors over a single optical fiber. Customers deploy WDM systems to carry information between continents, across countries, between cities and within metropolitan areas, and in some cases all the way to the end-user. Fiber optic networks are generally capable of carrying most types of communications traffic. We believe that a number of trends in the communications industry are driving demand for large amounts of network bandwidth and ultimately will increase demand for packet-optical transport networking systems and software. These trends include:

• | growth of cloud services;


• | growth of over-the-top services and high-definition video streaming;


• | growth of mobile broadband services, including 4G and emerging 5G services;


• | increasing use of connected virtual and augmented reality devices; and


• | the IoT, which continues to drive massive growth in the number of network-connected devices.

As network traffic grows, customers add transmission capacity to existing optical networks or deploy new systems to address bandwidth demands and offer expanded services to end-users. 
We believe we are in the midst of two significant shifts in transport network architectures that impact the markets we serve. The first is the bifurcation of the traditional transport market into either a cloud-based model or a more traditional carrier model. Cloud-based architectures are characterized by transport networks optimized to handle the massive growth of server-to-server traffic between data center sites, and public Internet user-to-data traffic as deployed by traditional service providers. To manage server-to-server traffic growth, our customers seek open, scalable and disaggregated transport solutions designed to accommodate point-to-point, high-capacity traffic patterns. These customers require solutions that are cost-optimized for low power consumption, reduced footprint and ease of deployment. In contrast, traditional service providers require high capacity solutions with more integrated network platforms, which can provide multi-service capabilities and aggregate data flows, and can perform traffic add/drop at various points across their networks. These customers require protection schemes and a larger variety of interfaces to address their end customer needs. Our solutions serve both the point-to-point applications driven by increasing data center traffic and the more traditional mesh-oriented switched transport networks. 
A second shift is happening at the edge of the network, where fiber is increasingly being deployed closer to the end- user. This trend is frequently referred to as “Fiber Deep,” and occurs in primarily two types of access networks: 4G/5G mobile transport networks and next-generation cable and multiple system operator (“MSO”) networks. Both of these trends require cost-efficient scalability, higher density and lower power per bit networking devices with integrated packet switching capabilities. 
In all of these transport applications, we believe our customers seek the following solutions to increase their revenue, expand their service offerings and lower the total cost of operations:

• | high-bandwidth solutions that scale optical transmission capacity to meet increasing bandwidth demand while providing efficiency through service granularity;


• | efficient solutions with the right mix of disaggregated and integrated systems that optimize performance and increase reliability while reducing physical space and power consumption, leading to lower operational and capital expenses;


• | easy-to-use solutions that are highly programmable, open, and automated, which help reduce the time and complexity of deploying new transmission bandwidth;


• | improved integration between Ethernet or Internet Protocol equipment such as switches or routers, and optical transport networking equipment; and

2


• | strong encryption at the transport layer processed using hardware at line-rate speeds.

Strategy
Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of end-to-end transport networking solutions in the world by delivering the highest performance and lowest total cost solutions for our customers. Key aspects of our strategy include:

• | Leveraging our vertically integrated solutions to deliver lowest total cost network solutions. We will continue to provide our customers differentiated value by leveraging our vertically integrated optical engine. This value includes significant cost advantages that our innovative PIC and DSP technology enable, including service agility, spectral efficiency, optical performance leadership and reliability, industry-leading optical scalability and high-density and ultra-power efficient platforms. Our strategy is to continue to evolve our unique optical technology with higher speed and increasingly efficient solutions, integrating our optical engine across a broader end-to-end portfolio set and extending this innovation to the edge of the network.


• | Driving cost structure optimization and achieving cost advantages of scale. Leveraging scale as part of our vertical integration strategy, which includes integration of our optical engine across a broader set of platforms, enables us to achieve cost advantages and cost structure efficiencies that enhance our ability to continue to invest in research and development in our optical engine and end-to-end portfolio, as well as drive profitability. In particular, we believe our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities serve as a competitive advantage from a technology and supply chain perspective, and financially, enable a lower cost structure and thus, higher profitability.


• | Offering comprehensive networking solutions and expanding our go-to-market reach. We believe a broad and integrated solutions portfolio spanning multi-layer technologies and optimized for edge-to-core transport markets is critical to helping our customers most cost effectively provide services with new 5G, Distributed Access Architecture, DCI, cloud and business services. By expanding our solutions portfolio and leveraging application-optimized capabilities and disruptive innovation, we are able to expand our go-to-market reach and address a broader set of our customers’ transport applications, from core network scalability to packet- and application-optimized metro transport.


• | Delivering a superior customer experience. Our success will continue to be driven by our commitment to providing a superior experience to all customers. In addition to product delivery capability that efficiently and predictably delivers innovative technology and high-quality products to market, we bring value to our customers by providing end-to-end solutions with differentiation that includes usage-based bandwidth provisioning, service agility and ease-of-use that accelerates time-to-revenue. Additionally, our global customer services team is committed to making our customers successful by providing the highest quality support services that help our customers deploy, operate and maintain their networks. We believe our technology leadership combined with our ability to provide the most reliable products and a differentiated customer experience contribute to customer success and represent major differentiators.


• | Utilizing software-driven automation and cognitive networking to deliver differentiated solutions. We believe we lead the industry in ease of use and automation, both integrated into our system design and facilitated by our software capabilities. We continue to invest in our differentiated technologies, including enhancing capabilities of IB offerings and introducing cognitive networking capabilities. In particular, we believe that our IB offerings offer customers a uniquely positive user experience and also are a key element of delivering differentiated financial results. We are extending management and control capabilities across our entire product portfolio with the addition of a new orchestration solution following the Acquisition. This new solution enables customers to utilize end-to-end network resources and the automation of multi-layer and multi-vendor networks. Additionally, based on customers’ desire for more programmable networks, we have added open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) to our solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and customized automated operations.

Customers
Our customer verticals include:

• | Tier-1 carriers for domestic and international networks;


• | Tier-2 and Tier-3 carriers;


• | ICP and data center operators;


• | cable providers and MSOs;


• | wholesale carriers;

3


• | submarine network operators;


• | large enterprise customers;


• | research and education; and


• | government entities.

We sell our products directly to customers who are end-users and to channel partners that sell on our behalf. We do not have long-term sales commitments from our customers. One customer accounted for approximately 13% and 18% of our revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. This customer completed a merger with another customer in 2017 and these two historically larger customers each individually accounted for approximately 16% and 8% of our revenue in 2016, respectively. One other customer accounted for approximately 15% of our revenue in 2018. No other customers accounted for over 10% of our revenue for 2017 or 2016.
Technology
We were founded with a vision of enabling an infinite pool of intelligent bandwidth powered by software-enabled on-demand service provisioning. We have focused our efforts and capital on developing application-optimized platforms that enable customers to create rich end-user experiences delivered through efficient, high-bandwidth packet-optical transport characterized by the following attributes:

• | Scalable. The proliferation of data centers, rise of cloud computing, increasing consumption of video and growth in mobile access is fundamentally changing traffic characteristics in operator networks. We currently deliver terabit class coherent, sliceable super-channels, which allow a massive pool of bandwidth to be provisioned in a single operation.


• | Flexible. In addition to providing our customers end-to-end solutions, we offer a mix of integrated and disaggregated platforms to reduce complexity and enable flexibility as transport network architectures evolve. There are varying customer preferences as some customers continue to favor integrated multi-service mesh networks while others, such as ICPs, favor disaggregated platforms that address point-to-point connections.


• | Open. Network operators are facing intensifying competition to meet customer demand for immediate bandwidth and better visibility into the network. Our networking solutions feature highly programmable platforms with SDN APIs enabling networks to be open; this simplifies end-to-end, multi-layer service provisioning and network control.

Infinera Optical Engines
We believe our optical engines, with the latest version being ICE4, are key to our value proposition and a competitive advantage to our system solutions. Technologically, we are able to deliver multi-terabit class coherent super-channels through PICs in systems that significantly exceed reliability standards. Additionally, our DSPs enable network operators to utilize coherent technologies to enable higher data capacity transmissions over existing optical fiber infrastructure. We have integrated advanced coherent technologies onto our FlexCoherent DSP in ICE4, such as cutting-edge Nyquist subcarriers and soft-decision forward error correction gain sharing techniques. We use third-party components for specific applications, such as DCI and multi-service packet-optical transport within our metro platforms. Financially, we believe our technology approach enables improved manufacturing economics for optical networking, allowing future optical transport cost reductions to be viably sustained on a cost curve defined by volume manufacturing efficiencies and greater functional integration. These advantages allow us to develop new cost-effective architectures to allow our customers to solve their business needs.
Infinera Super-Channels and Sliceable Photonics
We offer customers flexibility in deploying WDM by using single or multiple channels simultaneously. Infinera’s DTN-X and Cloud Xpress Family of products, for example, are designed to support multiple channels, each up to 200 gigabits per second (“Gb/s”) capacity, in a single line card or unit depending on the platform form factor. This pool of bandwidth can either be managed as a single super-channel, with up to 1.2 terabits per second (“Tb/s”) that can be deployed in a single operation, or sliced into smaller increments to allow operators more flexibility. Super-channels result in competitive advantages leading to lower operational costs and long-term system reliability, as well as significant reductions in installation time. Our ICE4 technology combines the benefits of super-channels with the capability of being able to slice capacity into smaller unit increments such as 100 Gb/s. Each increment can be tuned and routed in multiple separate directions, with each fully tuned to its own flexible grid frequency as well as having its own coherent modulation profile. This significantly reduces the number of modules required in networks, resulting in lower total cost of ownership. The Infinera Groove G30 solution, a new addition to our portfolio following the Acquisition, provides a single-channel transmission solution up to 600 Gb/s. Both the single and super-channel approaches allow customers to tailor networks to their specific needs.

Infinera Instant Bandwidth
Infinera Instant Bandwidth enables customers to license a super-channel pool of bandwidth in smaller increments such as 100 Gb/s. With IB technology, which is available on the Infinera DTN-X XTC Series, DTN-X XT Series, DTN-X XTS Series, Cloud Xpress Family and XTM Series platforms, customers can provision additional transmission capacity on demand without the deployment of any incremental equipment. Our IB technology is uniquely enabled by our hardware, providing customers the ability to adopt a success-based business model for network growth.
Infinera CloudWave T Optics 
Infinera CloudWave T Optics is a coherent detection interface technology leveraged by the Infinera Groove G30 that features a flexible sled-based architecture designed to support pay-as-you-grow network scalability. The CloudWave T Optics solution leverages technologies acquired through the Acquisition and is based on third-party components that provide rapid go-to-market capabilities for 600 Gb/s transmission. The CloudWave T solution also enables low initial costs, reduces sparing costs, and supports cost-effective growth as capacity demands increase over time.
Infinera Aware Technology
Infinera’s Aware technology enables network operators to maximize the capacity of each wavelength while speeding the activation of new wavelengths, thus allowing our customers to accelerate time to revenue. It does this by providing the real-time residual margin of each wavelength and generates the valid parameter options enabling the best options to be automatically selected by the management system. Infinera Aware speeds the activation of new wavelengths by enabling accurate, real-time wavelength planning in the Infinera Transcend Software Suite with optical transmission reach and capacity that matches, or even exceeds, that of best-in-class offline planning tools.
Infinera Pluggable Optical Layer
A key enabler of the Infinera Groove G30 open line system and the Infinera 7100 optical layer, our Pluggable Optical Layer technology enables our customers to mix and match optical layer functions. The solution also enables our customers to meet and optimize the requirements of their networks in the short term, while providing the ability to add functionality over time as needs evolve. As a result, customers can minimize capital expense, footprint and power consumption. This value is provided by collapsing optical layer functions into compact pluggables that address a wide range of transport applications.
Infinera Disaggregated Routing
 Compared to traditional closed and proprietary chassis-based routers, our open and disaggregated routing technology reduces vendor lock-in, speeds innovation, lowers costs and removes the chassis backplane and number of slots as barriers to cost-optimized scaling. Our disaggregated router solution is comprised of hardware-independent, carrier-class routing software, which we market as converged network operating system (“CNOS”), and the Infinera DRX series of packet switching white boxes that support capacities from 300 Gb/s to 9.6 Tb/s in one or two rack unit (“RU”) form factor platforms.

In the metro market, we face the same competitors as in long-haul, plus Cisco, Adva Optical Networking and ECI. In the DCI market we also face competition from vendors that are selling optical components directly to customers as opposed to WDM systems. In addition to our current competitors, other companies have, or may in the future, develop products that are, or could be, competitive 
8

with our products. We also may encounter competitor consolidation in the markets in which we compete, which could lead to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, and could impact our results of operations.
Some of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition, technical, financial and marketing resources, and better-established relationships with potential customers than we have. Many of our competitors have more resources and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies, and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies. In addition, many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively. Further, many of our competitors have built long-standing relationships with some of our prospective and existing customers, and have the ability to provide financing to customers and could, therefore, have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell our products and related support services primarily through our direct sales force, supported by marketing and product management personnel. We also use distribution or support partners to enter new markets or when requested by a potential customer. Our sales team has significant experience with the buying process and sales cycles typical of high-value telecommunications products.
The sales process for our products entails discussions with prospective customers, analyzing their networks and identifying how they can utilize our systems capabilities within their networks. This process requires developing strong customer relationships and leveraging our sales force and customer support capabilities.
Over the course of the sales cycle, potential customers often test our products before buying. Prior to commercial deployment, the customer will generally perform a field trial of our products. Upon successful completion, the customer generally accepts the products installed in its network and may continue with commercial deployment of additional products. We anticipate that our sales cycle, from initial contact with a prospective customer through the signing of a purchase agreement may, in some cases, take several quarters.
Direct Sales Force. Our sales team sells directly to service providers worldwide. We maintain a sales presence throughout the United States, as well as in a number of international locations, including Argentina, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Adding incremental sales headcount in the future is expected to be success-based and in support of new customer accounts or expansion of existing ones.
Indirect Sales Force. We employ business consultants and resale and logistics partners to assist in our sales efforts, primarily in new regions for us whereby these partners have deep knowledge of typical business practices and strong relationships with key local operators. We expect to work with business partners to assist our customers in the sale, deployment and maintenance of our systems and have entered into distribution and resale agreements to facilitate the sale and support of our products.
Marketing and Product Management. Our product management team is responsible for defining the product features and go-to-market plan required to maximize our success in the marketplace. Product management supports our sales efforts with product and application expertise. Our corporate marketing team works to create demand for our products by communicating our value proposition and differentiation through direct customer interaction, public relations, attendance at tradeshows and other events, as well as Internet programs and other marketing channels.
Research and Development
Continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. To this end, we have a team of engineers with expertise in various fields, including systems, sub-systems, software and components. Our research and development efforts are currently focused in Sunnyvale, California; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Bangalore, India; Kanata, Canada; Stockholm, Sweden; Munich, Germany; Lisbon, Portugal; Shanghai, PRC; Espoo, Finland; and Naperville, Illinois. We utilize a mix of internal resources and supplement our staffing with development personnel provided by third parties on a contract basis. We have invested significant time and financial resources into the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products. We will continue to expand our product offerings and the capabilities of existing products in the future and plan to dedicate significant resources to these continued research and development efforts. We are continually increasing the scalability and software features of our current platforms. As part of the integration efforts related to the Acquisition, we are integrating the legacy Infinera and Coriant products into a seamless end-to-end portfolio; and we are investing in leveraging the vertical integration capabilities of Infinera into the legacy Coriant platforms. We are also working to develop new generations of optical engines at a faster cadence than we have historically in order to bring new products to market faster and meet customer demand. We believe these efforts will enhance our competitiveness in the markets we currently serve and also allow us to address adjacent markets to fuel our future growth.

Employees
As of December 29, 2018, we had 3,876 employees. A total of 2,583 of those employees were located outside of the United States. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions may be represented by local workers’ councils and/or collective bargaining agreements, as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our employee relationships to be good.
Manufacturing
We have invested significant time and capital to develop and improve the manufacturing processes we use to produce and package our products. This includes significant investments in personnel, equipment and the facilities needed to manufacture and package our products in Sunnyvale, California, Berlin, Germany and Allentown, Pennsylvania. We also have invested in automating our manufacturing process and in training and maintaining the quality of our manufacturing workforce. As a leader in the development of photonic integration, our manufacturing processes have been developed over several years and are protected through a combination of trade secrets, patents and contractual protections. We believe that the investments we have made towards the manufacturing and packaging of our products provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that our current manufacturing facilities, including our fabrication facility for our PICs in Sunnyvale, California, and our module manufacturing facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania can accommodate an increase in production capacity as our business continues to grow.
            We also use contract manufacturers to assemble portions of our products. Each contract manufacturer procures components necessary to assemble products according to our specifications and bills of material. For elements of our business where we outsource, we perform rigorous in-house quality control testing to ensure the reliability of our products. Our supply chain risk mitigation strategies are continuous and institutionalized in our supply chain design for external manufacturing and for procurement of components. We currently use four contract manufacturers in several different countries, including Germany, China, Malaysia, Mexico, Sweden, Hungary and Thailand, and we maintain the capability to redirect manufacturing to U.S. qualified factories of three electronic manufacturing services partners.
We expect all suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which addresses the rights of workers to safe and healthy working conditions, environmental responsibility, and compliance with applicable laws.
Backlog
As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, our total order backlog was approximately $374.3 million and $100.9 million, respectively. Our backlog represents purchase orders received from customers for future product shipments and services to be provided in future periods. More than half of our total order backlog is related to services, comprised primarily of annual maintenance contracts. The significant increase in backlog at the end of 2018 was primarily due to the inclusion of the Coriant business as a result of the Acquisition. Our backlog is subject to future events that could cause the amount or timing of the related revenue to change, and, in certain cases, may be canceled without penalty. Orders in backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following order receipt and may relate to multi-year support service obligations. As a result, we believe that backlog should not be viewed as an accurate indicator of future operating results for any particular period. A backlogged order may not result in revenue in a particular period, and the actual revenue may not be equal to our backlog amounts. Our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with that of other companies in our industry.
Intellectual Property
We believe our success depends upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.
Our optical engine technology, including our PIC, DSP, module and related technologies, are protected through a combination of patents, trade secrets and contractual protections. However, there can be no assurances that these protections will be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage or that others have not or will not reverse engineer our designs or discover, develop or disclose the same or similar designs and manufacturing processes.
As of December 29 2018, we held 1,071 U.S. patents and 684 international patents expiring between 2019 and 2038, and held 185 U.S. and 177 foreign pending patent applications. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims.
We may not receive any competitive advantages from the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property. Any patents granted to us may be contested, circumvented or invalidated over the course of our 
10

business, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing these patents. Therefore, the impact of these patents cannot be predicted with certainty.
We believe that the frequency of assertions of patent infringement is increasing as patent holders, including entities that are not in our industry and who purchase patents as an investment or to monetize such rights by obtaining royalties, use such actions as a competitive tactic as well as a source of additional revenue. For example, we are currently involved in litigation for alleged patent infringement. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” for additional information regarding these lawsuits. Any claim of infringement from a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claims, and could distract our management from running our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or could include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.
In addition to trade secret and patent protections, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary software and other confidential information. This protection is accomplished through a combination of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and through a combination of U.S. and international copyright laws.
We license some of our software pursuant to agreements that impose restrictions on our customers’ ability to use such software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by relying on non-disclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreements with our employees and consultants that acknowledge our exclusive ownership of all intellectual property developed by the individual during the course of his or her work with us. The agreements also require that each person maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary information disclosed to them. Other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us, and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. We also rely on contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products.
We incorporate free and open source licensed software into our products. Although we monitor our use of such open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, non-compliance with open source software license terms and conditions could subject us to potential liability, including intellectual property infringement and or contractual claims. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished in a timely manner, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Environmental Matters
We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products and services. Our business and operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive, Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”), and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations adopted by the European Union. Environmental regulation is increasing and we expect that our operations will be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which may expose us to additional costs. We are also subject to disclosure requirements related to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products. To date, our compliance costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
