Item 1. Business. 
Our Company 
 We are a bank holding company headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Our commercial banking activities are operated through Open Bank, our banking subsidiary. We offer commercial banking services to small and medium-sized businesses, their owners and retail customers with a focus on the Korean-American community. Having grown our branch and loan production office network over the past eight years, we now operate through eight full service branches located in the greater metropolitan area of Los Angeles, California, Orange County, California, and Santa Clara County, and five loan production offices in the Korean-American communities in Atlanta, Georgia, Aurora, Colorado, Dallas, Texas, and Lynnwood and Seattle, Washington. We opened our newest branch in Santa Clara, California in the second quarter of 2018, and we intend to open a full service branch in Carrollton, Texas in the second quarter of 2019. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had consolidated total assets of $1.04 billion, total deposits of $ 905.2 million, total loans outstanding (net of allowance for loan losses) of $ 865.4 million, and total shareholders’ equity of $129.8 million. We completed our initial public offering in March 2018 and our common stock was listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. 
 We believe that we provide our customers with a high degree of service, convenience and the financial products they need to achieve their financial objectives, by offering a customer-oriented product mix, competitive pricing, and convenient locations. Our lending activities are diversified and include CRE, commercial and industrial, SBA, home mortgage, and consumer loans. We generally lend in markets where we have a physical presence through our branch and loan production offices. We attract retail deposits through our branch network which offers a wide range of deposit products for business and consumer banking customers. We offer a multitude of other products and services to our customers to complement our lending and deposit business. 
 We have a strong, values-based corporate culture rooted in personal community-based relationship banking that permeates throughout our entire organization. We strive to provide quality customer service that exceeds our customers’ expectations. We also heavily invest in our Korean-American communities through our annual contributions to the Open Stewardship Foundation. We believe that customers value a banking partner knowledgeable about their business needs with a willingness and commitment to reinvest back into the community. We convey to our customers that banking with us indirectly provides them an opportunity to contribute to the community. We believe our strategic approach creates opportunities for expanding our banking relationships with new and existing customers who value personalized attention, local decision making and view us as an alternative to the large consolidated Korean-American financial institutions. 
 We established the Open Stewardship Foundation in 2011 to actively support civic organizations, schools and other eligible charitable non-profit organizations that provide public benefit services in the communities we serve. The Foundation operates through a board of directors that includes individuals who are members of our board of directors and executive management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman of the Board. The Foundation board of directors reviews and approves award grants. We have committed to contribute annually 10% of our consolidated net income after taxes to the Foundation. Since inception, we have donated over $3.9 million to the Foundation, aiding over 150 local non-profits.
 We plan to continue to leverage our experienced management team, our personal relationship community banking focus in the attractive Korean-American communities in which we serve, and our diversified lending approach to drive future organic growth. While other institutions frequently enter new geographies through acquisitions, we have grown our geographic footprint through de novo branches while remaining true to our business model. We intend to continue our organic growth while further diversifying our geographical concentration with the anticipated expansion in Carrollton, Texas in the second quarter of 2019, our first full service branch in Texas. We also are targeting markets where we have loan production offices for future expansion and development of de novo branches. Supplementing deposit products to our borrowers in those markets provides the profitability to support the investment in full service branches. Although our growth has historically been organic, we are amenable to considering opportunistic strategic acquisitions to enhance our long-term growth strategy.

Our Strategies 
 Our vision is to be the leading Korean-American community-based commercial bank in the Korean-American communities we serve, to meet the financial needs of underserved small and medium-sized business and individuals, and to give back to these communities. 
 Our more specific strategic initiatives are discussed below. 
 
 
• | Leverage our Franchise in the Korean-American Communities We Serve. The Korean-American banking landscape has seen increased consolidation of the larger Korean-American financial institutions that do business in our market areas. We believe that the customers at these larger institutions will look for an alternative banking experience that is tailored towards their specific financial objectives and we strive to be the most prominent alternative to the larger Korean-American financial institutions. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by developing meaningful and personal relationships with our customers, combined with a superior level of service to make Open Bank an attractive choice for small to medium-sized businesses, professionals and individuals. Our strong financial performance and growth derives in part for the desire by small and medium-sized businesses and individuals for quality personal relationship banking, local and responsive decision making and flexible and competitive pricing of deposit and loan products. Our commitment to the Open Stewardship Foundation raises our profile and reinforces our position as a community partner committed to the success of the communities we serve. We convey to our customers that banking with us provides them with an indirect opportunity to contribute to the community. In addition, we have invested in developing a distinct corporate culture guided by a core set of values. These values underlie everything we do, including the way we engage with customers, collaborate with colleagues, do business and manage our resources. We believe our commitment to our communities, culture and quality of our people have been catalysts of our success and will continue to propel our future.

• | Focus on Organic Growth. We intend to grow organically and believe the markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial customer base and increase our market share. We believe that our overall capabilities, culture and opportunities for career growth will allow us to continue to attract talented and entrepreneurial commercial and retail bankers from larger Korean-American financial institutions. We also seek to offer our various banking products, including our deposit products, residential loan products and cash management services to our commercial loan and SBA borrowers, which we believe provides a basis for expanding our banking relationships. We believe we have built a scalable platform that will support our continual organic growth. Although we are currently focused on organic growth, we will also look for opportunistic strategic acquisitions that complement our commercial banking and the strong personal community-based relationship orientation of our franchise.

• | Increase our Share of Lower-Cost Deposits. We believe the quality of our deposit base and access to stable funding are key components of our success. We have a strong deposit base characterized by a high level of core deposits, high proportion of non-interest bearing accounts and relatively low funding costs. As of December 31, 2018, deposits accounted for 99.0% of total liabilities. Core deposits, which we define as all deposits excluding time deposits exceeding $250,000, constituted 81.9% of total deposits. Our cost of total deposits was 1.09% for the year ended December 31, 2018. We employ conventional marketing initiatives and advertising and leverage our community commitment activities to generate new accounts. Small businesses are a significant source of low cost deposits and represent opportunities for future growth. We believe that small business owners value our ability to provide convenience and access to local, responsive decision makers. Commercial accounts also generally have higher deposit balances and transaction volumes than individual deposit accounts. We believe that our convenient branch network, personal relationship-driven culture, diversified product offering, and flexible pricing allow us to accelerate deposit growth. We plan to continue investing in our franchise brand, our community reputation, employees, and product capabilities to further improve customer loyalty with a view toward growing our high quality deposit portfolio.

• | Branch Expansion. We intend to continue our strategy of opening and developing de novo branches particularly into Korean-American populated areas. We have pursued this growth strategy since the beginning of 2012 when we only had one branch location. As of December 31, 2018, we had eight branches. Seven branches are in the greater Los Angeles and Orange County, and we opened our first branch in northern California in Santa Clara, California in the second quarter of 2018. We anticipate opening a ninth branch in Carrollton, Texas in the second quarter of 2019. We will review future potential target areas for de novo expansion based on our ability to attract experienced bankers within such targeted regions. In addition, we currently operate five loan production offices located in Atlanta, Georgia, Aurora, Colorado, Dallas, Texas and Lynwood and Seattle, Washington, two of which we opened in February 2019. We will continue to look for additional markets to expand our loan production capabilities and, if we believe there are opportunities to develop deposit business in these markets, we may expand one or more loan production offices into de novo branches.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand and Diversify our Commercial Lending. We are committed to continuing to expand, and continue to grow our commercial loan portfolios while maintaining what we believe are conservative underwriting standards. We expect to expand our commercial lending business in our expanding branch network, where we can continue to leverage our ability to develop personal community-based relationships and leverage our quality service model into new opportunities. We believe we can leverage our personalized customer service, extensive knowledge of our local markets and high visibility community activities to attract and retain customers seeking alternatives to the larger Korean-American financial institutions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preserve Our Asset Quality Through Disciplined Lending Practices. Our approach to credit management uses well-defined policies and procedures, disciplined underwriting criteria and ongoing risk management. This approach has allowed us to maintain loan growth with a diversified portfolio of high quality assets. We believe our credit culture supports accountable bankers, who maintain an ability to expand our customer base as well as make sound decisions. As of December 31, 2018, our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.18% and our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.22%.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage Public Company Status. We believe becoming a public reporting company, while increasing our operating costs, will provide us with additional options and better pricing to manage our cost of capital. While we have not historically engaged in any merger and acquisition activity, the ability to issue publicly-traded stock as consideration may enable us to opportunistically approach potential transactions. In addition, we believe the additional liquidity provided by being listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and being a public reporting company will enhance the equity component of our compensation programs, which will enable us to better incent and retain key employees in the competitive markets in which we operate.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
 Our management team has identified the following competitive strengths that we believe will allow us to continue to achieve our principal objective of increasing shareholder value and generating consistent earnings growth through the organic and strategic expansion of our commercial banking franchise: 

• | Experienced Leadership and Management Team. Our experienced executive management team and senior leaders have exhibited the ability to strengthen shareholder value by consistently growing profitably. The members of our executive management team have, on average, more than 30 years’ experience working for large, billion-dollar-plus financial institutions in our markets during various economic cycles. They have been with Open Bank for an average of eight years, and substantially all have known and worked with our Chief Executive Officer, prior to joining Open Bank. Our executive management team has instilled a transparent and entrepreneurial culture that rewards leadership, innovation, and problem solving.

• | Personal Relationship-Based Customer Service. We strive to differentiate ourselves from our competition by providing the best “relationship-based” services to small- and medium-sized businesses and their owners and residents in the Korean-American communities in which we operate. We accomplish this by striving to provide our customers with a superior level of personal and responsive service delivered by experienced bankers in a manner that timely meets our customers’ financial objections. Our management team’s significant banking and lending experience in our markets has provided us with an understanding of the commercial banking needs of our customers, which allows us to tailor our products and services to meet our customers’ financial objectives. To enhance our relationships with our customers and to identify and meet their particular needs, each customer is assigned a relationship officer (including our SBA borrowers). Approximately 55% of our borrowers also have a deposit relationship with us, providing us with visibility into their liquidity profile and contributing to our ability to manage our asset quality.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Community Relationships. A primary mission of Open Bank is to meet the financial services needs of underserved customers in our markets, and we strive to distinguish ourselves by giving back to these communities. In October 2011, we established the Open Stewardship Foundation to actively support local civic organizations, schools, and public services. We have committed to fund the Foundation in an amount equal to 10% of our annual consolidated net income after taxes. This commitment is in our annual operating budget each year. We believe that our community commitment distinguishes us from our competitors and enhances and expands business relationships within the Korean-American communities we serve. Since inception, we have donated over $3.9 million to the Foundation, aiding over 150 local non-profits. Our management team has strong ties and relationships within the Korean-American communities where we operate. The Foundation and our employees and board of directors are involved in community activities that enhance our relationships with a variety of industry leadership groups, including the Korean-American Federation of Los Angeles, the Korean-American Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles, the Korean-American Manufacturers Association, the Korean-American CPA Society of Southern California, California KAGRO Association, and the Korean Real Estate Brokers Association of Southern California. Affiliation with these local organizations provide our management team with knowledge of local markets and industries, as well as market developments that may impact the evolving business environment in which we operate.

• | Strong Credit Quality. We have implemented policies and procedures for credit underwriting and administration which have enabled us to maintain strong asset quality while at the same time growing our banking business. As of December 31, 2018, our NPA as a percentage of total gross loans and OREO was 0.22%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Risk Management Practices. We place significant emphasis on risk management as an integral component of our organizational culture without sacrificing growth. We believe our comprehensive risk management system is designed to make sure that we have sound policies, procedures, and practices for the management of key risks under our risk framework (which includes market, operational, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity, credit, regulatory, legal and reputational risk) and that any exceptions to written policy are reported by senior management to our board of directors or audit committee. Our risk management practices are overseen by the chairman of our audit committee and the chairman of Open Bank’s risk and compliance committees, who have more than 20 years of combined banking experience, and our chief risk officer, who has more than 35 years of banking experience. We believe that our enterprise risk management philosophy has been important in gaining and maintaining the confidence of our various constituencies and growing our business and footprint within our markets. We also believe our strong risk management practices are manifested in our asset quality metrics.

• | Efficient and Scalable Platform with Capacity to Support Our Growth. Our management team has built an efficient and scalable corporate infrastructure within our commercial banking franchise, including the areas of banking processes, technology, data processing, underwriting and risk management, which we believe will support our continued growth. While expanding our infrastructure, several departmental functions have been outsourced to gain the experience of outside professionals while at the same time achieving more favorable economics and cost-effective solutions. Such outsourced areas include the internal audit function, investment securities management, and select loan review, interest rate risk management and stress testing. This outsourcing strategy is designed to control costs while adding enhanced controls and/or service levels. We believe that our scalable infrastructure will continue to allow us to efficiently and effectively manage our anticipated growth.

Market Area 
 We are headquartered in Los Angeles, California. We currently have one branch in the financial district of downtown Los Angeles and, directly adjacent to downtown Los Angeles, we have one branch in the fashion district and three branches in Koreatown. In addition, we operate a branch in Gardena, California and a branch in Buena Park, in Orange County, California. The economic base of the area is heavily dependent on small- and medium-sized businesses. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Asian-Americans accounted for 15.3% of the over 10.2 million residents in Los Angeles County as of July 1, 2017. We opened our first branch in northern California in Santa Clara, California in the second quarter of 2018. We plan to open a branch in Carrollton, Texas in the second quarter of 2019. We also operate loan production offices in Atlanta, Georgia, Aurora, Colorado, Dallas, Texas and Lynnwood and Seattle, Washington to support our SBA lending efforts. 
Deposit Products 
 We offer customers traditional retail deposit products through our branch network and the ability to access their accounts through online and mobile banking platforms. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and time deposits with the goal of attracting a wide variety of customers, including small to medium-sized businesses. We consider our core deposits, defined as all deposits except for time deposits exceeding $250,000, to be our primary and most valuable low-cost funding source for our lending business, and as of December 31, 2018, core deposits represented 81.9% of our total deposits. We strive to retain an attractive deposit mix from both large and small customers and a broad market reach, which has resulted in our top 10 customers accounting for only 8.0% of all deposits as of December 31, 2018. We believe our competitive pricing and products, convenient branch locations, and quality personal customer service enable us to attract and retain deposits. We employ conventional marketing initiatives and advertising and in addition leverage our community commitment activities, including our Foundation, to generate new accounts. Our bankers offer our deposit products to our loan customers. We typically require, depending on the circumstances and the type of relationship, our borrowers to maintain deposit accounts as a condition of granting loans. Approximately 55% of our borrowers also have a deposit relationship with us. Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals. We do utilize wholesale deposits to supplement our core retail deposits for funding purposes, including brokered accounts. As of December 31, 2018, wholesale deposits totaled $101.8 million, or 11.2% of total deposits. As of December 31, 2018, we had $905.2 million of deposits, and our cost of deposits was 1.09% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Lending Activities 
 Our lending strategy is to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio based on the type of customer (i.e., businesses versus individuals), type of loan product (e.g., owner occupied commercial real estate, commercial and industrial loans, etc.), geographic location and industries in which our business customers are engaged (e.g., manufacturing, retail, hospitality, etc.). We principally focus our lending activities on loans that we originate from borrowers located in our market areas. We seek to be the premier provider of lending products and services in our market areas and serve the credit needs of high-quality business and individual borrowers in the communities that we serve. 
 We offer a variety of loans, including CRE loans (including loans secured by owner occupied commercial properties), SBA loans, and commercial and industrial loans to local manufacturing and industrial companies and other businesses. We also offer various consumer loans to individuals and professionals including residential real estate loans, and unsecured personal lines of credit. Lending activities originate from the relationships and efforts of our bankers, with an emphasis on providing banking solutions tailored to meet our customers’ needs while maintaining our underwriting standards.

As of December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio held for investment consisted of the following:
 
 
 | December 31, 2018 | 
------------------------------------+------------------------+--------
 | (dollars in thousands) | 
Commercial real estate | $ | 503,834
Small business administration loans | | 127,375
Commercial and industrial | | 113,975
Home mortgage | | 127,298
Consumer | | 2,577 
Gross loans receivable | $ | 875,059

 For additional information concerning our loan portfolio, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition—Loan Portfolio.” 
 Concentrations of Credit Risk. Most of our lending activity is conducted with businesses and individuals in our market areas. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of CRE loans, which were $503.8million and constituted 57.6% of our total loans as of December 31, 2018, SBA loans, which were $127.4 million and constituted 14.6% of our total loans as of December 31, 2018, and commercial and industrial loans, including trade finance loans, which were $114.0 million and constituted 13.0% of our total loans as of December 31, 2018. Our commercial real estate loans are secured by first liens on real property. The remaining commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by general business assets, accounts receivable inventory, real estate and/or the corporate guaranty of the borrower and personal guaranty of its principals. The geographic concentration subjects the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within Southern California. The risks created by such concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. 
 Sound risk management practices and appropriate levels of capital are essential elements of a sound commercial real estate lending program. Concentrations of commercial real estate exposures add a dimension of risk that compounds the risk inherent in individual loans. Interagency guidance on commercial real estate concentrations describe sound risk management practices which include board and management oversight, portfolio management, management information systems, market analysis, portfolio stress testing and sensitivity analysis, credit underwriting standards, and credit risk review functions. Management believes it has implemented these practices in order to monitor concentrations in commercial real estate in our loan portfolio. 
 Large Credit Relationships. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of loans to our 10 and 25 largest borrowers (including related entities) amounted to approximately $124.6 million, or 14.2% of total loans, and $220.5 million, or 25.2% of total loans, respectively. 
 Loan Underwriting and Approval. Historically, we believe we have made sound, high quality loans while recognizing that lending money involves a degree of business risk. We have loan policies designed to assist us in managing this business risk. These policies provide a general framework for our loan origination, monitoring and funding activities, while recognizing that not all risks can be anticipated. Open Bank’s board of directors delegates loan authority up to board-approved limits collectively to its Loan & Credit Policy Committee, which is comprised of members of its board of directors. Our board of directors also delegates limited lending authority to our internal management loan committee, which is comprised of members of our executive management team. No individual at the Bank has sole loan approval authority. The objective of our approval process is to provide a disciplined, collaborative approach to larger credits while maintaining responsiveness to client needs.

Loan decisions are documented as to the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, evaluation of the repayment source and the associated risks, evaluation of collateral, covenants and monitoring requirements, and the risk rating rationale. Our strategy for approving or disapproving loans is to follow conservative loan policies and consistent underwriting practices which include: 
 
 
• | maintaining close relationships among our customers and their designated banker to ensure ongoing credit monitoring and loan servicing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | granting credit on a sound basis with full knowledge of the purpose and source of repayment for such credit;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing and maintaining targeted levels of diversification for our loan portfolio as a whole and for loans within each category; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ensuring that each loan is properly documented and that any insurance coverage requirements are satisfied.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Managing credit risk is an enterprise-wide process. Our strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all credit exposures. Our processes emphasize early-stage review of loans, regular credit evaluations and management reviews of loans, which supplement the ongoing and proactive credit monitoring and loan servicing provided by our bankers. Our Chief Credit Officer provides company-wide credit oversight and periodically reviews all credit risk portfolios to ensure that the risk identification processes are functioning properly and that our credit standards are followed. In addition, a third-party loan review is performed to assist in the identification of problem assets and to confirm our internal risk rating of loans. We attempt to identify potential problem loans early in an effort to seek aggressive resolution of these situations before the loans become a loss, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate allowance levels for probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. 
 Our loan policies generally include other underwriting guidelines for loans collateralized by real estate. These underwriting standards are designed to determine the maximum loan amount that a borrower has the capacity to repay based upon the type of collateral securing the loan and the borrower’s income. Such loan policies include maximum amortization schedules and loan terms for each category of loans collateralized by liens on real estate. 
 In addition, our loan policies provide guidelines for: personal guarantees; an environmental review; loans to employees, executive officers and directors; problem loan identification; maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses and other matters relating to lending practices. 
 Lending Limits. Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. In general, the Bank is subject to a legal lending limit on loans to a single borrower based on the Bank’s capital level. The dollar amounts of the Bank’s lending limit increases or decreases as the Bank’s capital increases or decreases. The Bank is able to sell participations in its larger loans to other financial institutions, which allows it to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of its customers that require extensions of credit in excess of these limits. 
 The Bank’s legal lending limit as of December 31, 2018 on loans to a single borrower was $34.9 million for secured loans and $20.9 million for unsecured loans, which are expected to increase following the consummation of this offering. 
 Our loan policies provide general guidelines for loan-to-value ratios that restrict the size of loans to a maximum percentage of the value of the collateral securing the loans, which percentage varies by the type of collateral. Our internal loan-to-value limitations follow limits established by applicable law.

We provide a variety of loans to meet our customers’ needs. The section below discusses our general loan categories: 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer commercial real estate loans collateralized by real estate, which may be owner occupied or non-owner occupied real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. We believe that our management team has extensive knowledge of our borrowers and the markets where we operate, and takes a conservative approach to commercial real estate lending, focusing on what we believe to be high quality credits with low loan-to-value ratios income-producing properties with strong cash flow characteristics, and strong collateral profiles. 
 We require our commercial real estate loans to be secured by what we believe to be well-managed property with adequate margins and we generally obtain a personal guarantee from responsible parties. Our commercial real estate loans are secured by professional office buildings, shopping centers, manufacturing facilities, and special purpose properties such as restaurants, retail operations and service stations. We originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate loans with terms up to 25 years. Fixed-rate loans have provisions that allow us to call the loan after five to seven years. Adjustable-rate loans are generally based on the prime rate and adjust with the prime rate. At December 31, 2018, approximately 55% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of fixed rate loans. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 70% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price depending on the property audits we utilize. 
 Our total commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $503.8 million at December 31, 2018. We had no non-performing commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2018. 
 Payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent on the successful operation (in the case of owner occupied real estate) or management (in the case of non-owner occupied real estate) of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans. In underwriting commercial real estate loans, we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, including giving careful consideration to the property’s age, condition, operating history, future operating projections, current and projected market rental rates, vacancy rates, location and physical condition. The underwriting analysis also may include credit verification, reviews of appraisals, environmental hazard reports, the borrower’s liquidity and leverage, management experience of the owners or principals, economic condition and industry trends. 
 Small Business Administration Loans. We offer SBA loans for qualifying businesses for loan amounts up to $5 million. The Bank primarily extends SBA loans known as SBA 7(a) loans and SBA 504 loans. SBA 7(a) loans are typically extended for working capital needs, purchase of inventory, purchase of machinery and equipment, debt refinance, business acquisitions, start-up financing or to purchase or construct owner-occupied commercial property. SBA 7(a) loans are typically term loans with maturities up to 10 years for loans not secured by real estate and up to 25 years for real estate secured loans. SBA loans are fully amortizing with monthly payments of principal and interest. SBA 7(a) loans are typically floating rate loans that are secured by business assets and/or real estate. Depending on the loan amount, each loan is typically guaranteed 75% to 85% by the SBA, with a maximum gross loan amount to any one small business borrower of $5 million and a maximum SBA guaranteed amount of $3.75 million. 
 We are generally able to sell the guaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market at a premium, while earning servicing fee income on the sold portion over the remaining life of the loan. In addition to the interest yield earned on the unguaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) loans that are not sold, we recognize income from gains on sales and from loan servicing on the SBA 7(a) loans that are sold. 
 SBA 504 loans are typically extended for the purpose of purchasing owner-occupied commercial real estate or long-term capital equipment. SBA 504 loans are typically extended for up to 20 years or the life of the asset being financed. SBA 504 loans are financed as a participation loan between the Bank and the SBA through a Certified Development Company (“CDC”). Generally, the loans are structured to give the Bank a 50% first deed of trust (“TD”), the CDC a 40% second TD, and the remaining 10% is funded by the borrower. Interest rates for the first TD Bank loans are subject to normal bank commercial rates and terms and the second TD CDC loans are fixed for the life of the loans based on certain indices.

All of our SBA loans are originated through our SBA Loan Department. The SBA Loan Department is staffed by loan officers who provide assistance to qualified businesses. The Bank has been designated as an SBA Preferred Lender, which is the highest designation awarded by the SBA. This designation generally facilitates a more efficient marketing and approval process for SBA loans. We have attained SBA Preferred Lender status nationwide. 
 We originate SBA loans through our branch staff, loan production officers, marketing officers and through SBA brokers. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our SBA loan portfolio totaled $ 127.4 million of non-guaranteed loans, $117.8 million of which was secured by real estate and $9.5 million of which was unsecured or secured by business assets. 
 Commercial and Industrial Business Loans. We have significant expertise in small to medium sized market commercial and industrial lending, including trade finance loans. We believe that our success is the result of our product and market expertise, and our focus on delivering high-quality, customized and quick turnaround service for our clients due to our focus on maintaining an appropriate balance between prudent, disciplined underwriting, on the one hand, and flexibility in our decision making and responsiveness to our clients, on the other hand, which has allowed us to grow our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, while maintaining strong asset quality. 
 We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial and industrial loans. The loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs, business expansions and for international trade financing. We extend commercial business loans on an unsecured and secured basis advanced for working capital, accounts receivable and inventory financing, machinery and equipment purchases, and other business purposes. Generally, short-term loans have maturities ranging from six months to one year, and “term loans” have maturities ranging from five to seven years. Loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments, with interest payable monthly. Term loans generally provide for floating interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest. Repayment of secured and unsecured commercial loans depends substantially on the borrower’s underlying business, financial condition and cash flows, as well as the sufficiency of the collateral. Compared to real estate, the collateral may be more difficult to monitor, evaluate and sell. Where the borrower is a corporation, partnership or other entity, we typically require personal guarantees from significant equity holders. 
 Our trade finance unit supplies financial needs to many of our commercial and industrial loan customers. The unit provides, international letters of credit, SWIFT, and export advice. Our trade finance unit has a correspondent relationship with many of the largest banks in South Korea. All of our international letters of credit, SWIFT, and export advice are denominated in U.S. dollars. 
 The total commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaled $114.0 million at December 31, 2018.  Our non-performing commercial and industrial loans as of December 31, 2018 were $1.02 million. 
 In general, commercial and industrial loans may involve increased credit risk and, therefore, typically yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial and industrial loans derives from the expectation that such loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Any interruption or discontinuance of operating cash flows from the business, which may be influenced by events not under the control of the borrower such as economic events and changes in governmental regulations, could materially affect the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In addition, the collateral securing commercial and industrial loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate exposing us to increased credit risk. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial and industrial loans require extensive underwriting and servicing. 
 Single-Family Residential Loans. We originate residential real estate loans collateralized by owner occupied and non-owner occupied properties located in our market areas to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes. We offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans with the interest rate fixed for the first five years followed by rate adjustments each year with terms up to 30 years. The relative amount of adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment and the effect each has on our interest rate risk. 
 11


Loans collateralized by single-family residential real estate generally are originated in amounts of no more than 70% of appraised value. In connection with such loans, we retain a valid lien on real estate, obtain a title insurance policy that insures that the property is free from encumbrances and require hazard insurance. 
 Loan fees on these products, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted annually based on the 1 year-LIBOR rate. 
 While single-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. In addition, all of the mortgage loans in our loan portfolio contain due-on-sale clauses providing that the Bank may declare the unpaid amount due and payable upon the sale of the property securing the loan. 
 The total single-family residential real estate loan portfolio totaled $127.3 million at December 31, 2018. We had non-performing single-family residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2018. 
 Consumer Loans. We offer unsecured lines of credit and term loans to high net worth individuals. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the individual borrower’s income, current debt level, and past credit history. The terms of consumer loans are up to seven years. Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential real estate loans because they are unsecured. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans. 
 The total consumer loan portfolio totaled $ 2.6 million at December 31, 2018. We had no non-performing consumer loans as of December 31, 2018. 
 The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history and the applicant’s credit worthiness. 
 Loan Participations. When loans exceed our lending limit, we as the lead bank will sell a portion of the loan in order to remain within our lending limit. We also sell loan participations to reduce risk and manage credit concentrations in particular businesses and industries. Banks with which we participate are generally located in California. We do not participate in syndicated loans (loans made by a group of lenders who share or participate in a specific loan) with a larger regional financial institution as the lead lender. 
Investment Activities 
 We manage our securities portfolio and cash to maintain adequate liquidity and to ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal, with a secondary focus on yield and returns. Specific goals of our investment portfolio are as follows: 

• | provide a ready source of balance sheet liquidity, ensuring adequate availability of funds to meet fluctuations in loan demand, deposit balances and other changes in balance sheet volumes and composition;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | serve as a tool to manage asset-quality diversification of our assets; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide a vehicle to help manage our interest rate risk profile pursuant to our established policies and maximize our overall return.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With the exception of U.S. government agency issues and short term money market instruments, no one type or segment of security exceeds 40% of the portfolio. 
 12


Open Bank’s board of directors is responsible for the oversight of investment activities and has delegated the responsibility of monitoring our investment activities to the Asset/Liability Management Board Committee (“ALM”). Our investment policy is reviewed and approved annually by ALM and ratified by our board of directors. 
 ALM establishes risk limits and policy for conducting investment activities. ALM receives quarterly reports from management’s Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”), which approves investment strategies and meets monthly to review investment reports and monitor investment activities. ALCO receives investment related reports and any policy exceptions from the investment officer, who is appointed by ALM and responsible for ensuring compliance and implementation of investment policy guidelines. Day-to-day activities pertaining to the securities portfolio are conducted by the investment officer under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Controller. We actively monitor our investments on an ongoing basis to identify any material changes in the securities. We also review our securities for potential other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly. 
 Limits for investment transactions are based on total transaction amount and require approval if they exceed designated thresholds. Investment transactions up to $5 million require Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer approval. Investment transactions that exceed $5 million, up to $10 million, require ALCO approval and any investment transaction greater than $10 million must be pre-approved by ALM. 
 Other Products and Services 
 We offer banking products and services that are competitively priced with a focus on convenience and accessibility. We offer a full suite of online banking solutions including access to account balances, online transfers, online bill payment and electronic delivery of customer statements, mobile banking solutions for iPhone and Android phones, including remote check deposit with mobile bill pay. We offer ATMs and banking by telephone, mail and personal appointment. We offer debit cards with no ATM surcharges or foreign ATM fees for checking customers, direct deposit, cashier’s checks, as well as treasury management services, wire transfer services and automated clearing house (“ACH”) services. 
 We offer a full array of commercial treasury management services designed to be competitive with banks of all sizes. Treasury management services include balance reporting (including current day and previous day activity), transfers between accounts, wire transfer initiation, ACH origination and stop payments. Cash management deposit products consist of remote deposit capture, positive pay, zero balance accounts and sweep accounts. 
 We evaluate our services on an ongoing basis, and will add or remove services based upon the perceived needs and financial requirements of our customers, competitive factors and our financial and other capabilities. Future services may also be significantly influenced by improvements and developments in technology and evolving state and federal laws and regulations. 
 Competition 
 In our primary markets in Southern California, we view the Korean-American direct banking market competition, including Open Bank, as comprised of nine banks divided into four segments: large publicly-traded banks (two banks), medium-sized banks (two publicly-traded banks and one locally-owned bank), small locally-owned banks (two banks), and banks that are subsidiaries of Korean banks (two banks). Excluding two banks that are subsidiaries of Korean banks, all seven banks, including Open Bank, are based in California. As of December 31, 2018, we are the seventh-largest bank among this group of nine banks based on total assets. 
 In addition to Korean-American banks, we also compete with other banks in the region, particularly with Chinese-American banks in our market areas. In certain geographic markets where we currently operate, there is overlap between Chinese-American, Korean-American and other Asian-American banks for loan and deposit business. We aim to grow both organically and potentially through acquisitions in these markets. 
 13


The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. We compete for loan and deposit customers with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions, and other nonbank financial service providers. Many of these competitors, including the majority of the other Korean-American banks located in greater Los Angeles County, have a longer operating history, are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of financial services than we do. 
 Large commercial bank competitors have, among other advantages, the ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment resources to areas of highest yield and demand. Many of the major banks operating in our market area offer certain services, which we do not offer directly (but some of which we offer through correspondent institutions). By virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks also have substantially higher lending limits (restricted to a percentage of our total shareholders’ equity, depending upon the nature of the loan transaction) than us. 
 In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, thrift and loan companies and numerous non-banking institutions, such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms located in our primary market area. In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer money market and mutual funds, wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal finance software. We also face growing competition from so-called “online businesses” with few or no physical locations. Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers. 
 To the extent that we are affected by more general competitive trends in the industry, those trends are focused towards increased consolidation and competition. Strong competitors, other than financial institutions, have entered banking markets with focused products targeted at highly profitable customer segments. Many of these competitors are able to compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in nearly all significant products. Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues to remain competitive. 
 Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in the financial services industry. Such innovations have, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously have been considered traditional banking products. In addition, many customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mail, home computer, ATMs, self-service branches and/or in store branches. In addition to other banks, the sources of competition for such high-tech products include savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, money market and other mutual funds, asset management groups, finance and insurance companies, and mortgage banking firms. 
 Information Technology Systems 
 We have made and continue to make significant investments in our information technology systems and staff for our banking and lending operations and treasury management activities. We believe this investment will support our continued growth and enable us to enhance our capabilities to offer new products and overall customer experience, and to provide scale for future growth and acquisitions. We utilize a nationally recognized software vendor, and their support allows us to outsource our data processing. Our internal network and e-mail systems are outsourced to a third party and we have a back-up site at our Buena Park location. This back-up site provides for redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities. 
 The majority of our other systems including our electronic funds transfer, transaction processing and our online banking services are hosted by third-party service providers. The scalability of this infrastructure will support our growth strategy. In addition, the tested capability of these vendors to automatically switch over to standby systems should allow us to recover our systems and provide business continuity quickly in case of a disaster.

Coexistence Agreement between the Bank and Open Bank S.A. 
 We have not registered the trademark “Open Bank” under the trademark laws of the United States. Open Bank, S.A., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Spain with its principal office located in Ciudad Grupo Santander, Av. Catabria Boadilla del Monte Madrid Spain (“Open Bank S.A.”) originally registered the trademark “Open Bank” (U.S. Registration No. 3397518) in 2008 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Open Bank S.A. provides financial services in Spain and solicits financial services in the United States through the internet. Open Bank S.A. is not licensed to engage in banking services in the United States or California and to our knowledge in any other state in the United States. In February 2014, we entered into a Coexistence Agreement with Open Bank S.A. (the “Coexistence Agreement”), under which both parties agreed that we may use the name “Open Bank” in connection with banking and banking related services in the state of California and the cities of New York, Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, Seattle and Fort Lee, New Jersey (the “Permitted Markets”). We agreed to limit all of the Bank’s marketing, advertising, publicity, soliciting and or media efforts using the “Open Bank” name to primarily the Korean-American community in the Permitted Markets. However, we have the right under the Coexistence Agreement to market through the internet. The Coexistence Agreement states that these limitations are not intended to mean that we should in any way engage in discriminatory tactics or policy or in any way discriminate against non-Korean-American customers or potential customers. Under the Coexistence Agreement, Open Bank S.A. retains the right to use and market its services in relation to its registered trademark in any state or territory in the United States. We further agreed not to challenge Open Bank, S.A.’s trademark registration or any future applications by Open Bank S.A. The Coexistence Agreement has no termination date and is perpetual. If Open Bank S.A. decides to become a licensed bank in California or in any of the other Permitted Markets, depending on its business and marketing plan, there could be confusion created by the use of the name “Open Bank” which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to build its brand in the Permitted Markets. In addition, if Open Bank, S.A. were to assert that we breached the Coexistence Agreement, Open Bank, S.A. could file for an injunction, seek to have the Bank change its name or seek monetary damages, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. There are no approval rights of either party for any of the actions or no actions that either party may take under the Coexistence Agreement. To our knowledge Open Bank, S.A. has not initiated any business or marketing activities in the United States other than on the worldwide interest through its Spanish language website.

Supervision and Regulation
 General 
 We are extensively regulated under U.S. federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the DBO, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the CFPB. Furthermore, tax laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the FASB, securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or Treasury, and mortgage related rules, including with respect to loan securitization and servicing by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, also impact our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and rules are significant to our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. 
 Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of banks, their holding companies and their affiliates. These laws are intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund and bank customers rather than shareholders. Federal and state laws, and the related regulations of the bank regulatory agencies, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. 
 This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that, while not publicly available, can affect the conduct and growth of their businesses. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 
 The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and its subsidiary, the Bank. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. 
 Regulatory Capital Requirements
 The federal banking agencies have risk-based capital adequacy requirements intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the perceived degree of risk associated with a banking organization’s operations, both for transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and for transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, that are recorded as off-balance sheet items. In 2013, the bank regulatory agencies issued final rules (the “Basel III Capital Rules”) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules implement the Basel Committee’s December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules require the Bank comply with several minimum capital standards. The Bank must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0%; a common equity Tier 1, which we refer to as CET1, to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%; a Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0% and a total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%. 
 16


CET1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as CET1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (CET1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the ALL limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into CET1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). We exercised the opt-out election regarding the treatment of AOCI in part to avoid significant variations in the our capital levels resulting changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio as interest rates fluctuate. The calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that (i) mortgage servicing rights, (ii) deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and (iii) significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and would be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the Basel III Capital Rules limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of an additional 2.5% of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in over a four-year period beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625%, increasing by 0.625% each January 1 until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
 During 2018, banking organizations, including the Bank, are required to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.375%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 7.875%, and a total capital ratio of at least 9.875% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. When fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, the Bank will be required to meet minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%, a minimum CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 4.5% (7% with the capital conservation buffer), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% (8.5% including the capital conservation buffer) and a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0% (10.5% including the capital conservation buffer). 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, a bank’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on perceived risks inherent in the type of asset. As a result, higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien 1—4 family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. The Basel III Capital Rules increased the risk weights for a variety of asset classes, including certain CRE mortgages. Additional aspects of the Basel III Capital Rules’ risk weighting requirements that are relevant to the Bank include: 
 
 
• | assigning exposures secured by single-family residential properties to either a 50% risk weight for first-lien mortgages that meet prudent underwriting standards or a 100% risk weight category for all other mortgages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (increased from 0% under the previous risk-based capital rules);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
17


 
• | assigning a 150% risk weight to all exposures that are nonaccrual or 90 days or more past due (increased from 100% under the previous risk-based capital rules), except for those secured by single-family residential properties, which will be assigned a 100% risk weight, consistent with the Basel I risk-based capital rules;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility CRE acquisition, development and construction loans; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | applying a 250% risk weight to the portion of mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks that are not deducted from CET1 capital (increased from 100% under the previous Basel I risk-based capital rules).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s capital ratios exceeded the minimum capital adequacy guideline percentage requirements of the federal banking agencies for “well capitalized” institutions under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis. 
 Enforcement Powers of Federal and State Banking Agencies
 The federal bank regulatory agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver for financial institutions. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us and our officers and directors to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. In addition to the grounds discussed above under “—Prompt Corrective Actions,” the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a depository institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the fact that the depository institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan. The DBO also has broad enforcement powers over us, including the power to impose orders, remove officers and directors, impose fines and appoint supervisors and conservators.
The Company
 General. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and supervision by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the BHCA. Under the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of the its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. In accordance with Federal Reserve policy, and as now codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is legally obligated to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where the Company might not otherwise do so.
 The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 1280 of the California Financial Code. Consequently, the Company is subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the DBO.
 Acquisitions, Activities and Change in Control. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval by the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any bank holding company’s acquisition of more than 5% of a class of voting securities of any additional bank or bank holding company or to acquire all or substantially all, the assets of any additional bank or bank holding company. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, Federal Reserve considers, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (“CRA”), the applicant’s compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities. In addition, failure to implement or maintain adequate compliance programs could cause bank regulators not to approve an acquisition where regulatory approval is required or to prohibit an acquisition even if approval is not required.
 18


Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA and the Dodd-Frank Act), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state depository institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to complete interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
 Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring “control” of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. “Control” is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 5% and 24.99% ownership.
 Under the California Financial Code, any proposed acquisition of “control” of the Bank by any person (including a company) must be approved by the Commissioner of the DBO. The California Financial Code defines “control” as the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the Bank’s management or policies or to vote 25% or more of any class of the Bank’s outstanding voting securities. Additionally, a rebuttable presumption of control arises when any person (including a company) seeks to acquire, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of any class of the Bank’s outstanding voting securities.
 Permitted Activities. The BHCA generally prohibits the Company from controlling or engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be “so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.” This authority would permit the Company to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage. The BHCA generally does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuing such activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
 Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. The Company has not elected to be a financial holding company, and we have not engaged in any activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature.
 If the Company should elect to become a financial holding company, in order to maintain the Company’s status as a financial holding company, the Company and the Bank must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and have a least a satisfactory CRA, rating. If the Company were to become a financial holding company and the Federal Reserve subsequently determined that the Company, as a financial holding company, is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the Company would have a period of time during which to achieve compliance, but during the period of noncompliance, the Federal Reserve may place any limitations on the Company it believes to be appropriate. Furthermore, if the Company became a financial holding company and the Federal Reserve subsequently determined that the Bank, as a financial holding company subsidiary, has not received a satisfactory CRA rating, the Company would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities.

Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies are required to maintain capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy requirements, as affected by the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
 Source of Strength Doctrine. Federal Reserve policy historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide it. The Company must stand ready to use its available resources to provide adequate capital to the subsidiary bank during periods of financial stress or adversity. The Company must also maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting the Bank. The Company’s failure to meet its source of strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve’s regulations or both. The source of strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies where a bank holding company’s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels. In such a situation, the subsidiary bank will be required by the bank’s federal regulator to take “prompt corrective action.” Any capital loans by a bank holding company to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such bank. The BHCA provides that in the event of the bank holding company’s bankruptcy any commitment by a bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
 Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in activities that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or that constitute violation of law or regulations. Under certain conditions the Federal Reserve may conclude that certain actions of a bank holding company such as a payment of a cash dividend, would constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve also has the authority to regulate the debt of bank holding companies, including the authority to impose interest rate ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt. Under certain circumstances the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to file written notice and obtain its approval prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities, unless certain conditions are met.
 Tie in Arrangements. Federal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit. For example, the Bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that (i) the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to the Bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust services, (ii) the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or service from or to the Company or the Bank, or (iii) the customer must not obtain some other credit, property or services from competitors, except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended.
 Dividend Payments, Stock Redemptions and Repurchases. The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is affected by both general corporate law considerations and the policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. It is the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve’s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Additionally, in consideration of the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. The Federal Reserve possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel Capital III Rules, institutions that seek to pay dividends must maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% in CET1, which is to be phased in over a three year period that began on January 1, 2016. See “—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
 20


Bank holding companies must consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming any equity or other capital instrument included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to stated maturity, if such redemption could have a material effect on the level or composition of the organization’s capital base. Bank holding companies experiencing financial weaknesses, or that are at significant risk of developing financial weaknesses, must consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or other regulatory capital instruments.
 As a California corporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of California law, which allows a corporation to distribute cash or property to shareholders, including a dividend or repurchase or redemption of shares, if the corporation meets either a retained earnings test or a “balance sheet” test. Under the retained earnings test, the Company may make a distribution from retained earnings to the extent that its retained earnings exceed the sum of (a) the amount of the distribution plus (b) the amount, if any, of dividends in arrears on shares with preferential dividend rights. The Company may also make a distribution if, immediately after the distribution, the value of its assets equals or exceeds the sum of (a) its total liabilities plus (b) the liquidation preference of any shares which have a preference upon dissolution over the rights of shareholders receiving the distribution. Indebtedness is not considered a liability if the terms of such indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest thereon are to be made only if, and to the extent that, a distribution to shareholders could be made under the balance sheet test. In addition, the Company may not make distributions if it is, or as a result of the distribution would be, likely to be unable to meet its liabilities (except those whose payment is otherwise adequately provided for) as they mature. A California corporation may specify in its articles of incorporation that distributions under the retained earnings test or balance sheet test can be made without regard to the preferential rights amount. The Company’s articles of incorporation do not address distributions under either the retained earnings test or the balance sheet test.
 The Bank
 General. The Bank is a California-chartered bank. The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a California-chartered non-member bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision and regulation by the DBO, the chartering authority for California banks, and by the FDIC.
 Depositor Preference. In the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors including the parent bank holding company with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
 Brokered Deposit Restrictions. Well capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while adequately capitalized institutions are able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the yield paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was eligible to accept brokered deposits without a waiver from FDIC.
 Loans to One Borrower. With certain limited exceptions, the maximum amount that a California bank may lend to any borrower at any one time (including the obligations to the bank of certain related entities of the borrower) may not exceed 25% (and unsecured loans may not exceed 15%) of the bank’s shareholders’ equity, allowance for loan loss, and any capital notes and debentures of the bank.
 Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured depository institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. An institution’s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. For deposit insurance assessment purposes, an insured depository institution is placed in one of four risk categories each quarter. An institution’s assessment is determined by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base. The total base assessment rates range from 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points. While in the past an insured depository institution’s assessment base was determined by its deposit base, amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act revised the assessment base so that it is calculated using average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.
 21


Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The FDIC has until September 3, 2020 to meet the 1.35% reserve ratio target. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, may increase or decrease the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. As a result, the Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance premiums could increase. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank paid $245,000 in aggregate FDIC deposit insurance premiums.
 FICO Assessments. In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, insured depository institutions must pay Financing Corporation, or FICO, assessments. FICO is a mixed-ownership governmental corporation chartered by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board to recapitalize of the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO issued 30-year noncallable bonds of approximately $8.1 billion that mature in 2017 through 2019. Since 1996, federal legislation requires that all FDIC-insured depository institutions pay assessments to cover interest payments on FICO’s outstanding obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank paid $25,000 in aggregate FICO assessments.
 Supervisory Assessments. California-chartered banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the DBO to fund its operations. The amount of the assessment paid by a California bank to the DBO is calculated on the basis of the institution’s total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries, as reported to the DBO. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the DBO totaling $100,000.
 Capital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see “—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
 Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Bank. Under the California Financial Code, the Bank is permitted to pay a dividend in the following circumstances: (i) without the consent of either the DBO or the Bank’s shareholders, in an amount not exceeding the lesser of (a) the retained earnings of the Bank; or (b) the net income of the Bank for its last three fiscal years, less the amount of any distributions made during the prior period; (ii) with the prior approval of the DBO, in an amount not exceeding the greatest of: (a) the retained earnings of the Bank; (b) the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year; or (c) the net income for the Bank for its current fiscal year; and (iii) with the prior approval of the DBO and the Bank’s shareholders (i.e., the Company) in connection with a reduction of its contributed capital.
 The payment of dividends by any financial institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, in order to pay a dividend, the Basel III Capitals Rules’ capital conservation buffer generally requires that an institution maintains 2.5% in CET1, which is to be phased in over a three-year period that began on January 1, 2016. See “—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. As described above, the Bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable regulatory guidelines as of December 31, 2018.
 Transactions with Affiliates. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between the Bank and its “affiliates.” The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
 Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Shareholders. The authority of the Bank to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, including their immediate family members and corporations and other entities that they control, is subject to substantial restrictions and requirements under the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O, as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These statutes and regulations impose limits the amount of loans the Bank may make to directors and other insiders and require that: (i) the loans must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Company or the Bank; (ii) the Bank must follow credit underwriting procedures at least as stringent as those applicable to comparable transactions with persons who are not affiliated with the Company or the Bank; and (iii) the loans must not involve a greater than normal risk of non-payment or include other features not favorable to the Bank. Furthermore, the Bank must periodically report all loans made to directors and other insiders to the bank regulators.
 22


Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines establishing operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings. In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, the financial institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If a financial institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the financial institution’s rate of growth, require the financial institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments. 
 During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the financial institutions they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk management and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that financial institutions are expected to address in the current environment. The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.
 Branching Authority. California law permits California banks, such as the Bank, to establish an additional banking office with notice to the DBO. Deposit-taking banking offices must be also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate power. The Dodd-Frank Act permits insured state banks to engage in interstate branching if the laws of the state where the new banking office is to be established would permit the establishment of the banking office if it were chartered by a bank in such state. Finally, we may also establish banking offices in other states by merging with banks or by purchasing banking offices of other banks in other states, subject to certain restrictions.
 Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA is intended to encourage insured depository institutions, while operating safely and soundly, to help meet the credit needs of their communities. The CRA specifically directs the federal bank regulatory agencies, in examining insured depository institutions, to assess their record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The CRA further requires the agencies to take a financial institution’s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, consummating mergers or acquisitions or holding company formations.
 The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which measure a bank’s compliance with its CRA obligations on a performance based evaluation system. This system bases CRA ratings on an institution’s actual lending service and investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments, documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements. The ratings range from “outstanding” to a low of “substantial noncompliance.” The Bank had a CRA rating of “satisfactory” as of its most recent regulatory examination.
 23


Anti-Money Laundering and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the Patriot Act, is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act, substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
 Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. Financial Institutions are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of and transactions with such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence.
 Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate anti-money laundering and OFAC programs, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution.
 Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when financial institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. Concentration stemming from commercial real estate is one area of regulatory concern. The CRE Concentration Guidance provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Concentration Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. Based on the Bank’s loan portfolio, the Bank does not exceed these guidelines as of December 31, 2018.
Consumer Financial Services
 We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, and these laws’ respective state law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict our ability to raise interest rates and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other 
 24


remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
 Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those listed above. These federal, state and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by state and local attorneys general and civil or criminal liability.
 The structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
 The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer protection laws and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The review of products and practices to prevent such acts and practices is a continuing focus of the CFPB, and of banking regulators more broadly. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFPB with broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief or monetary penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, will continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.
 Mortgage and Mortgage-Related Products. Because abuses in connection with home mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act address mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including banks and savings associations, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower’s ability to repay, while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain “qualified mortgages.” The Dodd-Frank Act generally required lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans that the lender sells, and other asset-backed securities that the securitizer issues, if the loans do not comply with the ability-to-repay standards described below. The risk retention requirement generally is 5%, but could be increased or decreased by regulation. The Bank does not currently expect the CFPB’s rules to have a significant impact on its operations, except for higher compliance costs.
 Ability-to-Repay Requirement and Qualified Mortgage Rule. On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act’s ability-to-repay requirements. Under the final rule, lenders, in assessing a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage-related obligation, must consider eight underwriting factors: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) monthly payment on the subject transaction; (iv) monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) monthly payment for all mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. The final rule also includes guidance regarding the application of and methodology for evaluating, these factors.
 25


Further, the final rule clarified that qualified mortgages do not include “no-doc” loans and loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, terms in excess of 30 years, or points and fees paid by the borrower that exceed 3% of the loan amount, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, for qualified mortgages, the rule mandated that the monthly payment be calculated on the highest payment that will occur in the first five years of the loan, and required that the borrower’s total debt-to-income ratio generally may not be more than 43%. The final rule also provided that certain mortgages that satisfy the general product feature requirements for qualified mortgages and that also satisfy the underwriting requirements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (while they operate under federal conservatorship or receivership), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture or the Rural Housing Service are also considered to be qualified mortgages. This second category of qualified mortgages will phase out as the aforementioned federal agencies issue their own rules regarding qualified mortgages, the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ends, and, in any event, after seven years.
 As set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, subprime (or higher-priced) mortgage loans are subject to the ability-to-repay requirement, and the final rule provided for a rebuttable presumption of lender compliance for those loans. The final rule also applied the ability-to-repay requirement to prime loans, while also providing a conclusive presumption of compliance (i.e., a safe harbor) for prime loans that are also qualified mortgages. Additionally, the final rule generally prohibits prepayment penalties (subject to certain exceptions) and sets forth a 3-year record retention period with respect to documenting and demonstrating the ability-to-repay requirement and other provisions.
 Mortgage Loan Originator Compensation. As a part of the overhaul of mortgage origination practices, mortgage loan originators’ compensation has been limited such that they may no longer receive compensation based on a mortgage transaction’s terms or conditions other than the amount of credit extended under the mortgage loan. Further, the total points and fees that a bank and/or a broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans has been limited to 3.0% of the total loan amount. Mortgage loan originators may receive compensation from a consumer or from a lender, but not both. These rules contain requirements designed to prohibit mortgage loan originators from “steering” consumers to loans that provide mortgage loan originators with greater compensation. In addition, the rules contain other requirements concerning recordkeeping.
 Home Mortgage Servicing. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has implemented certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to mortgage servicing through rulemaking. The servicing rules require servicers to meet certain benchmarks for loan servicing and customer service in general. Servicers must provide periodic billing statements and certain required notices and acknowledgments, promptly credit borrowers’ accounts for payments received and promptly investigate complaints by borrowers. Servicers also are required to take additional steps before purchasing insurance to protect the lender’s interest in the property. The servicing rules call for additional notice, review and timing requirements with respect to delinquent borrowers, including early intervention, ongoing access to servicer personnel and specific loss mitigation and foreclosure procedures. The rules provide for an exemption from most of these requirements for “small servicers”, which are defined as loan servicers that service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans and service only mortgage loans that they or an affiliate originated or own.
Incentive Compensation Guidance 
 The federal bank regulatory agencies have issued comprehensive guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control and governance processes. The incentive compensation guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (i) balanced risk-taking incentives; (ii) compatibility with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or take other actions. In addition, under the incentive compensation guidance, a banking organization’s federal supervisor may initiate enforcement action if the organization’s incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. Further, the Basel III Capital Rules limit discretionary bonus payments to bank executives if the institution’s regulatory capital ratios fail to exceed certain thresholds starting January 1, 2016. The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators’ policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. 
 26


Financial Privacy
 The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. In addition, consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service, such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services.
Impact of Monetary Policy
 The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.
