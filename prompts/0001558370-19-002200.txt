 Item 1.  Business.
 Overview
 Rockwell Medical, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, (collectively, “we”, “our”, “us” or the “Company”) is a specialty pharmaceutical company targeting end-stage renal disease (“ESRD”) and chronic kidney disease with innovative therapies and products for the treatment of iron deficiency and hemodialysis (also referred to as “dialysis”).  These products support disease management initiatives to improve the quality of life and care of dialysis patients and are designed to deliver safe and effective therapy, while decreasing drug administration costs and improving patient convenience and outcomes. Our business strategy is to bring our pharmaceutical products to market ourselves in the United States and to utilize partners to develop and commercialize such products in international markets. 

Triferic® (ferric pyrophosphate citrate) is the Company’s proprietary iron therapy that replaces iron and maintains hemoglobin in dialysis patients without increasing iron stores. The Company has developed two presentations of Triferic that are added to the dialysate, or Dialysate Triferic, as the first and only FDA approved products indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin concentration in adult hemodialysis patients. A liquid, single-patient presentation of Dialysate Triferic was approved by the FDA in 2015, and a powder packet, multiple-use formulation of Dialysate Triferic was approved in 2016. We are currently building a commercial organization for Triferic and expect to launch Dialysate Triferic in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2019.  We have also developed an intravenous formulation of Triferic, or I.V. Triferic, a novel formulation of Triferic that would be used for the same indication, if approved. We expect to submit a new drug application (“NDA”) for I.V. Triferic during the second quarter of 2019, with a potential FDA approval during the first half of 2020. We plan to leverage the commercial capabilities we are establishing in 2019 to support the potential launch of I.V. Triferic in 2020.
 We are also an established manufacturer and leader in delivering high-quality hemodialysis concentrates and dialysates to dialysis providers and distributors in the United States and abroad. We manufacture, sell and distribute hemodialysis concentrates and other medical products and supplies used in the treatment of patients with ESRD. As one of the two major suppliers in the United States, our dialysis concentrate products are used to maintain human life by removing toxins and replacing critical nutrients in the dialysis patient’s bloodstream.  In 2018, we supplied approximately 25% of the United States domestic market with dialysis concentrates, with the majority of our sales in the United States.  We also supply dialysis concentrates to distributors serving a number of foreign countries, primarily in the Americas and the Pacific Rim. To date, substantially all of our sales have been concentrate products and related ancillary items.
 We are regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, as well as by other federal, state and local agencies. We hold several FDA product approvals including both drugs and medical devices.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximate balances of $22.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $10.8 million of investments available-for-sale, working capital of $33.6 million and an accumulated deficit of $272.4 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $20.4 million. We will require significant additional capital to sustain our operations and make the investments needed to execute our longer-term business plan. Our existing liquidity is not sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures within one year of the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We intend to raise additional capital for our business through additional equity or debt financing and through international partnership activities for Triferic; however, there are currently no commitments in place for further financing nor is there any assurance that such financing will be available to the Company on favorable terms, if at all.
 Our recurring operating losses, net operating cash flow deficits, and an accumulated deficit, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have not made any adjustments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

 We were incorporated in the state of Michigan in 1996.  
  Our Market Opportunity – Hemodialysis
 Hemodialysis is the primary treatment modality for ESRD employed in the United States with approximately 90% of all dialysis patients receiving in-center hemodialysis. We do not currently compete in the peritoneal or home dialysis segments. Hemodialysis treatments are primarily performed in freestanding clinics, as well as in some hospitals. The majority of dialysis services are performed by national and regional for-profit dialysis chains. Based on data published by the United States Renal Data Systems (“USRDS”) we estimate that there are more than 7,000 Medicare-certified treatment clinics in the United States. The two largest national for-profit dialysis chains service approximately 73% of the domestic in-center hemodialysis market. According to the most recent statistics published by USRDS, there were approximately 511,000 dialysis patients in the United States as of the end of 2016, of which approximately 458,000 were receiving in-center hemodialysis.
 Based on a global market study published by a major dialysis products manufacturer, the global ESRD population receiving some form of treatment was estimated to be over 3.2 million patients at the end of 2017 with the overall global patient population growing approximately 6% annually. Data from USRDS and the European Renal Association indicates that there are more than two million patients undergoing hemodialysis globally. According to the National Kidney Foundation, 10% of the worldwide population is affected by chronic kidney disease and millions die each year because they do not have access to affordable treatments. We have observed that the ESRD patient population in the United States has grown steadily over the past several decades and we expect the United States dialysis population to grow approximately 3% annually over the next several years. The Asia-Pacific market is projected to experience rapid growth in both the incidence of kidney disease and total treatment in the ESRD population over the next decade. One common side-effect of dialysis treatments is iron deficiency anemia. 
 The great majority of hemodialysis patients receive dialysis treatment three times per week, or approximately 150 times per year. Most patients have their dialysis treatment performed at a free-standing clinic for permanent loss of kidney function; these are called “chronic” patients. Some have their treatment performed at hospitals for temporary loss of kidney function; these are called “acute” patients. A small percentage of chronic patients receives their treatment at home; these are called “home” patients. In each setting, a dialysis machine dilutes concentrated solution, such as Rockwell’s concentrate products, with purified water. The resulting solution is called dialysate. Dialysate is pumped through an artificial kidney or filter (called a dialyzer) while the patient’s blood is pumped through a semi-permeable membrane inside the dialyzer in the opposite direction the dialysate is flowing. The dialysate can exchange bicarbonate, sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium into the patient’s blood while removing fluid and waste. Dialysate generally contains dextrose, sodium chloride, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium bicarbonate and citric acid or acetic acid. The patient’s physician chooses the proper concentrations required for each patient based on each particular patient’s needs.
 In addition to using concentrate products during every treatment, a dialysis provider also uses other products such as blood tubing, fistula needles, dialyzers, drugs, specialized component kits, dressings, cleaning agents, filtration salts and other supplies, some of which we sell. 
 Triferic (Ferric Pyrophosphate Citrate)
 Each hemodialysis treatment results in a small amount of blood loss due to trapping of red blood cells in the extracorporeal blood circuit and blood loss from vascular access.  This blood loss, when combined with repeated blood draws, increased blood losses from the gastrointestinal (“GI”) tract and stimulation of erythropoiesis by use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (“ESAs”), frequently results in iron deficiency and anemia in hemodialysis patients. In total, hemodialysis-related and GI iron losses amount to about 1 g - 1.5 g of elemental iron annually, not taking into consideration accidental blood losses from dialyzer clotting or bleeding from surgical procedures related to vascular access.
     Triferic is the first and only FDA-approved iron replacement product indicated for the replacement of iron to maintain hemoglobin in adult patients with hemodialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (HDD-CKD). We believe Triferic addresses an important unmet need in the treatment of ongoing iron losses and anemia in ESRD patients. Triferic’s unique mode-of-action distinguishes it from conventional I.V. iron products because Triferic donates iron to transferrin, immediately, and completely, as soon as it enters the blood. The iron bound to transferrin is transported to the bone marrow to make hemoglobin.  Triferic delivers approximately 5 – 7 mg of iron with every hemodialysis 

 
  5

 
treatment to the bone marrow and maintains hemoglobin without increasing iron stores (ferritin). In addition to the unique mechanism of action of Triferic, our first formulation of the drug is delivered via the dialysate, which is an innovative mode of delivery that we believe adds a convenience factor for the dialysis units.
     We developed Dialysate Triferic as the first and only FDA-approved product indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin concentration in adult hemodialysis patients, and we are in the process of developing and seeking FDA approval for I.V. Triferic, a novel intravenous formulation of Triferic that would be used for the same indication, if approved. A description of Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic is set forth below.
 Dialysate Triferic
 Dialysate Triferic received FDA approval in January 2015 and remains the only FDA-approved therapy indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in adult hemodialysis patients. 
 In 2013, we successfully completed two pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trials, called CRUISE-1 and CRUISE-2, for Dialysate Triferic. The CRUISE studies were identical single-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multi-center studies comparing Triferic delivered via hemodialysis bicarbonate concentrate to placebo group receiving standard hemodialysis solution, with approximately 600 subjects split evenly between the two studies and treatment arms. Oral or intravenous iron supplementation was prohibited, and ESA doses were held constant. Both CRUISE studies successfully met their primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to end-of-treatment. Triferic also met key secondary endpoints including maintenance of hemoglobin, maintenance of reticulocyte hemoglobin and increase in serum iron pre-to-post treatment without an increase in ferritin.
 A supportive clinical trial, called the PRIME study, demonstrated that Triferic delivered via the hemodialysis concentrate significantly reduced the need for ESA and IV iron during dialysis compared to the placebo arm dialyzed using conventional dialysate. The PRIME study was a nine-month, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center study in the United States that randomized patients equally to dialysate containing Triferic versus conventional dialysate. A total of 103 patients received the blinded study drug (52 Triferic and 51 Placebo). A blinded central anemia management group facilitated ESA dose adjustments, and intravenous iron was administered according to the approved indication and product labeling when ferritin levels fell below 200 µg/L. Both groups successfully kept their hemoglobin concentrations within the target range. At the end of treatment, there was a significant 35% reduction in prescribed ESA dose in patients treated with Triferic compared with the placebo patients. In a subgroup of ESA hypo-responsive patients—those on more than 13,000 units of epoetin per week—patients needed 74% less ESA in the Triferic group compared to the placebo group at the end of treatment. According to data from Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), a study of hemodialysis practices in the U.S., hypo-responsive patients, as defined in the PRIME study, represent more than 20% of the dialysis population. Finally, patients treated with Triferic in this study used 51% less intravenous iron than the placebo patients.
 In January 2014, we completed our long-term safety study for Triferic which was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter, multinational, Phase 3 study with an enrollment of 718 hemodialysis patients in the United States and Canada. This large-scale long-term safety study, coupled with the successful Phase 3 CRUISE studies, dosed over 100,000 Triferic administrations and demonstrated a safety profile similar to placebo patients.
 Dialysate Triferic received a reimbursement J-code on January 1, 2016 from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), providing that Dialysate Triferic would be reimbursed for administration to dialysis patients within the existing fixed-price “bundle” of payments that CMS provides to dialysis providers.  Because Dialysate Triferic reimbursement would be included in this bundled payment, we commenced efforts in early 2016 to seek so-called “add-on” or “separate” reimbursement for Dialysate Triferic, which is sometimes available for certain new, innovative therapies. Separate reimbursement, implemented by CMS through a program entitled Transitional Drug Add-on Payment Adjustment, or TDAPA, would allow dialysis clinics to more easily adopt Triferic because they would receive a payment over and above the bundled payment rate for Triferic, and would not need to consider the immediate financial impact of adopting the therapy. In the absence of separate reimbursement, adoption of Triferic could potentially be slowed due to the cost of conversion and the lack of an immediate financial incentive to adopt Triferic.
 In June 2018, our Board of Directors determined, based on feedback provided from CMS’s Innovation Center (“CMMI”), that Dialysate Triferic was unlikely to obtain add-on reimbursement in the near term. As a result, the Company 

 
  6

 
changed its commercialization strategy to plan for the commercial launch of Dialysate Triferic with reimbursement within the bundle of payments to dialysis providers, while continuing to develop I.V. Triferic (discussed below). We currently expect to commercially launch Dialysate Triferic in the second quarter of 2019. 
 I.V. Triferic
     We are also developing an intravenous formulation of Triferic, or I.V. Triferic, for use by hemodialysis patients in the United States as well as international markets. I.V. Triferic was developed pursuant to a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) with the FDA.  As part of the SPA, the FDA agreed that an equivalence approach would be acceptable for I.V. Triferic. In other words, rather than conducting additional safety and efficacy trials, our NDA would be acceptable if we are able to show equivalence between I.V. Triferic and Dialysate Triferic by comparing pharmacokinetic (“PK”) parameters of total iron and transferrin-bound iron of I.V. Triferic to Dialysate Triferic. The formal equivalence study was completed during 2018, and I.V. Triferic met bioequivalence criteria compared with Dialysate Triferic. Because I.V. Triferic is a new formulation and new method of administration, the FDA advised us that it requires a new 505(b)1 NDA.  We held a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in June 2018, during which the FDA agreed that the equivalence study was adequate for submission of an NDA. No other material issues were raised regarding our studies and a potential NDA filing. Based on the data from the equivalence study and feedback received during the pre-NDA meeting, we plan to submit our NDA to the FDA for approval during the second quarter of 2019, with an anticipated PDUFA date in the first half of 2020.
      On November 1, 2018, CMS issued interpretive guidance on the availability of Medicare reimbursement for certain products indicated to treat renal disease (the “CMS Guidance”). As set forth in the CMS Guidance, Dialysate Triferic would not be eligible for add-on reimbursement under the CMS Transitional Drug Add On Pricing Adjustment (“TDAPA”) program.  However, based on the CMS Guidance, we believe that, if approved by the FDA on or after January 1, 2020, I.V. Triferic may be eligible for separate sole source payment with a separate J-Code for a two-year timeframe. In accordance with the current guidance, separate TDAPA payments would last for two years following launch, after which I.V. Triferic would be priced inside the bundle. We are working with outside experts to optimize our NDA filing and PDUFA action dates to realize the potential benefits of separate payment, and we are targeting a launch of I.V. Triferic in the first half of 2020, subject to receipt of FDA approval. Upon submission of the NDA, we will be required to pay a user fee to the FDA of approximately $1.3 million.
     Limitations of Existing Therapies for Anemia in Hemodialysis Patients
     The current standard of care for treating anemia in HDD-CKD patients includes injectable erythropoietin stimulating agents (“ESAs”) and intravenous (“IV”) iron products. ESAs and IV iron products are often used together to address the two primary causes of anemia in dialysis patients: low erythropoietin (“EPO”) levels and iron deficiency.  EPO is a hormone that is produced by the kidneys and stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. In patients with CKD, the kidneys do not make enough EPO and as a result the bone marrow makes fewer red blood cells, causing anemia. ESAs are synthetic recombinant versions of human EPO that are administered to CKD patients to stimulate EPO production.  Administration of ESAs creates a significant demand for iron in the bone marrow, since iron is a critical building block for hemoglobin that is contained in red blood cells. CKD patients often have deficient serum iron levels, which can be caused by a number of factors including, but not limited to, blood lost during hemodialysis treatments and related lab testing, the limited diets of CKD patients, and iron sequestration that is caused by elevated levels of hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron metabolism. Since iron is a critical component of hemoglobin production, reduced levels of iron can cause iron deficiency anemia.  IV iron is used to support anemia management in dialysis patients to achieve or maintain an iron replete state prior to, during and following initiation of ESA therapy. IV iron products are macromolecular complexes which are taken up by macrophages where iron gets stored. Iron complexes are metabolized within the macrophages to release iron so that it can bind to transferrin in plasma - the iron carrier in the circulation. Transferrin carries the iron to the bone marrow for hemoglobin generation during red cell production. Due to the inflammation present in hemodialysis patients, hepcidin, the master molecule responsible for regulation of iron absorption from the GI tract and export of recycled iron from the macrophages is released, thereby blocking the release of iron from macrophages - referred to as iron sequestration.  This reduces the efficiency of iron delivery to the bone marrow for erythropoiesis, leading to a state of functional iron deficiency. Since IV iron finds a depot in macrophages it can be administered in large doses and is therefore ideally suited as a replacement therapy in iron depleted patients. Consistent with this mechanism of action, IV iron products were approved as large dose injection/infusion to replenish and restore iron stores in iron-depleted patients (serum ferritin level < 200 ng/mL) with iron deficiency anemia. However, since IV iron has been the only therapy available for hemodialysis patients for over 30 years it has been 

 
  7

 
commonly used off-label in hemodialysis patients in a proactive manner for maintaining iron balance and preventing the development of iron deficient state.   When iron-carbohydrate complexes are administered IV to hemodialysis patients, a significant portion of the iron is sequestered and the dose needed to deliver sufficient iron to the bone marrow far exceeds the amount of iron lost, hence causing progressive and cumulative tissue iron overload with concomitant elevation of serum ferritin levels. In summary, we believe that cumulative tissue iron overload caused by IV iron over time is potentially hazardous to patients. The long term safety of IV iron remains to be established. Furthermore, the carbohydrate moiety in IV iron complexes is thought to be responsible for anaphylactic reactions seen in all IV iron complexes although rarely. 
     Our Triferic Portfolio
     Triferic is structurally and functionally different from IV iron and is specifically FDA-approved to treat the small amounts of iron losses that all dialysis patients experience. Triferic is unique in molecular structure, mode-of-action (bypassing the hepcidin induced block to iron release from the macrophages) and the FDA-approved clinical indication (to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in adult hemodialysis patients).  All components of Triferic are physiologic and present in all mammals. Triferic is used proactively in hemodialysis patients to maintain iron homeostasis such that the amount delivered to the patient and to the bone marrow for erythropoiesis closely approximates the amount lost.  Consequently, tissue iron overload is avoided, unlike when iron-carbohydrate complexes are administered proactively. Triferic delivers iron and maintains hemoglobin without increasing iron stores (ferritin) and thus addresses an unmet need.  Finally, Triferic has demonstrated an excellent safety profile in clinical trials and in the Company’s sample demonstration program. No instances of anaphylaxis have been reported during > 600,000 doses administered and Triferic can be administered even to patients with history of allergic reactions to IV iron. Unlike IV iron, there are no contraindications to use of Triferic as per the FDA approved label.
 The First and Only FDA-Approved Therapy to Replace Iron and Maintain Hemoglobin.  As of now, Triferic is the only FDA-approved therapy indicated to replace iron and maintain hemoglobin in adult hemodialysis patients. We believe Triferic has the potential to capture significant market share due to its physiologic nature that facilitates clinical and cost-saving benefits.  Triferic is an innovative iron therapy that replaces the ongoing iron losses that routinely occur in the vast majority of hemodialysis patients.  Effective January 1, 2016, Triferic received a CMS reimbursement code, commonly referred to as a J-Code.
 Dialysate and Intravenous (I.V.) Formulations. We have two primary formulations of Triferic that we intend to commercialize. We expect to launch a formulation that is delivered through dialysate (Dialysate Triferic), including a liquid form and a power form, during the second quarter of 2019. We received FDA approval to market Dialysate Triferic in liquid form in 2015 and in powder form in 2016. We expect Dialysate Triferic will be reimbursed within the CMS bundled rate for dialysis providers. We have also developed an I.V. formulation of Triferic (I.V. Triferic), for which we expect to file an NDA during the second quarter of 2019. If approved, we believe the I.V. formulation could represent a significantly larger market opportunity in the United States for us given the potential for separate reimbursement pursuant to the CMS Guidance, as discussed in more detail below, and the fact that it provides for more flexible administration. Also, it can be delivered to patients who receive their treatment with dialysis machines using bicarbonate cartridges, which we believe is the predominant form of bicarbonate delivery in Europe and certain other non-US countries.  
 Separate Reimbursement.   As set forth in the CMS Guidance, we believe that, if approved by the FDA on or after January 1, 2020, I.V. Triferic may be eligible for separate sole source reimbursement with a separate J-Code. In accordance with the current guidance, separate TDAPA payments would last for two years following launch, after which I.V. Triferic would be priced inside the bundle. We believe that separate reimbursement for I.V. Triferic, if received, could result in more favorable pricing for I.V. Triferic.
 International Opportunities.  Our strategy for Triferic outside the United States is to license it to key partners for development and/or commercialization. To date, we have established partnerships in China, Canada, Peru and Chile. We are actively pursuing international licensing opportunities in a number of other countries and regions, with a focus on Europe, Japan and Latin America. Based on our discussions with market participants, we believe that many international markets disproportionately utilize dialysis machines that operate using dry bicarbonate cartridges or bags, whereas the significant majority of the U.S. market utilizes machines that operate using a liquid bicarbonate solution. As a result, we believe the international market opportunity for I.V. Triferic is greater than that of Dialysate Triferic due to the fact that Dialysate Triferic must be mixed with a liquid bicarbonate solution prior to administration. I.V. Triferic, on the other hand, can be infused regardless of the type of dialysis machines or hemodialysis solutions that are being 

 
  8

 
utilized. We have recently received regulatory approval for Dialysate Triferic in Peru, and we expect to receive regulatory approval for Dialysate Triferic in Chile in 2019. We also expect to file for regulatory approval for Dialysate Triferic in China and I.V. Triferic in Canada during 2019, pending completion of any required clinical trials and discussions with local regulators. Pursuant to our license agreement with Wanbang Biopharmaceutical, Co., Ltd. (“Wanbang”), in China, we, at our sole discretion, may provide notice to Wanbang of any new formulation, presentation or indications for Triferic, and following such notice Wanbang shall have the right, but not the obligation, to develop and commercialize such product(s). In February 2019, we notified Wanbang of our development of I.V. Triferic, and we are negotiating a new license agreement for I.V. Triferic in China.   
  Develop Additional Clinical Indications and Product Presentations of Triferic. We are exploring additional clinical indications related to iron deficiency that address unmet patient needs and we are evaluating opportunities to in-license other products that will complement our product portfolio.  We are also exploring other presentations of Triferic.
 Dialysis Concentrate Products
     We manufacture, sell, deliver and distribute hemodialysis concentrates, along with certain ancillary products. As one of the two major suppliers in the United States, our dialysis concentrate products, as more fully described below, are used to maintain human life by removing toxins and replacing critical nutrients in the dialysis patient’s bloodstream.  We use Baxter Healthcare Corporation (“Baxter”) as our exclusive marketer and distributor in the United States and in select foreign markets pursuant to an Exclusive Distribution Agreement, as amended (the “Distribution Agreement”).  In June 2017, we settled arbitration proceedings with Baxter related to the Distribution Agreement and entered into the First Amendment to Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Baxter. We also supply dialysis concentrates to distributors serving a number of foreign countries, primarily in the Americas and the Pacific Rim. Nipro Medical Corporation distributes our dialysis concentrates in certain countries in Latin America that are not covered under the Baxter Distribution Agreement.
     Dialysate concentrates accounted for approximately 96% of our 2018 revenue with ancillary products accounting for most of the remainder. Approximately 84% of our 2018 sales were to distributors and customers for use in the United States. All of our concentrate products are manufactured according to Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation guidelines and current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) established pursuant to Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 820 (“21 CFR 820”).   Our concentrate products are diluted with purified water on-site at the clinic in the dialysis machine, creating dialysate, which works to clean the patient’s blood.
     CitraPure Citric Acid Concentrate
     Our CitraPure Concentrate is citric acid-based, and 100% acetate-free, in contrast to the acetate-based products used for many years.  CitraPure does not promote inflammation associated with acetate-based products and the reduction in inflammation is beneficial to improving patient outcomes. Citrate acts as an anticoagulant and has been shown in clinical studies to reduce the need for heparin during dialysis treatment (CitraPure is not indicated for heparin sparing).  CitraPure is packaged as a liquid and as a dry powder acid concentrate for use with our Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer.  CitraPure is packaged as dry acid concentrate in 25 gallon cases and liquid acid concentrate in 55 gallon drums and four one gallon jugs to a case.     Dri-Sate Dry Acid Concentrate
     Our Dri-Sate Concentrate is our original acetic acid-based product.  Dri-Sate is packaged as a dry powder acid concentrate for use with our Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer.  Dri-Sate is packaged as dry acid concentrate in 25 gallon cases.     RenalPure Liquid Acid Concentrate
     Our RenalPure Liquid Concentrate is our original acetic acid-based product and is packaged in 55 gallon drums and four one gallon jugs to a case. 
     Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer
     Our Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer is designed for our CitraPure and Dri-Sate Dry Acid products and enables the clinic to mix acid concentrate on-site.  Clinics using Rockwell’s Dry Acid Concentrate products realize numerous 

 
  9

 
advantages, including lower cost per treatment, reduced storage space requirements, reduced number of deliveries and more flexibility in scheduling deliveries, while enabling the Company to reduce distribution and warehousing costs.
     RenalPure and SteriLyte Bicarbonate Concentrate
     RenalPure bicarbonate is a dry powder mixed on-site at the clinic and is packaged for bulk and individual treatment and SteriLyte bicarbonate is a liquid packaged in four one gallon jugs to a case and is used mainly in acute care settings.
     Ancillary Products
     We offer certain ancillary products to selected customers including cleaning agents, filtration salts and other supplies used by hemodialysis providers.
      Decision on Calcitriol (Active Vitamin D) Injection
     Calcitriol is an active Vitamin D injection for the management of hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.  Following a strategic review of this product, including pricing, commercial distribution and marketing, manufacturing efficiencies and capacity (including potential capital investment), we determined commercialization of Calcitriol in the U.S. would not be viable at this time. The decision was based, in part, on the fact that prevailing market prices for similar Vitamin D products are lower than our cost to produce Calcitriol on a dose-equivalent basis, and as a result it would be difficult for us to market Calcitriol profitably. As a result of this decision, we recorded an inventory reserve of $0.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting the remainder of our Calcitriol inventory. We are continuing to evaluate the potential commercialization of Calcitriol in China with our partner, Wanbang, including the market opportunity and regulatory pathway.     Our Growth Strategies
 U.S.  Commercialization of Triferic.  The United States hemodialysis market is currently the largest market in the world for dialysis products. There are an estimated 458,000 hemodialysis patients in the United States, or approximately 71 million treatments annually. 
 Dialysate Triferic. Following the CMS Guidance described earlier, we announced that we intend to commercialize Dialysate Triferic in the second quarter of 2019 “within the bundle”. We believe that an attractive market opportunity exists for Dialysate Triferic within the bundle. Accordingly, we are building a sales, marketing, and medical infrastructure to support the launch. We anticipate the launch will be supported by a combination of sales representatives, nurse educators and medical science liaisons. Our initial target customers will include selected medium and small sized dialysis chains and independent dialysis centers. We expect that the launch of Dialysate Triferic during 2019 will enable us to engage with key customers in the dialysis industry regarding the potential clinical and pharmacoeconomic benefits of Triferic and will provide us with valuable experience to support the potential launch of I.V. Triferic. 
 I.V. Triferic. We plan to submit an NDA for I.V. Triferic during the second quarter of 2019, with potential FDA approval in the first half of 2020. We expect to launch I.V. Triferic in the U.S. market in 2020, subject to FDA approval. We believe the market opportunity for I.V. Triferic in the U.S. is potentially larger than that of Dialysate Triferic due to the potential for separate reimbursement under TDAPA and more flexible administration. 
 Research to Support Triferic Value Proposition. To support the launch of Triferic in the U.S. and globally, we are evaluating potential clinical studies that we believe have the potential to support the value proposition for both Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic. Such studies, if successful, have the potential to provide valuable clinical and pharmacoeconomic data that can be used by our medical teams to educate dialysis providers of the benefits of Triferic. As an example, we have reached an agreement with EMA on a Phase 3 clinical study design for I.V. Triferic in the E.U. that would include a primary endpoint related to ESA dosing.  If successful, this trial will provide the data necessary to support a filing for regulatory approval in the E.U. and potentially provide additional data for our U.S. label. We also expect to initiate a clinical study in pediatric patients, as required under section 505B(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, during 2019. 
 International Commercialization of Triferic.   We are working to commercialize Triferic in various markets across the globe.  We are actively engaged in licensing negotiations for Triferic in a number of regions and countries. 

 
  10

 
We believe that I.V. Triferic will be the preferred method of delivery in a number of countries and will support our out-licensing efforts for those territories. We intend to leverage the development, regulatory, commercial presence and expertise of potential business partners to accelerate sales of our products throughout the world. To date, our international licensing agreements for Triferic have been focused on Dialysate Triferic due to the fact that Dialysate Triferic is approved in the U.S., thereby simplifying the approval process in certain international countries. We expect that our international licensing activities in the future will be more focused on I.V. Triferic given the larger market opportunity for the product in certain major markets, including Europe, Japan and China.
 In 2016, we licensed the commercialization rights for Dialysate Triferic for the Chinese market to Wanbang, a subsidiary of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (Fosun Pharma).  People’s Republic of China is expected to become the largest ESRD market in the world over the next several years. Commercial sales activity in this market will commence following regulatory or registration approval. We anticipate our Chinese partner will file for regulatory approval for Dialysate Triferic in 2019. In 2018 and early 2019, our partner commenced two clinical trials in China.  Under the terms of the Wanbang Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $4 million, which we are recognizing as revenue over the term of the agreement. Rockwell may also receive milestone payments of up to an additional $35 million over the life of the agreement in regulatory and revenue milestone payments, beginning with regulatory approval. We are also entitled to a transfer price on product sold to Wanbang that includes a double digit royalty, and Wanbang is responsible for the cost of the clinical trials and regulatory approval program in China. We retain manufacturing responsibilities for Triferic for China. Pursuant to the terms of our licensing agreement with Wanbang, we are negotiating a separate license agreement for I.V. Triferic with Wanbang, which license agreement will not include any additional development or sales milestones.
 We have also executed a distribution agreement to market Triferic in Canada with RMC Health Care Inc. We expect to file for regulatory approval of I.V. Triferic in 2019, and if approved we are entitled to receive a transfer price based on our partner’s sales price in Canada. Further, in 2017, we licensed the liquid formulation of Dialysate Triferic to Commercializadora Biorenal SpA in Chile and Quimica Europea in Peru. These distributors are responsible for obtaining regulatory approvals, and we are entitled to receive a fixed transfer price for sales of Dialysate Triferic in those markets. In January 2019, we received regulatory approval for Dialysate Triferic in Peru, representing the first approval of Triferic outside the United States, and we expect our partner to commercialize the product beginning in 2019. 
 Additional Potential Indications for Triferic.  We are currently evaluating development of other clinical indications for Triferic. These clinical applications include peritoneal dialysis (“PD”), total parenteral nutrition (“TPN”) and possibly treating cancer patients with functional iron deficiency. 
 Enhance Dialysis Concentrates Business: We are in the process of evaluating potential enhancements to our dialysis concentrates business in an effort to improve its profitability. Specifically, we are evaluating (i) price increases on selected products with certain customers, (ii) our ability to be more efficient in our manufacturing or transportation operations, and (iii) the expansion of our business to additional customers in the U.S. and other jurisdictions such as Latin America.
     Clinical Development 
     Triferic is approved for commercial sale in the United States and Peru, and is not approved for sale in other major markets globally.  We have received regulatory guidance from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) regarding the clinical studies that are needed to file for approval of I.V. Triferic in Europe.  At the present time, we do not intend to commence these clinical studies, absent finding a development partner in Europe or raising additional capital. In conjunction with our licensee in the People’s Republic of China, Wanbang Biopharmaceutical, two clinical pharmacology studies are ongoing, which we expect will be completed in 2019.
 As a post-approval requirement under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, we are required to conduct a further clinical study of the effectiveness of Dialysate Triferic in a pediatric patient population. We have reached agreement with the FDA on the design of this study, which we intend to commence in 2019, assuming we have the liquidity and capital resources to do so. The study design has also been agreed with the EMA under a Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).  The results of the pediatric study will support an EU marketing application if and when we are able to complete the other clinical trials that are required.
 Additionally, we believe that Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic have potential to be developed for use in other iron deficiency anemia indications, as well as other product presentations and other clinical applications, as described above.

 Distribution Agreement with Baxter 
     Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Baxter is our exclusive agent for commercializing our hemodialysis concentrate and ancillary products in the United States and various foreign countries for an initial term of 10 years ending October 2, 2024. We retain sales, marketing and distribution rights for our hemodialysis concentrate products for our international customers and in those countries in which we have an established commercial presence. During the term of the Distribution Agreement, Baxter has agreed not to manufacture or sell any competitive concentrate products in the United States hemodialysis market, other than specified products. The Distribution Agreement does not include any of the Company’s drug products. In June 2017, we entered into the First Amendment to Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Baxter (the “Amendment”. See “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.”).  The terms of the Amendment included, among other things, reduced pricing on certain accounts.  While reducing pricing, the Amendment provides incentive to Baxter to pursue new customers and increase future sales.
 Under the Distribution Agreement, Baxter purchases concentrate-related products from us at pre-determined gross margin-based prices per unit adjusted each year during the term and subject to an annual true up. The Distribution Agreement also requires Baxter to meet minimum annual purchase levels, subject to a cure period and certain other relief, in order to maintain its exclusive distribution rights. The minimum purchase levels increase each year over the term of the Distribution Agreement. Purchases in any calendar year that exceed the minimum may be carried forward and applied to future years’ minimum requirements. The Distribution Agreement also contains provisions governing the operating relationship between the parties, our obligations to maintain specified manufacturing capacity and quality levels, remedies, as well as representations, warranties and indemnification obligations of the parties. We continue to manage customer service, transportation and certain other functions for our current customers.   Baxter pays us an amount equal to our related costs plus a slight mark-up for these services.
 Upon the mutual determination of us and Baxter, the Distribution Agreement also provides that Baxter will pay us up to $10 million to build a new manufacturing facility in the Pacific time zone that will serve customers in the Western United States. The fee payable in connection with building the facility will be reduced to the extent that the facility is not operational within 12 months after the start of construction. Except for any leased components, we will own and operate the facility when completed.
 Either party may terminate the Distribution Agreement upon the insolvency or material breach of the other party or in the event of a force majeure. In addition, Baxter may also terminate the Distribution Agreement at any time upon 270 days’ prior written notice to us or if (i) prices increase beyond certain thresholds and notice is provided within 45 days after the true up payment is due for the year in which the price threshold is exceeded, (ii) a change of control of the Company occurs and 270 days’ notice is provided, or (iii) upon written notice that Baxter has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from selling in the United States any product covered by the Distribution Agreement due to a claim of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation relating to such product. If Baxter terminates the Distribution Agreement under the discretionary termination or the price increase provisions, it would be subject to a limited non-compete obligation in the United States with respect to certain products for a period of two years.
 Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we received an upfront fee of $20 million. If a “Refund Trigger Event” occurs, we would be obligated to repay a portion of the upfront fee and any paid portion of the facility fee. A “Refund Trigger Event” means any of the following: (i) a change of control of the Company involving any of certain specified companies; (ii) a termination by Baxter due to the Company’s bankruptcy or breach, or due to price increases that exceed the stated thresholds; (iii) a termination by either party due to a force majeure; (iv) settlement or adjudication of any claim, action or litigation relating to a covered product that materially and adversely affects Baxter’s commercialization of the product; and (v) any regulatory action or ruling relating to a covered product that materially and adversely affects Baxter’s commercialization of the product. In the event of a Refund Trigger Event occurring from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021, Baxter would be eligible for a 25% benefit of the Agreement’s Upfront Payment. In addition, if Baxter terminates the Distribution Agreement because Baxter has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from selling in the United States any product covered by the Distribution Agreement due to a claim of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation relating to such product prior to the end of 2019, Baxter would be eligible for a partial refund of $6.6 million. In no event would more than one refund be required to be paid.
 The Distribution Agreement may be extended an additional five years by Baxter if Baxter achieves a specified sales target and pays an extension fee of $7.5 million. If the first extension occurs, the Distribution Agreement term may later be extended an additional five years at Baxter’s option at no additional cost.

 Distribution and Delivery Operations
 The majority of our domestic dialysis concentrate products are delivered through our subsidiary, Rockwell Transportation, Inc., which operates a fleet of trucks used to deliver products to our customers.  Rockwell distribution and delivery will continue to operate under the Distribution Agreement on behalf of Baxter for domestic business.   We perform delivery services that are generally not available from common carriers or our competitors, such as stock rotation, non-loading-dock delivery and drum pump-off service.  As a result, we believe we offer a higher level of service than other providers.  We expect that our drug products will generally be delivered to our customers by our third-party logistics provider in the United States.     Sales and Marketing 
 The top ten dialysis providers treat approximately 417,000 hemodialysis patients in their centers according to an article published by Nephrology News in 2018.  We believe this constitutes approximately 86% of the hemodialysis patients in the United States as of 2018.  We intend to market and sell Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic directly to these customers and independent clinics in the United States. Our global strategy is to partner with and license these products to established companies in other regions of the world to assist in the further development (primarily clinical trials and regulatory activities), if necessary, and commercialize in those regions. We continue to pursue international licensing opportunities in a number of countries and specific regions.
     During the fourth quarter of 2018, we began to assemble a sales and marketing leadership team to support the commercialization of Triferic in the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, the team includes a Vice President of Sales and Strategic Accounts, who will be responsible for promoting Triferic to large and mid-sized dialysis chains, a Director of Sales, who will be responsible for managing a targeted sales team to promote Triferic to small and mid-sized dialysis chains and clinics. Additionally, our team includes a Vice President of Marketing, who has responsibility for managing the integrity of the Triferic brand worldwide. During 2019, we expect to expand our team to include (i) sales representatives who will promote Triferic to nephrologists and dialysis clinics; and (ii) nurse educators who will work closely with dialysis center nurses and technical staff to support the use of Triferic with appropriate dialysis patients. 
     We expect to market and educate through trade publications, journals, product literature, medical industry trade conferences and congresses, and other channels including digital, social and healthcare related mediums, and web-based applications.  We will target our commercial and medical education efforts to senior and operating management of dialysis companies, dialysis service providers, nephrologists, clinic administrators, nurses, medical directors and technical and purchasing personnel. 
     Our dialysis concentrate products are sold to customers in the United States through Baxter and DaVita in accordance with the Distribution Agreement. Our dialysis concentrate products are sold to international customers through independent sales agents, distributors and direct.
     Competition 
 Dialysis Concentrate Solutions and Dialysis Products Market Competition
 In the United States, the principal competitor for our concentrate products is Fresenius Medical Care NA (“Fresenius”), a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of dialysis devices, drugs and supplies and dialysis clinic operator, which has substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than us.  Fresenius, through its Fresenius Kidney Care division, operates approximately 2,500 clinics and treats approximately 37% of the in-center hemodialysis patients in the United States.  Fresenius also manufactures and sells a full range of renal products, including dialysis machines, dialyzers, concentrates and other supplies used in hemodialysis.  Fresenius also services clinics owned by others with its products where it commands a market leading position in its key product lines. Fresenius manufactures its concentrate in its own regional manufacturing facilities. Fresenius and Rockwell are the two major dialysis concentrate suppliers in the United States.     Iron Delivery Market Competition
     We expect to differentiate Triferic for iron maintenance therapy for hemodialysis patients based on its unique mode of action, clinical benefits, ability to lower treatment cost for providers, ease of administration and excellent safety

profile.  We are not aware of any other iron delivery products that compete with Triferic and its FDA-approved clinical indication.
     Historically, IV iron has been used to treat iron deficiency anemia, and currently, the drug Venofer® is generally regarded as having dominant market share over other IV iron drug products, such as Sanofi’s Ferrlecit®.  Venofer® is owned by Switzerland-based Galenica.  Galenica also markets Ferinject® which is primarily used to treat anemia in a non-dialysis setting. Fresenius has a sublicense agreement that allows Fresenius to distribute Venofer® to the dialysis market in the United States and Canada.  Other IV iron competitors include Watson‘s generic IV iron drug, Nulecit®.  IV iron is a repletion therapy and not an iron maintenance therapy, and therefore, technically, Triferic and IV iron are not competing products as their molecular structure, mode-of-action and FDA-approved clinical indication to treat anemia are different. Both therapies are needed to treat dialysis patients, where Triferic is administered during every dialysis treatment and IV iron is administered when there is excessive blood loss in a patient. Accordingly, as Triferic gains market share, we expect IV iron use will decline.
     We are also aware of a class of drugs, known as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylases (PH) inhibitors, or HIF-PH inhibitors, that are in development for a variety of indications, including the treatment of anemia for patients with chronic kidney disease. HIF-PHs are designed to stimulate erythropoiesis and manage iron utilization and can be administered orally. Certain HIF-PH compounds, including roxadustat and vadadustat, have reached Phase 3 development in the United States. If successfully developed and approved, HIF-PHs could potentially offer a more convenient, more effective and/or safer alternative to injectable ESAs for treatment of anemia in CKD patients while potentially increasing iron availability for hemoglobin synthesis. However, we believe iron replacement therapies, such as Triferic, will continue to be required to address ongoing iron losses in hemodialysis patients.
     The markets for drug products are highly competitive.  Competition in drug delivery systems is generally based on marketing strength, product performance characteristics (i.e., reliability, safety, patient convenience) and product price. Acceptance by dialysis providers and nephrologists is also critical to the success of a product.  The first product on the market in a particular therapeutic area typically is able to obtain and maintain a significant market share. In a highly competitive marketplace and with evolving technology, additional product introductions or developments by others could render our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, pharmaceutical and medical device companies are largely dependent upon health care providers being reimbursed by private insurers and government payers.  Drugs approved by the FDA might not receive reimbursement from private insurers or government payers. 
     Prior to 2011, CMS had paid providers for dialysis treatments under the Medicare program in two parts: the composite rate and separately reimbursed drugs and services.  The composite rate was a payment for the complete dialysis treatment except for physicians’ professional services, separately billed laboratory services and separately billed drugs.  CMS implemented a bundled reimbursement rate in 2011. The bundled rate is a single payment per treatment, thereby eliminating reimbursement for individual drugs and services to providers. Regulations provide that the rate is recalculated each year.  As a result, dialysis drugs are now viewed by providers as an additional cost rather than as a source of revenue.  We believe Triferic, due to its potential for improved therapeutic response and lower cost of administration, is an attractive therapy under this reimbursement landscape. 
     Quality Assurance and Control 
 Dialysis Concentrate Solutions Business
 We operate under FDA guidelines and place significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to our customers. Our quality management plays an essential role in meeting product quality requirements and FDA guidelines. We have implemented quality systems that involve control procedures that result in rigid conformance to specifications. Our quality systems also include assessments of suppliers of raw materials, packaging components and finished goods, and quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of products, assess the effectiveness of our quality systems and identify areas for improvement.
 Technically trained professionals at our production facilities maintain our quality system. To assure quality and consistency of our concentrates, we conduct specific analytical tests during the manufacturing process for each type of product that we manufacture. Prior to shipment, our quality control laboratory at each facility conducts analytical tests to verify that the chemical and microbial properties of the concentrates comply with the specifications required by industry standards. Each product is assigned a lot number for tracking purposes.

 Drug Manufacturing
 We utilize Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”)  to manufacture and package our drug products for sale. These contract manufacturers are FDA registered drug manufacturing establishments. We follow defined procedures to qualify manufacturers of our products and to review and approve all manufactured products to ensure compliance with FDA cGMP regulations. We have also developed a quality system for our drug products to ensure the products comply with required specifications prior to distribution. Government Regulation 
 The testing, manufacture and sale of our hemodialysis concentrates and the ancillary products we distribute are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FD&C Act”), and FDA regulations, the FDA regulates the pre‑clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical devices and drugs. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure of the government to grant pre‑market clearance or pre‑market approval for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
 We are developing and commercializing selected drug candidates, such as Triferic. The development and regulatory approval process for new drugs and additional indications for approved drugs includes preclinical testing and human clinical trials and is lengthy and uncertain. Before marketing any pharmaceutical or therapeutic product in the United States, the product must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FD&C Act.
 Moreover, the FDA imposes substantial requirements on new product research and the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products, including testing and clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of these products.
 Medical Device Approval and Regulation
 A medical device may be marketed in the United States only with prior authorization from the FDA, unless it is subject to a specific exemption. Devices classified as Class I devices (general controls) or Class II devices (general and special controls) are eligible to seek “510(k) clearance” from the FDA, as opposed to Class III devices, which require “premarket approval” (PMA) from the FDA as described in further detail below. 510(k) clearance generally is granted when the submitted information establishes that a proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in terms of safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval. A legally marketed device is a “pre‑amendment” device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (for which a PMA is not required), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class I or II, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA in recent years has been requiring a more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past, including requiring clinical trial data in some cases. For any devices that are cleared through the 510(k) process, modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or constitute a new or major change in the intended use of the device, will require new 510(k) submissions. It usually takes from three to six months from the date of submission to obtain 510(k) clearance, and may take substantially longer. Our hemodialysis concentrates (acid and bicarbonate) and other ancillary products are categorized as Class II devices.
 A device which sustains or supports life, prevents impairment of human health or presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury is categorized as a Class III device. A Class III device generally must receive approval through a PMA application, which requires proving the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA. The process of obtaining PMA approval is expensive and uncertain. It usually takes approximately one year to obtain approval after filing the request, and may take substantially longer.
 If human clinical trials of a device are required, whether for a 510(k) submission or a PMA application, and the device presents a “significant risk,” the sponsor of the trial (usually the manufacturer or the distributor of the device) will have to file an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application prior to commencing human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more appropriate Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”), the device may 

 
  15

 
be shipped for the purpose of conducting the investigations without compliance with all of the requirements of the FD&C Act and human clinical trials may begin. The FDA will specify the number of investigational sites and the number of patients that may be included in the investigation. If the device does not present a “significant risk” to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate IRBs without the need for FDA approval.
 Any devices manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA clearances or approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. As a manufacturer of medical devices for marketing in the United States, we are required to adhere to regulations, including 21 CFR 820, setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, which include testing, control and documentation requirements. We must also comply with medical device reporting regulations which require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or in which our products malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, it would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Under such a scenario, our products may be subject to voluntary recall by us or required recall by the FDA. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The FD&C Act prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses.
 We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other applicable quality system regulations. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.
 We have 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market hemodialysis concentrates in both liquid and powder form. In addition, we have received 510(k) clearance for our Dry Acid Concentrate Mixer.
 We must comply with the FD&C Act and related laws and regulations, including cGMP, to retain 510(k) clearances. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our 510(k) clearances from the FDA to manufacture and distribute our products. If we fail to maintain our 510(k) clearances, we may be required to cease manufacturing and/or distributing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of our FDA clearances are denied or rescinded, sales of our products in the United States would be prohibited during the period we do not have such clearances.
 Drug Approval and Regulation
 The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States, such as Triferic, requires the approval of the FDA. The FDA has established regulations, guidelines and safety standards which apply to the pre‑clinical evaluation, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of our new iron maintenance therapy product and other pharmaceutical products. The steps required before a pharmaceutical product can be produced and marketed for human use include: (i) pre‑clinical studies; (ii) submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence in the United States; (iii) adequate and well controlled human clinical trials; (iv) submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”); and (v) review and approval of the NDA by the FDA. An NDA generally is required for products with new active ingredients, new indications, new routes of administration, new dosage forms or new strengths. An NDA requires that complete clinical studies of a product’s safety and efficacy be submitted to the FDA, the cost of which is substantial. The costs are often less, however, for new delivery systems, which utilize already approved drugs than for drugs with new active ingredients.
 Pre‑clinical studies are conducted to obtain preliminary information on a pharmaceutical product’s efficacy and safety in animal or in vitro models. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before human clinical trials begin. Human clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA unless the FDA objects to the commencement of clinical trials.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing the product primarily for safety, metabolism and pharmacologic action in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers at one or more doses. In Phase 2 trials, the safety and efficacy of the product are evaluated in a patient population somewhat larger than the Phase 1 trials with the primary intent of determining the effective dose range. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at a large number of test sites. A clinical plan, or protocol, accompanied by documentation from the institutions participating 

 
  16

 
in the trials, must be received by the FDA prior to commencement of each of the clinical trials. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time.
 The results of product development and pre‑clinical and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA for approval. If an application is submitted, there can be no assurance that the FDA will review and approve the NDA in a timely manner. The FDA may refuse to file an NDA if it is not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.  The FDA may deny an NDA by way of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or it may require additional testing, including pre‑clinical, clinical and or product manufacturing tests. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately deny approval of the product. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, labeling, or a change in a manufacturing facility, an NDA supplement may be required to be submitted to the FDA. Product approvals may be withdrawn after the product reaches the market if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur regarding the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of products which have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of these products based on the results of these post‑marketing programs.
 Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections for compliance with regulations and each domestic drug manufacturing facility must be registered with the FDA. Foreign regulatory authorities may also have similar regulations. We expend significant time, money and effort in the area of quality assurance to fully comply with all applicable requirements. FDA approval to manufacture a drug is site specific. In the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug becomes inoperable, obtaining the required FDA approval to manufacture such drug at a different manufacturing site could result in production delays, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Manufacturers and distributors must comply with various post‑market requirements, including adverse event reporting, re‑evaluation of approval decisions and notices of changes in the product or in the process or procedures used to manufacture a product.
 Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to certain post-approval requirements. The FDA regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 Pediatric Requirements

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication where orphan designation has been granted.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical trials, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 Other Government Regulations
 The federal and state governments in the United States, as well as many foreign governments, from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation, we cannot predict what impact any reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on the pharmaceutical and medical device industry or on our business or operating 

 
  17

 
results. Our activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, and environmental protection and may be subject to other present and possible future local, state, federal and foreign regulations. We do not expect that compliance with these regulations, including environmental laws, will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
 The approval procedures for the marketing of our products in foreign countries vary from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We generally depend on our foreign distributors or marketing partners to obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals to market our products in those countries which typically do not require additional testing for products that have received FDA approval.
 However, since medical practice and governmental regulations differ across regions, further testing may be needed to support market introduction in some foreign countries. Some foreign regulatory agencies may require additional studies involving patients located in their countries. Even after foreign approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before products may be marketed. Issues related to import and export can delay product introduction. Many countries require additional governmental approval for price reimbursement under national health insurance systems.
 Product License Agreements 
 We are party to an in-license agreement for exclusive worldwide rights to certain patents and information related to our Triferic product.  On October 7, 2018, we entered into a Master Services and IP Agreement (the “Charak MSA”) with Charak, LLC and Dr. Ajay Gupta (collectively, “Charak”), who serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of the Company. Pursuant to the Charak MSA, the parties entered into three additional agreements described below related to the license of certain soluble ferric pyrophosphate (“SFP”) intellectual property owned by Charak, as well as the Employment Agreement (defined below). The Charak MSA provides for a payment of $1,000,000 to Dr. Gupta, payable in four quarterly installments of $250,000 each on October 15, 2018, January 15, 2019, April 15, 2019 and July 15, 2019, and reimbursement for certain legal fees incurred in connection with the Charak MSA. The first two installments due under the Charak MSA were paid when due.
         Pursuant to the Charak MSA, the aforementioned parties entered into an Amendment, dated as of October 7, 2018 (the “Charak Amendment”), to the Licensing Agreement between the Company and Charak, dated January 7, 2002, as amended (the “2002 Agreement”), under which Charak granted the Company an exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable license to commercialize SFP for the treatment of patients with renal failure. The Charak Amendment amends the royalty payments due to Charak under the 2002 Agreement such that the Company is liable to pay Charak royalties on net sales by the Company of products developed under the license, which includes the Company’s Triferic product, at a specified rate until December 31, 2021 and thereafter at a reduced rate from January 1, 2022 until February 1, 2034. Additionally, the Company shall pay Charak a percentage of any sublicense income during the term of the agreement, which amount shall not be less than a minimum specified percentage of net sales of the licensed products by the sublicensee in jurisdictions where there exists a valid claim, on a country-by-country basis, and no be less than a lower rate of the net sales of the licensed products by the sublicensee in jurisdictions where there exists no valid claim, on a country-by-country basis.
     Also pursuant to the Charak MSA, the Company and Charak entered into a Commercialization and Technology License Agreement I.V. Triferic, dated as of October 7, 2018 (the “IV Agreement”), under which Charak granted the Company an exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license to SFP for the purpose of commercializing certain intravenous-delivered products incorporating SFP for the treatment of iron disorders worldwide for a term that expires on the later of February 1, 2034 or upon the expiration or termination of a valid claim of a licensed patent.

 Suppliers 

The raw materials and packaging materials for our hemodialysis concentrates, the components for our hemodialysis kits and the ancillary hemodialysis products distributed by us are generally available from several potential suppliers. The raw materials for our concentrates products consist primarily of chemical ingredients and packaging components, all of which meet or exceed the requirements of United States Pharmacopeia (“USP”).  Key raw materials for our hemodialysis concentrates include citric acid USP, calcium chloride USP, dextrose USP, glacial acetic acid USP, magnesium chloride USP, potassium chloride USP, sodium bicarbonate hemodialysis grade USP and sodium chloride USP, as well as key packaging components such as bottles, caps, bags, boxes and labels. There are multiple potential suppliers for each of these raw materials. We generally negotiate pricing and approximate material quantities for our

chemicals on an annual basis and utilize blanket purchase orders with monthly release schedules to meet our needs for production. 
 We have engaged CMOs for the manufacture and packaging of Triferic. We have two suppliers for the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) utilized in Triferic, two packagers for the powder formulation of Dialysate Triferic and one fill and finish vendor for the liquid formulation of Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic. New production is generally initiated via purchase orders, though we will evaluate the need for supply agreements based on our forecasted product needs. The lead time to qualify and obtain regulatory approval for an additional CMO could be lengthy. The loss of any significant drug product supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    
 See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks related to our key suppliers.
 Customers 
 We operate in one market segment, the hemodialysis market, which involves the manufacture, sale and distribution of hemodialysis products to hemodialysis clinics, including pharmaceutical, dialysis concentrates, dialysis kits and other ancillary products used in the dialysis process. In October 2014, we entered into the Distribution Agreement with Baxter, which was amended in June 2017, pursuant to which Baxter received exclusive distribution rights for our concentrate products in the United States.  Our domestic customer contracts for the supply of dialysis concentrate products that permitted assignment to Baxter without consent have been assigned to Baxter.  As a result, for 2018 and 2017, our direct sales to Baxter aggregated approximately 26% and 27% of sales, respectively, and we had a receivable from Baxter of $2,824,051 and $1,863,412 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 One customer, DaVita Healthcare Partners, Inc. (“DaVita”), accounted for 46% of our sales in 2018 and 50% of our sales in 2017.  Our accounts receivable from this customer were $2,538,503 and $2,411,367 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Our contract with DaVita was recently extended and is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2019. While we are confident that we will be able to negotiate a new agreement with DaVita, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to reach such agreement on terms that are acceptable to us.   
 Another customer, Nipro Medical Corporation, accounted for 10% and 7% of our sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 DaVita, Baxter, the accounts administered by Baxter, and Nipro are important to our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The loss of any significant accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 No other customers accounted for more than 10% of our sales in any of the last three years. 
 See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks related to our key customers.
 The majority of our international sales in each of the last two years were sales to domestic distributors that were resold to end users outside the United States.  Our total international sales, including sales made through domestic distributors for resale outside the United States, aggregated 14% and 12%, of our overall sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 See Item 1A “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain risks related to our foreign sales.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 269 employees, substantially all of whom are full time employees. Our arrangements with our employees are not governed by any collective bargaining agreement. Our employees are employed on an “at‑will” basis. Research & Development 

 
  20

 

 We have invested heavily in the testing and development of Triferic.  We have engaged outside service providers, contract research organizations, consultants and legal counsel to assist us with clinical trials, product development and obtaining regulatory approval. We completed human clinical trials and other testing in 2013 and submitted our NDA for Triferic to the FDA in 2014. We received FDA approval for Triferic in January 2015.  
 Since approval of Triferic, we have conducted additional clinical studies of Triferic for other indications and presentations, including the IV formulation, a proof of concept clinical study in peritoneal dialysis patients, and a pediatric study of Triferic. We have incurred product development and research costs aggregating approximately $5,642,000 and $6,321,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively, with such costs primarily related to Triferic.  Such costs also include effort to address manufacturing issues in an effort to achieve FDA approval of Calcitriol (refer to “Decision on Calcitriol”).
  We expect research and product development spending in 2019 and 2020 will focus on the Triferic platform, with projects that may include the pediatric study to satisfy FDA and EMA requirements, a Phase 3 study in Europe to support registration for approval, and post-marketing studies to further demonstrate the pharmacoeconomics and patient outcomes of Triferic. Additional studies of Triferic in new indications, including peritoneal dialysis and total parenteral nutrition, are being considered.
