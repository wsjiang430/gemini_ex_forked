Item 1. Business
Introduction



We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a business company with limited liability (meaning that our shareholders have no liability, as members of our company, for the liabilities of our company over and above the amount already paid for their shares) and formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements with, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Report as our initial business combination.
Business Strategy



Our efforts in identifying prospective target businesses are not be limited to a particular industry or country, including but not limited to businesses that have their primary operations located in the Asia-pacific region (“Asia-pacific” or “Asia”). We believe that we will add value to these businesses primarily by providing them with access to the U.S. capital markets.



We seek to capitalize on the strength of our management team. Our team consists of experienced financial services and accounting professionals, senior operating executives, and managers of Asian and U.S. companies. Our independent directors have collective experience in entrepreneurship, asset management/advisory services, and accounting & tax practices in mainland China, Hong Kong and the U.S, as well as knowledge of sectors and industries arising in connection with provision of those services and entrepreneurial experiences. We believe we benefit from their accomplishments, and specifically their current activities in the Asian market, in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. However, the past performance of our management team, advisors and their affiliates is not a guarantee either of (i) success of any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will complete a business combination.



Our officers and directors, or our “management team,” has a broad range of collective operational experience across a variety of economic sectors, including corporate financing, debt financing, internet, real estate, biopharmaceuticals, consumer and retail, manufacturing, capital markets and information technology. Our acquisition strategy leverages our team’s relationships as well as relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which we should provide us with a number of potential target businesses with which we may consummate an initial business combination.



We deploy a pro-active, thematic sourcing strategy and focus on companies for which we believe the combination of our relationships, capital and capital markets expertise and operating experience of executives at Shanghai Ning Sheng Supply Chain Group Co. Ltd., or “Ning Sheng Group Co.”, our sponsor’s 100% parent company, can help accelerate the target business’ growth and performance.



Investment Criteria



Our management team focus on creating shareholder value by leveraging its experience in the management, operation and financing of businesses to improve the efficiency of operations while implementing strategies to scale revenue organically and/or through acquisitions. In addition to the factors listed above, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines, which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see justification to do so.

● | Middle-Market Growth Business. We primarily seek to acquire one or more growth businesses with a total enterprise value of between $200 million and $300 million. We believe that there are a substantial number of potential target businesses within this valuation range that can benefit from new capital for scalable operations to yield significant revenue and earnings growth. We currently do not intend to acquire either a start-up company (a company that has not yet established commercial operations) or a company with negative cash flow.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Companies with Opportunity to Strengthen Management and Add Value. We seek to acquire one or more businesses that provide a platform for the existing management team to leverage the experience of our management team. We believe that the operating expertise of our management team is well suited to complement and, if beneficial, replace the target’s management team.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






1








● | Companies in Business Segments that are Strategically Significant to the regional areas, including but not limited to the Asia-pacific region. We seek to acquire those businesses with strong technological know-how, distribution networks and/or business practices in economic sectors that are currently experiencing significant outbound investing in the Asia-pacific region. Such sectors include, but are not limited to, software, and hardware technology, clean energy, health care, consumer and retail, energy and resources, food processing, and education.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business with Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of both existing and new product development, increased production capacity, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Niche Leader and Specialized Business with Earning Growth Potential. We seek to acquire target companies that have significant underexploited expansion opportunities in a niche sector. One of the key elements of our sponsor’s typical value creation approach is to acquire target companies to accelerate their growth. We seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of brand and new product development, increased production capacity, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage. This can be accomplished through a combination of accelerating organic growth and finding attractive add-on acquisition targets. Our management team has significant experience in identifying such targets and helping target management assess the strategic and financial fit. Similarly, our management has the expertise to assess the likely synergies and a process to help a target integrate acquisitions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Long-term Revenue Visibility with a Defensible Market Position. We seek to acquire target companies that are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate by developing new products or services, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance and where an acquisition may help facilitate growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Companies with Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable and increasing free cash flow. We focus on one or more businesses that have predictable revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance shareholder value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We seek to acquire a business or businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and which can effectively utilize access to broader sources of capital and a public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our sponsor and management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us.



Significant Activities Since Inception



On June 26, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 4,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, no par value, one warrant to purchase one ordinary share and one right to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share upon the consummation of our initial business combination, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-237153). Each whole warrant is exercisable for one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $40,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses).





2







Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 240,000 units at a price of $10.00 per private unit issued to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $2,400,000.



$40,000,000 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders. 



Our units began trading on June 24, 2020 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BRLIU.” On June 29, 2020, EarlyBirdCapital notified us of their intention to exercise their over-allotment option in full. As such, on June 30, 2020, we consummated the sale of an additional 600,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, and the sale of an additional 21,000 private units, at $10.00 per private unit to our sponsor, generating total gross proceeds of $6,210,000. A total of $6,000,000 of the net proceeds was deposited into the trust account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the trust account to $46,000,000.



Commencing on July 22, 2020, the units, and their underlying ordinary shares, rights, and warrants began separate trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “BRLIU,” “BRLI,” “BRLIR,” and “BRLIW” respectively.



Pursuant to our second amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we had 12 months from the closing of our initial public offering (or up to 21 months upon extension of the period of time to consummate a business combination) to consummate our initial business combination. On June 22, 2021, our sponsor timely deposited $460,000 in our trust account, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, and the trust agreement we entered into with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, for us to extend our period of time to consummate our initial business combination by 3 months from June 23, 2021 until September 23, 2021.



On September 20, 2021, our sponsor timely deposited $460,000 in our trust account for us to extend our period of time to consummate our initial business combination by 3 months from September 23, 2021 until December 23, 2021. On December 20, 2021, our sponsor timely deposited $460,000 in our trust account for us to extend our period of time to consummate our initial business combination by 3 months from December 23, 2021 until March 23, 2022.



On February 22, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), with Nukkleus Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Nukkleus”). Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Nukkleus would become our Nasdaq-listed parent company. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, are hereinafter referred to as the “Business Combination.”



The Merger Agreement provides that, promptly following the signing of the Merger Agreement, Nukkleus shall form a British Virgin Islands company and wholly owned subsidiary of Nukkleus (“Merger Sub”), and cause Merger Sub to join the Merger Agreement by executing a joinder to the Merger Agreement and to assume all of the rights and obligations of Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement further provides that, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into us, and each ordinary share of Merger Sub will be converted into one share of the surviving corporation, and our issued and outstanding shares immediately prior to the effective time of the Business Combination will be converted into the right to receive the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement).



On March 18, 2022, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by a further four months, or until July 23, 2022. In connection with the extension, the Sponsor, deposited $634,594 into our trust account, representing $0.16 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension.  In connection with a special meeting to approve the extension of the business combination period, our shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate amount of 1,025,281 shares.



On July 13, 2022, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by a further three months, or until October 23, 2022. In connection with the extension the Sponsor deposited $353,000 into the Trust Account, representing $0.12 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension. In connection with a special meeting to approve the extension of the business combination period, our shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate amount of 1,025,281 shares.

On October 19, 2022, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by up to a further three months, or until not later than January 23, 2023. In connection with the three monthly extensions Nukkleus deposited $67,800 into the Trust Account ($22,600 per each monthly extension), representing $0.12 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension. In connection with a special meeting to approve the extension of the business combination period, our shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate amount of 2,375,991 shares.



On January 19, 2023, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by up to a further three months, or until not later than April 23, 2023. In connection with the monthly extension to February 23, 2023, Nukkleus deposited $21,350 into the Trust Account, representing $0.0525 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension, and on February 23, 2023, deposited $32,500.00 into the Trust Account, representing $0.08 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension, to extend to March 23, 2023. In connection with a special meeting to approve the extension of the business combination period, our shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate amount of 159,203 shares.



Effecting our initial business combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until the consummation of our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private units, our shares, new debt, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our ordinary shares, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.



Subject to the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management assesses these risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, this assessment may not result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or the rules of Nasdaq, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

Sources of target businesses



Target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our public filings and know what types of businesses we are targeting.



We may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction to firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions, and are engaged by us to refer such target companies to us. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction).



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. None of our officers and directors currently has any relevant pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that would conflict with our company’s objectives.



Our officers have agreed not to become involved with another publicly listed blank check company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, prior to us announcing an agreement to acquire our initial business combination, or the expiration of the period for us to announce and/or complete our initial business combination.



Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination



Subject to our management’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.





5







Fair market value of target business or businesses



So long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, the target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination to acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business, but we will only consummate such business combination if we will become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes) or are otherwise not required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even though we will own a majority interest in the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If we acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test.



The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or an independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. We are not be required to obtain such an opinion if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.



Lack of business diversification



For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:




● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Limited ability to evaluate the target’s management team



Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is also not certain whether one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will be contracted to remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.





6







Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Shareholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination



Although we may seek shareholder approval before we effect our initial business combination, we may not do so for business or legal reasons (so long as such transaction does not require shareholder approval under the Companies Act or the rules of Nasdaq). Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether we expect shareholder approval would be required under the Companies Act for each such transaction.




Type of Transaction | Whether Shareholder Approval is Required
---------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target with a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 
Entering into contractual agreements with a target to obtain control | No 




Additionally, under NASDAQ’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:




● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We also may be required to obtain shareholder approval if we wish to take certain actions in connection with our initial business combination such as adopting an incentive stock plan or amending our charter. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing of our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.



Redemption rights for public shareholders upon consummation of our initial business combination



We had until June 23, 2021 to consummate our initial business combination. However, because we anticipated that we would not be able to consummate our initial business combination by June 23, 2021, we, by resolution of our board as requested by our sponsor, extended the period of time to consummate a business combination three times, each by an additional three months until March 23, 2022. Additionally, on March 18, 2022, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by a further four months, or until July 23, 2022. On July 13, 2022, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by a further three months, or until October 23, 2022. On October 19, 2022, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by up to a further three months, or until not later than January 23, 2023. On January 19, 2023, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by up to a further three months, or until not later than April 23, 2023. Our sponsor has timely deposited a total of $2,489,244 into our trust account to extend the deadline for us to consummate our initial business combination from to March 23, 2023.



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account as of December 31, 2022 was $10.77 per public share. Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private units and any public shares, as applicable, they may hold in connection with the completion of our business combination.





7







Manner of Conducting Redemptions



We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares in connection with our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer.



We intend to hold a shareholder vote in connection with our business combination. In such case, we will:




● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------




We will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon consummation of the initial business combination.



In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem shall remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act.



In connection with the successful consummation of our business combination, we may redeem pursuant to a tender offer up to that number of ordinary shares that would permit us to maintain net tangible assets of $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. However, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our proposed initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or members of its management team, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the allocation of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares that are validly tendered plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not consummate the business combination, we will not purchase any shares pursuant to the tender offer and all shares will be returned to the holders thereof following the expiration of the tender offer. Additionally, since we are required to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination (which may be substantially higher depending on the terms of our potential business combination), the chance that the holders of our ordinary shares electing to redeem in connection with a redemption conducted pursuant to the proxy rules will cause us to fall below such minimum requirement is increased.



When we conduct a tender offer to redeem our public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the tender offer rules, the offer will be made to all of our shareholders, not just our public shareholders. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private shares and public shares in connection with any such tender offer.



We will consummate our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders as well as the representative shares have agreed to vote their founder shares, private shares, and representative shares, as well as any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination.



In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares and the related business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

Permitted purchases of our securities by our affiliates



In the event we seek shareholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.



In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.



The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.



In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.



Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.

Tendering share certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights



We will require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the expiration date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or in the event we distribute proxy materials, up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.



The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on our initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him to deliver his certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the consummation of the business combination during which he could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he could sell his shares in the open market before actually delivering his shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the consummation of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery at or prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.



Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in any tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.



Timeline to Complete Business Combination



We initially had until June 23, 2021 to consummate our initial business combination. However, we have extended the period of time to consummate a business combination four times, until July 23, 2022, after the sponsor deposited additional funds totaling $2,014,594 into the trust account. Initially, pursuant to the terms of our memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order for the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination to be extended, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, deposited into the trust account $460,000 ($0.10 per unit in either case) for each three month extension, and an aggregate of $1,380,000, or $0.30 per share, for the extension to March 23, 2022.

On March 18, 2022, our shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of our articles of association to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination from March 23, 2022 to July 23, 2022. In connection with the vote to amend and restate our articles of association, our shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 633,792 ordinary shares. Following such redemptions and the deposit of $634,594 as a contribution from our Sponsor, the amount of funds remaining in the trust account was approximately $41.5 million. Accordingly, following such redemptions and the deposit of the contribution, we have 5,477,208 ordinary shares issued and outstanding (1,511,000 of which are shares held by our initial shareholders and are not subject to redemption) and the pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account was approximately $10.46 per public share.



On July 13, 2022, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by a further three months, or until October 23, 2022. In connection with the extension the Sponsor deposited $353,000 into the Trust Account, representing $0.12 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension. In connection with a special meeting to approve the extension of the business combination period, our shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate amount of 1,025,281 shares. Following such redemptions and the deposit of the contribution described above, the amount of funds remaining in the trust account was approximately $31.2 million. Accordingly, following such redemptions and the deposit of the contribution, we had 4,451,927 ordinary shares issued and outstanding (1,511,000 of which are shares held by our initial shareholders and are not subject to redemption) and the pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account was approximately $10.60 per public share.



On October 19, 2022, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by up to a further three months, or until not later than January 23, 2023. In connection with the three monthly extensions Nukkleus deposited $67,800 into the Trust Account ($22,600 per each monthly extension), representing $0.12 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension. In connection with a special meeting to approve the extension of the business combination period, our shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate amount of 2,375,991 shares. Following such redemptions and the deposit of the contribution described above, the amount of funds remaining in the trust account was approximately $6.1 million. Accordingly, following such redemptions and the deposit of the contribution, the Company had 2,075,936 ordinary shares issued and outstanding (1,511,000 of which are shares held by our initial shareholders and are not subject to redemption) and the pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account is approximately $10.72 per public share.



On January 19, 2023, our shareholders approved an extension of the period of time we can consummate our initial business combination by up to a further three months, or until not later than April 23, 2023. In connection with the monthly extension to February 23, 2023, Nukkleus deposited $21,350 into the Trust Account, representing $0.0525 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension, and deposited $32,500.00 into the Trust Account, representing $0.08 per public ordinary share that was not redeemed in connection with the shareholder vote to approve the extension, to extend to March 23, 2023. In connection with a special meeting to approve the extension of the business combination period, our shareholders elected to redeem an aggregate amount of 159,203 shares. Following such redemptions and the deposit of the contribution described above, the amount of funds remaining in the trust account is approximately $4.4 million. Accordingly, following such redemptions and the deposit of the contribution of $0.0525 per outstanding ordinary share, the Company has 1,816,733 ordinary shares issued and outstanding (1,411,000 of which are shares held by our initial shareholders and are not subject to redemption) and the pro rata portion of the funds available in the trust account was approximately $10.77 per public share. Following an additional contribution of $0.08 per outstanding ordinary share in connection with the extension to March 23, 2023, the Company had funds available in the trust account equal to $4.4 million or $10.85 per public share.



Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we must complete our initial business combination by not later than April 23, 2023. We may not be able to consummate the planned Business Combination with Nukkleus, or find a suitable alternative target business and consummate our initial business combination within such time period. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination by that time, and our shareholders do not approve an amendment to our amended and restated articles of association to further extend the time period by which we may complete our initial business combination, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than five business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be effected as required by function of our memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.





11







Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands newspaper and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where the company has its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate to identify the company’s creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notificational filing with the Registrar. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.



Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and private units (including the rights and warrants thereunder), as applicable, if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period from the closing of our initial public offering, or where funds are otherwise to be redeemed from the trust account. However our initial shareholders, sponsor, directors, and advisors shall be eligible to receive their pro rata portion of any liquidating distributions by the Company for any shares purchased in the IPO or aftermarket.



We may also call the warrants for a redemption price of $0.01 per warrant at any time after the warrants become exercisable if notice of not less than 30 days is given and the last sale price of the ordinary shares has been at least $16.50 for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period commencing once the warrants become exercisable and ending the third day prior to the day on which notice is given. Furthermore, in the event of a call we may, at our discretion force the holders of those warrants to exercise the warrants on a cashless basis, as discussed in detail in this Report.



The holders of our rights or warrants will not have any redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless in the event that we do not consummate our initial business combination by not later than April 23, 2023, or decide to call the warrants for $0.01 per warrant, or force the exercise of those warrants as discussed in detail in this Report.



We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account or up to $50,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or she requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.



Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings of the company under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them.



If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately$10.46. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than these per share amounts.



Although we have sought and will continue to seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.





12







In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.85 per share (or up to $10.93 per share if the period by which we may consummate our initial business combination is extended as set forth above), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims.



However, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. Other than as described above, none of our other officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. We cannot however guarantee that all agreements will contain this waiver.



In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.85 per share (or up to $10.93 per share if the period by which we may consummate our initial business combination is extended as set forth above) and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.85 per share (or up to $10.93 per share if the period by which we may consummate our initial business combination is extended as set forth above).



We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor has to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2022, we had access to approximately $55,789 not placed in the trust account with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.



If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e. (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of the company’s liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, payments made as “unfair preferences” or “transactions at an undervalue”. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.



Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them.





13







Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of a redemption of the public shares prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by not later than April 23, 2023, (ii) if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate or (iii) if they redeem their shares in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by not later than April 23, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. A shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered, and may continue to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups, venture capital funds leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, and our outstanding rights and warrants and the potential future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have one officer, Dr. Peng Jiang, who is our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and the Chairman of the board of directors. Dr. Jiang is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but he devotes as much of their time as necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time he devotes in any time period may vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



We registered our units, ordinary shares, rights and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.





14







We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or International Financial Reporting Standard as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination by July 23, 2022.



We are required to have our internal control procedures evaluated for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
