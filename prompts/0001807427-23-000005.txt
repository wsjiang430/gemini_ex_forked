Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Owl Rock Capital Corporation III is a Maryland corporation formed on January 27, 2020. We are focused primarily on originating and making loans to, and debt and equity investments in middle-market companies based primarily in the United States. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities including warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company’s common equity. Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. While we believe that current market conditions favor extending credit to middle market companies in the United States, our investment strategy is intended to generate favorable returns across credit cycles with an emphasis on preserving capital.
We define “middle market companies” to generally mean companies with earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) between $10 million and $250 million annually, and/or annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment. We may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets, including the high yield and syndicated loan markets. We generally intend to invest in companies with a low loan-to-value ratio, which we consider to be 50% or below. We target portfolio companies where we can structure larger transactions that comprise 1-2% of our portfolio (with no individual portfolio company generally expected to comprise greater than 5% of our portfolio). Our target credit investments will typically have maturities between three and ten years and generally range in size between $20 million and $250 million. The investment size will vary with the size of our capital base. As of December 31, 2022, excluding certain investments that fall outside our typical borrower profile, our portfolio companies representing 81.6% of our total debt portfolio based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $854 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $183 million.
We expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include “covenant-lite” loans (as defined below), with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to our shareholders. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates.
We are advised by the Adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement. The Adviser is an indirect affiliate of Blue Owl Capital Inc. (“Blue Owl”) (NYSE: OWL) and part of Owl Rock, a division of Blue Owl focused on direct lending. To achieve our investment objective, we will leverage Blue Owl's, and, in particular, the Adviser’s investment team’s extensive network of relationships with other sophisticated institutions to source, evaluate and, as appropriate, partner with on transactions. There are no assurances that we will achieve our investment objective.
Since our Adviser’s affiliates began investment activities in April 2016 through December 31, 2022, our Adviser or its affiliates have originated $72.8 billion aggregate principal amount of investments, of which $69.2 billion of aggregate principal amount of investments prior to any subsequent exits or repayments, was retained by either us or a corporation or fund advised by our Adviser or its affiliates. 
As of December 31, 2022, based on fair value, our portfolio consisted of 78.6% first lien senior secured debt investments, 12.3% second lien senior secured debt investments, 1.5% unsecured debt investments, 4.2% preferred equity investments and 3.4% common equity investments. As of December 31, 2022, 98.2% of our debt investments based on fair value bear interest at a floating rate, subject to interest rate floors, in certain cases. As of December 31, 2022 we had investments in 134 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $3.5 billion. As of December 31, 2022, our portfolio was invested across 27 different industries. The largest industries in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022 were Internet software and services and Insurance, which represented, as a percentage of our portfolio, 17.5% and 10.1%, respectively, based on fair value.
As of December 31, 2022, our average debt investment size in each of our portfolio companies was approximately $25.8 million based on fair value. 
We conduct private offerings (each, a “Private Offering”) of our common shares to accredited investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). At the closing of each Private Offering, each investor makes a capital commitment (a “Capital Commitment”) to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. Until the earlier of a Liquidity Event (as defined below) and the end of the Commitment Period (as defined below), investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of our common stock up to the amount of their respective Capital Commitment on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to our investors. The initial closing of the Private Offering occurred on June 5, 2020 (the “Initial Closing”). We have solicited $1.8 billion in total Capital Commitments from investors, of which $62.4 million is from entities affiliated with or related to our Adviser, and all of which has been drawn as of June 16, 2022. From time to time during the Commitment Period (as defined below), the Adviser may, in its sole discretion, permit one or more additional closings (“Subsequent Closings”) as additional Capital Commitments are obtained (the conclusion of all Subsequent Closings, if any, the “Final Closing”). The “Commitment Period” will continue until the seven year anniversary of the Initial Closing. If we have not consummated a Liquidity Event by the end of the Commitment Period, subject to extension for two additional one-year periods, in the sole discretion of our Board of Directors (the “Board”), the Board (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”)) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner. A Liquidity Event could include: (i) future quotation or listing of the Company’s securities on a national securities exchange (“Exchange Listing"); (ii) a transaction, including a merger, in which shareholders receive cash or shares of an entity, including an entity that is affiliated with us, and such shares are listed on a national securities exchange; or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. See “— The Private Offering.”
If we have not consummated a Liquidity Event by the end of the Commitment Period, subject to extension for two additional one-year periods, in the sole discretion of the Board, the Board (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”)) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve the Company in an orderly manner.
We are an externally managed, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a BDC and a RIC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. As a BDC, at least 70% of our assets must be assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, as described herein. See “— Regulation as a Business Development Company” and “— Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”
We generally intend to distribute, out of assets legally available for distribution, substantially all of our available earnings, on a quarterly basis, as determined by our Board in its sole discretion.
We may borrow money from time to time if immediately after such borrowing, the ratio of our total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to our total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus preferred stock, if any, is at least 150%. This means that generally, we can borrow up to $2 for every $1 of investor equity. We currently have in place a senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and two special purpose vehicle asset credit facilities (the "SPV Asset Facility I" and the "SPV Asset Facility II", respectively), and in the future may enter into additional credit facilities. The special purpose vehicle asset credit facilities are financing facilities pursuant to which we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, or SPV, which enters into a credit agreement. We periodically sell and contribute investments to the SPV and the SPV uses the proceeds from the credit agreement to finance the purchase of assets, including from us. In addition, we have issued unsecured notes maturing in 2027 and July 2025 and July 2027 (the "2027 Notes,” "July 2025 Notes" and "July 2027 Notes," respectively) and in the future may issue additional unsecured notes. We expect to use our credit facilities and other borrowings, along with proceeds from the rotation of our portfolio, to finance our investment objectives. See “— Regulation as a Business Development Company” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations. See “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Debt.”
The Adviser and Administrator — Owl Rock Diversified Advisors LLC
Owl Rock Diversified Advisors LLC serves as our investment adviser pursuant to an amended and restated Investment Advisory Agreement (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”) between us and the Adviser. See “—Investment Advisory Agreement.” The Adviser serves as our Administrator pursuant to an amended and restated Administration Agreement between us and the Adviser (the "Administration Agreement"). See "—Administration Agreement" below. The Adviser is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). The Adviser is an indirect affiliate of Blue Owl and part of Owl Rock, a division of Blue Owl focused on 
direct lending. Owl Rock is led by its three co-founders, Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer. The Adviser’s investment team (the “Investment Team”) is also led by Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer and is supported by certain members of the Adviser’s senior executive team and Investment Committee. The investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) is comprised of Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz, Craig W. Packer, Alexis Maged and Jeff Walwyn. The Investment Team, under the Investment Committee’s supervision, sources investment opportunities, conducts research, performs due diligence on potential investments, structures the Company’s investments and monitors the Company’s portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser has limited operating history. Subject to the overall supervision of the Board, the Adviser manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory and management services to us.
The Adviser is affiliated with Owl Rock Capital Advisors LLC (“ORCA”), Owl Rock Technology Advisors LLC (“ORTA”), Owl Rock Technology Advisors II LLC ("ORTA II"), and Owl Rock Capital Private Fund Advisors LLC (“ORCPFA” and together with the Adviser, ORCA, ORTA, and ORTA II, the “Owl Rock Advisors”). The Owl Rock Advisers are affiliates of Blue Owl. Blue Owl consists of three divisions: Owl Rock, which focuses on direct lending, Dyal, which focuses on providing capital to institutional alternative asset managers and Oak Street, which focuses on real estate strategies. Blue Owl’s products are generally structured as BDCs, real estate investment trusts and private investment funds that aggregate capital from investors. As of December 31, 2022, the Owl Rock division of Blue Owl managed $68.6 billion in AUM. The Owl Rock Advisers focus on direct lending to middle-market companies primarily in the United States through a mix of BDCs, long-dated private funds and other vehicles across the following investment strategies:

Strategy | Funds | Assets Under Management 
Diversified Lending. The diversified lending strategy seeks to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns across credit cycles with an emphasis on preserving capital primarily through originating and making loans to, and making debt and equity investments in, U.S. middle market companies. The diversified lending strategy provides a wide range of financing solutions with strong focus on the top of the capital structure and operate this strategy through diversification by borrower, sector, sponsor, and position size. | The diversified lending strategy is primarily offered through four BDCs: the Company, Owl Rock Capital Corporation (“ORCC”), Owl Rock Capital Corporation II (“ORCC II”), and Owl Rock Core Income Corp. (“ORCIC”); and privatefunds (the "DiversifiedLending Funds"). | As of December 31, 2022, the diversified lending strategy had $39.6 billion of assets under management.


Technology Lending. The technology lending strategy seeks to maximize total return by generating current income from debt investments and other income producing securities, and capital appreciation from equity and equity-linked investments primarily through originating and making loans to, and making debt and equity investments in, technology related companies based primarily in the United States. The technology lending strategy originates and invests in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans, and equity and equity-related securities including common equity, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may be convertible into a portfolio company’s common equity. The technology lending strategy invests in a broad range of established and high growth technology companies that are capitalizing on the large and growing demand for technology products and services. This strategy focuses on companies that operate in technology-related industries or sectors which include, but are not limited to, information technology, application or infrastructure software, financial services, data and analytics, security, cloud computing, communications, life sciences, healthcare, media, consumer electronics, semi-conductor, internet commerce and advertising, environmental, aerospace and defense industries and sectors. | The technology lending strategy is primarily offered through three BDCs: Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. (“ORTF”), Owl Rock Technology Income Corp. ("ORTIC") and Owl Rock Technology Finance Corp. II ("ORTF II" and together with the Company, ORCC, ORCC II, ORCIC, ORTF and ORTIC, the “Owl Rock BDCs”). | As of December 31, 2022, the technology lending strategy had $16.0 billion of assets under management.


First Lien Lending. The first lien lending strategy seeks to realize current income with an emphasis on preservation of capital primarily through originating primary transactions in and, to a lesser extent, secondary transactions of first lien senior secured loans in or related to middle market businesses based primarily in the United States. | The first lien lending strategy is offered through private funds and separately managed accounts. | As of December 31, 2022, the first lien lending strategy had $3.3 billion of assets under management. 
Opportunistic Lending. The opportunistic lending strategy seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by taking advantage of credit opportunities in U.S. middle-market companies with liquidity needs and market leaders seeking to improve their balance sheets. The opportunistic lending strategy focuses on high-quality companies that could be experiencing disruption, dislocation, distress or transformational change. The opportunistic lending strategy aims to be the partner of choice for companies by being well equipped to provide a variety of financing solutions to meet a broad range of situations, including the following: (i) rescue financing, (ii) new issuance and recapitalizations, (iii) wedge capital, (iv) debtor-in-possession loans, (v) financing for additional liquidity and covenant relief and (vi) broken syndications. | The opportunistic lending strategy is offered through private funds and separately managed accounts. | As of December 31, 2022, the opportunistic lending strategy had $2.3 billion of assets under management.

We refer to the Owl Rock BDCs and the private funds and separately managed accounts that comprise Owl Rock, as the “Owl Rock Clients.” In addition to the Owl Rock Clients, the Owl Rock division of Blue Owl includes a CLO strategy that seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by managing portfolios of broadly syndicated leveraged loans. As of December 31, 2022, the CLO strategy had $7.4 billion of assets under management.
The Owl Rock Clients may have overlapping objectives with us. The Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and others. In order to address these conflicts, the Owl Rock Advisers have put in place an investment allocation policy that addresses the allocation of investment opportunities as well as co-investment restrictions under the 1940 Act.
In addition, we rely on an order for exemptive relief (the "Order") that has been granted by the SEC to ORCA and its affiliates to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing, and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit the Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the exemptive relief and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we have received an amendment to the Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company.
The Owl Rock Advisers’ allocation policy incorporates the conditions of the exemptive relief. As a result of the exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of the Owl 
Rock Clients and/or other funds established by the Adviser or its affiliates that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief and that have an investment objective similar to ours. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS —Risks Related to our Adviser and its Affiliates — Our Adviser or its affiliates may have incentives to favor their respective other accounts and clients and/or Blue Owl over us, which may result in conflicts of interest that could be harmful to us.”
The Adviser or its affiliates may engage in certain origination activities and receive attendant arrangement, structuring or similar fees from portfolio companies. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS —Risks Related to our Adviser and its Affiliates —Our Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest with respect to services performed for issuers in which we may invest.”
The Adviser's address is 399 Park Avenue, 37th floor, New York, NY 10022.
Market Trends
Market Trends
We believe the middle-market lending environment provides opportunities for us to meet our goal of making investments that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Limited Availability of Capital for Middle-Market Companies. We believe that regulatory and structural changes in the market have reduced the amount of capital available to U.S. middle-market companies. In particular, we believe there are currently fewer providers of capital to middle market companies. We believe that many commercial and investment banks have, in recent years, de-emphasized their service and product offerings to middle-market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions. In addition, these lenders may be constrained in their ability to underwrite and hold bank loans and high yield securities for middle-market issuers as they seek to meet existing and future regulatory capital requirements. We also believe that there is a lack of market participants that are willing to hold meaningful amounts of certain middle-market loans. As a result, we believe our ability to minimize syndication risk for a company seeking financing by being able to hold its loans without having to syndicate them, coupled with reduced capacity of traditional lenders to serve the middle-market, present an attractive opportunity to invest in middle-market companies.
Capital Markets Have Been Unable to Fill the Void in U.S. Middle Market Finance Left by Banks. While underwritten bond and syndicated loan markets have been robust in recent years, middle market companies are less able to access these markets for reasons including the following:
High Yield Market – Middle market companies generally are not issuing debt in an amount large enough to be an attractively sized bond. High yield bonds are generally purchased by institutional investors who, among other things, are focused on the liquidity characteristics of the bond being issued. For example, mutual funds and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) are significant buyers of underwritten bonds. However, mutual funds and ETFs generally require the ability to liquidate their investments quickly in order to fund investor redemptions and/or comply with regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the existence of an active secondary market for bonds is an important consideration in these entities’ initial investment decision. Because there is typically little or no active secondary market for the debt of U.S. middle market companies, mutual funds and ETFs generally do not provide debt capital to U.S. middle market companies. We believe this is likely to be a persistent problem and creates an advantage for those like us who have a more stable capital base and have the ability to invest in illiquid assets.
Syndicated Loan Market – While the syndicated loan market is modestly more accommodating to middle market issuers, as with bonds, loan issue size and liquidity are key drivers of institutional appetite and, correspondingly, underwriters’ willingness to underwrite the loans. Loans arranged through a bank are done either on a “best efforts” basis or are underwritten with terms plus provisions that permit the underwriters to change certain terms, including pricing, structure, yield and tenor, otherwise known as “flex”, to successfully syndicate the loan, in the event the terms initially marketed are insufficiently attractive to investors. Furthermore, banks are generally reluctant to underwrite middle market loans because the arrangement fees they may earn on the placement of the debt generally are not sufficient to meet the banks’ return hurdles. Loans provided by companies such as ours provide certainty to issuers in that we can commit to a given amount of debt on specific terms, at stated coupons and with agreed upon fees. As we are the ultimate holder of the loans, we do not require market “flex” or other arrangements that banks may require when acting on an agency basis.
Robust Demand for Debt Capital. We believe U.S. middle market companies will continue to require access to debt capital to refinance existing debt, support growth and finance acquisitions. In addition, we believe the large amount of uninvested capital held by funds of private equity firms, estimated by Preqin Ltd., an alternative assets industry data and research company, to be $2.5 trillion as of December 31, 2022, will continue to drive deal activity. We expect that private equity sponsors will continue to pursue acquisitions and leverage their equity investments with secured loans provided by companies such as us.
The Middle Market is a Large Addressable Market. According to GE Capital’s National Center for the Middle Market Mid-Year 2022 Middle Market Indicator, there are approximately 200,000 U.S. middle market companies, which have approximately 48 million aggregate employees. Moreover, the U.S. middle market accounts for one-third of private sector gross domestic product (“GDP”). GE defines U.S. middle market companies as those between $10 million and $1 billion in annual revenue, which we believe has significant overlap with our definition of U.S. middle market companies.
Attractive Investment Dynamics. An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics. We believe the directly negotiated nature of middle market financings also generally provides more favorable terms to the lender, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection, and lender-protective change of control provisions. Additionally, we believe BDC managers’ expertise in credit selection and ability to manage through credit cycles has generally resulted in BDCs experiencing lower loss rates than U.S. commercial banks through credit cycles. Further, we believe that historical middle market default rates have been lower, and recovery rates have been higher, as compared to the larger market capitalization, broadly distributed market, leading to lower cumulative losses. Lastly, we believe that in the current environment, lenders with available capital may be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and may be able to achieve improved economic spreads and documentation terms.
Conservative Capital Structures. Following the credit crisis, which we define broadly as occurring between mid-2007 and mid-2009, lenders have generally required borrowers to maintain more equity as a percentage of their total capitalization, specifically to protect lenders during economic downturns. With more conservative capital structures, U.S. middle market companies have exhibited higher levels of cash flows available to service their debt. In addition, U.S. middle market companies often are characterized by simpler capital structures than larger borrowers, which facilitates a streamlined underwriting process and, when necessary, restructuring process. 
Attractive Opportunities in Investments in Loans. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities. We believe that opportunities in senior secured loans are significant because of the floating rate structure of most senior secured debt issuances and because of the strong defensive characteristics of these types of investments. We believe that debt issued with floating interest rates offer a superior return profile as compared with fixed-rate investments, since floating rate structures are generally less susceptible to declines in value experienced by fixed-rate securities in a rising interest rate environment. Senior secured debt also provides strong defensive characteristics. Senior secured debt has priority in payment among an issuer’s security holders whereby holders are due to receive payment before junior creditors and equity holders. Further, these investments are secured by the issuer’s assets, which may provide protection in the event of a default.
Potential Competitive Advantages
We believe that the Adviser’s disciplined approach to origination, fundamental credit analysis, portfolio construction and risk management should allow us to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns while preserving our capital. We believe that we represent an attractive investment opportunity for the following reasons: 
Experienced Team with Expertise Across all Levels of the Corporate Capital Structure. The members of the Investment Committee have an average of over 25 years of experience in private lending and investing at all levels of a company’s capital structure, particularly in high yield securities, leveraged loans, high yield credit derivatives and distressed securities, as well as experience in operations, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and workout restructuring. The members of the Investment Committee have diverse backgrounds with investing experience through multiple business and credit cycles. Moreover, certain members of the Investment Committee and other executives and employees of the Adviser and its affiliates have operating and/or investing experience on behalf of business development companies. We believe this experience provides the Adviser with an in-depth understanding of the strategic, financial and operational challenges and opportunities of middle market companies and will afford it numerous tools to manage risk while preserving the opportunity for attractive risk-adjusted returns on our investments and offering a diverse product set to help meet borrowers' needs.
Distinctive Origination Platform. To date, a substantial majority of our investments have been sourced directly. We believe that our origination platform provides us the ability to originate investments without the assistance of investment banks or other traditional Wall Street intermediaries. 
The Investment Team includes more than 100 investment professionals and is responsible for originating, underwriting, executing and managing the assets of our direct lending transactions and for sourcing and executing opportunities directly. The Investment Team has significant experience as transaction originators and building and maintaining strong relationships with private equity sponsors and companies. In addition, we believe that as a result of the formation of Blue Owl the investment team has enhanced sourcing capabilities because of their ability to utilize Blue Owl's 
resources and its relationships with the financial sponsor community and service providers, which we believe may broaden our deal funnel and result in an increased pipeline of deal opportunities.
The Investment Team also maintains direct contact with banks, corporate advisory firms, industry consultants, attorneys, investment banks, “club” investors and other potential sources of lending opportunities. We believe the Adviser’s ability to source through multiple channels allows us to generate investment opportunities that have more attractive risk-adjusted return characteristics than by relying solely on origination flow from investment banks or other intermediaries and to be more selective investors. 
Since its inception in April 2016 through December 31, 2022, the Adviser and its affiliates have reviewed over 7,800 opportunities and sourced potential investment opportunities from more than 650 private equity sponsors and venture capital firms. We believe that the Adviser receives “early looks” and “last looks” based on its and Blue Owl's relationships, allowing it to be highly selective in the transactions it pursues.
Potential Long-Term Investment Horizon. We believe our potential long-term investment horizon gives us flexibility, allowing us to maximize returns on our investments. We invest using a long-term focus, which we believe provides us with the opportunity to increase total returns on invested capital, as compared to other private company investment vehicles or investment vehicles with daily liquidity requirements (e.g., open-ended mutual funds and ETFs).
Defensive, Income-Orientated Investment Philosophy. The Adviser employs a defensive investment approach focused on long-term credit performance and principal protection. This investment approach involves a multi-stage selection process for each investment opportunity as well as ongoing monitoring of each investment made, with particular emphasis on early detection of credit deterioration. This strategy is designed to minimize potential losses and achieve attractive risk adjusted returns. 
Active Portfolio Monitoring. The Adviser closely monitors the investments in our portfolio and takes a proactive approach to identifying and addressing sector- or company-specific risks. The Adviser receives and reviews detailed financial information from portfolio companies no less than quarterly and seeks to maintain regular dialogue with portfolio company management teams regarding current and forecasted performance. Although we may invest in “covenant-lite” loans, which generally do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants, we anticipate that many of our investments will have financial covenants that we believe will provide an early warning of potential problems facing our borrowers, allowing lenders, including us, to identify and carefully manage risk. Further, we anticipate that many of our equity investments will provide us the opportunity to nominate a member or observer to the board of directors of the portfolio company or otherwise include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, which we believe will allow us to closely monitor the performance of these portfolio companies. In addition, the Adviser has built out its portfolio management team to include workout experts who closely monitor our portfolio companies and who, on at least a quarterly basis, assess each portfolio company’s operational and liquidity exposure and outlook to understand and mitigate risks; and, on at least a monthly basis, evaluates existing and newly identified situations where operating results are deviating from expectations. As part of its monitoring process, the Adviser focuses on projected liquidity needs and where warranted, re-underwriting credits and evaluating downside and liquidation scenarios.
Investment Selection
The Adviser has identified the following investment criteria and guidelines that it believes are important in evaluating prospective portfolio companies. However, not all of these criteria and guidelines will be met, or will be equally important, in connection with each of our investments. 
Established Companies with Positive Cash Flow. We seek to invest in companies with sound historical financial performance and a history of profitability which we believe tend to be well-positioned to maintain consistent cash flow to service and repay their obligations and maintain growth in their businesses or market share in all market conditions, including in the event of a recession. The Adviser typically focuses on upper middle-market companies with a history of profitability on an operating cash flow basis. The Adviser does not intend to invest in start-up companies that have not achieved sustainable profitability and cash flow generation or companies with speculative business plans. 
Strong Competitive Position in Industry. The Adviser analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of target companies relative to their competitors. The factors the Adviser considers include relative product pricing, product quality, customer loyalty, substitution risk, switching costs, patent protection, brand positioning and capitalization. We seek to invest in companies that have developed leading positions within their respective markets, are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and operate businesses, exhibit the potential to maintain sufficient cash flows and profitability to service their obligations in a range of economic environments or are in industries with significant barriers to entry. We seek companies that demonstrate advantages in scale, scope, customer loyalty, product pricing or product quality versus their competitors that, when compared to their competitors, may help to protect their market position and profitability. 
Experienced Management Team. We seek to invest in companies that have experienced management teams. We also seek to invest in companies that have proper incentives in place, including management teams having significant equity interests to motivate management to act in concert with our interests as an investor. 
Diversified Customer and Supplier Base. We generally seek to invest in companies that have a diversified customer and supplier base. Companies with a diversified customer and supplier base are generally better able to endure economic downturns, industry consolidation, changing business preferences and other factors that may negatively impact their customers, suppliers and competitors.
Exit Strategy. While certain debt investments may be repaid through operating cash flows of the borrower, we expect that the primary means by which we exit our debt investments will be through methods such as strategic acquisitions by other industry participants, an initial public offering of common stock, a recapitalization, a refinancing or another transaction in the capital markets. 
Prior to making an equity investment in a prospective portfolio company, we analyze the potential for that company to increase the liquidity of its equity through a future event that would enable us to realize appreciation in the value of our equity interest. Liquidity events may include an initial public offering, a private sale of our equity interest to a third party, a merger or an acquisition of the company or a purchase of our equity position by the company or one of its stockholders.
In addition, in connection with our investing activities, we may make commitments with respect to an investment in a potential portfolio company substantially in excess of our final investment. In such situations, while we may initially agree to fund up to a certain dollar amount of an investment, we may sell a portion of such amount, such that we are left with a smaller investment than what was reflected in our original commitment.
Financial Sponsorship. We seek to participate in transactions sponsored by what we believe to be high-quality private equity and venture capital firms. We believe that a financial sponsor’s willingness to invest significant sums of equity capital into a company is an explicit endorsement of the quality of their investment. Further, financial sponsors of portfolio companies with significant investments at risk have the ability and a strong incentive to contribute additional capital in difficult economic times should operational issues arise.
Investments in Different Portfolio Companies and Industries. We seek to invest broadly among portfolio companies and industries, thereby potentially reducing the risk of any one company or industry having a disproportionate impact on the value of our portfolio; however, there can be no assurances in this regard. We seek to structure larger transactions and to invest in recession-resistant industries that we are familiar with. We seek to invest not more than 20% of our portfolio in any single industry classification and target portfolio companies that comprise 1-2% of our portfolio (with no individual portfolio company generally expected to comprise greater than 5% of our portfolio).
Investment Process Overview 
Origination and Sourcing. The Investment Team has an extensive network from which to source deal flow and referrals. Specifically, the Adviser sources portfolio investments from a variety of different investment sources, including among others, private equity sponsors, management teams, financial intermediaries and advisers, investment bankers, family offices, accounting firms and law firms. The Adviser focuses on sponsor-led leveraged buyouts, refinancings, recapitalizations and acquisitions and sponsors who value the ability to provide sizeable commitments; flexible and creative solutions; and certainty, speed and transparency. To a lesser extent, the Adviser may invest in broadly syndicated loans. The Adviser believes that its experience across different industries and transaction types makes the Adviser particularly qualified to source, analyze and execute investment opportunities with a focus on downside protection and a return of principal. 
Due Diligence Process. The process through which an investment decision is made involves extensive research into the company, its industry, its growth prospects and its ability to withstand adverse conditions. If one or more members of the Investment Team responsible for the transaction determines that an investment opportunity should be pursued, the Adviser will engage in an intensive due diligence process focused on fundamental credit analysis and downside protection. Though each transaction may involve a somewhat different approach, the Adviser’s diligence of each opportunity could include: 
•understanding the purpose of the loan, the key personnel, the sources and uses of the proceeds; 
•meeting the company’s management and key personnel, including top level executives, to get an insider’s view of the business, and to probe for potential weaknesses in business prospects; 
•checking management’s backgrounds and references;
•performing a detailed review of historical financial performance, including performance through various economic cycles, and the quality of earnings; 
•contacting customers and vendors to assess both business prospects and standard practices; 
•conducting a competitive analysis, and comparing the company to its main competitors on an operating, financial, market share and valuation basis; 
•researching the industry for historic growth trends and future prospects as well as to identify future exit alternatives; 
•assessing asset value and the ability of physical infrastructure and information systems to handle anticipated growth; 
•leveraging the Adviser’s internal resources and network with institutional knowledge of the company’s business; 
•assessing business valuation and corresponding recovery analysis; 
•developing downside financial projections and liquidation analysis;
•reviewing environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) considerations including consulting the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s Engagement Guide for ESG considerations; and 
•investigating legal and regulatory risks and financial and accounting systems and practices. 
Selective Investment Process. After an investment has been identified and preliminary diligence has been completed, an investment committee memorandum is prepared. This report is reviewed by the members of the Investment Team in charge of the potential investment and generally includes information on downside protection, asset coverage and collateral. If these members of the Investment Team are in favor of the potential investment, then a more extensive due diligence process, which may include significant analysis and focus on strategy and potential to recover par in default scenarios is employed. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys, independent accountants, and other third-party consultants and research firms prior to the closing of the investment, as appropriate on a case-by-case basis. 
Structuring and Execution. Approval of an investment requires the approval of a majority of the Investment Committee. Once the Investment Committee has determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, the Adviser works with the management team of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, if any, to finalize the structure and terms of the investment. With respect to an investment in broadly syndicated loans, a majority of the Investment Committee may approve parameters or guidelines pursuant to which the investment may be made.
Inclusion of Covenants. Covenants are contractual restrictions that lenders place on companies to limit the corporate actions a company may pursue. Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company’s financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may invest in “covenant-lite” loans. We use the term “covenant-lite” to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, “covenant-lite” loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower’s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in “covenant-lite” loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants.
Portfolio Monitoring. The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to our investment in each portfolio company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: 
•assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 
•periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
•comparisons to other companies in the portfolio company’s industry; 
•attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and 
•review of periodic financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 
An investment will be placed on the Adviser's credit watch list when select events occur and will only be removed from the watch list with the oversight of the Investment Committee and/or other Owl Rock agent. Once an investment is on the credit watch list, the Adviser works with the borrower prior to payment default to resolve financial stress through amendments, waivers or other alternatives. If a borrower defaults on its payment obligations, the Adviser's focus shifts to capital recovery. If an investment needs to be restructured, the Adviser's workout team partners with the investment team and all material amendments, waivers and restructurings require the approval of a majority of the Investment Committee.
Structure of Investments 
Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. 
We expect that generally our portfolio composition will be majority debt or income producing securities, which may include “covenant-lite” loans, with a lesser allocation to equity or equity-linked opportunities. In addition, we may invest a portion of our portfolio in opportunistic investments, which will not be our primary focus, but will be intended to enhance returns to our shareholders and from time to time, we may evaluate and enter into strategic portfolio transactions which may result in portfolio companies which we are considered to control. These investments may include high-yield bonds and broadly-syndicated loans, which are typically originated and structured by banks on behalf of large corporate borrowers with employee counts, revenues, EBITDAs and enterprise values larger than the middle market characteristics described herein, and equity investments in portfolio companies that make senior secured loans or invest in broadly syndicated loans or structured products, such as life settlements and royalty interests. Our portfolio composition may fluctuate from time to time based on market conditions and interest rates.
Covenants are contractual restrictions that lenders place on companies to limit the corporate actions a company may pursue. Generally, the loans in which we expect to invest will have financial maintenance covenants, which are used to proactively address materially adverse changes in a portfolio company’s financial performance. However, to a lesser extent, we may invest in “covenant-lite” loans. See “— Investment Process Overview – Inclusion of Covenants.”
Debt Investments. The terms of our debt investments are tailored to the facts and circumstances of each transaction. The Adviser negotiates the structure of each investment to protect our rights and manage our risk. We intend to invest in the following types of debt: 
•First-lien debt. First-lien debt typically is senior on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer’s capital structure and has the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans, “unitranche” loans (including “last out” portions of such loans), and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. As of December 31, 2022, 73.2% of our first lien debt was comprised of unitranche loans.
•Stand-alone first lien loans. Stand-alone first-lien loans are traditional first-lien loans. All lenders in the facility have equal rights to the collateral that is subject to the first-priority security interest. 
•Unitranche loans. Unitranche loans (including the “last out” portions of such loans) combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position. In many cases, we may provide the issuer most, if not all, of the capital structure above their equity. The primary advantages to the issuer are the ability to negotiate the entire debt financing with one lender and the elimination of intercreditor issues. “Last out” first-lien loans have a secondary priority behind super-senior “first out” first-lien loans in the collateral securing the loans in certain circumstances. The arrangements for a “last out” first-lien loan are typically set forth in an “agreement among lenders,” which provides lenders with “first out” and “last out” payment streams based on a single lien on the collateral. Since the “first out” lenders generally have priority over the “last out” lenders for receiving payment under certain specified events of default, or upon the occurrence of other triggering events under intercreditor agreements or agreements among lenders, the “last out” lenders bear a greater risk and, in exchange, receive a higher effective interest rate, through arrangements among the lenders, than the “first out” lenders or lenders in stand-alone first-lien loans. Agreements among lenders also typically provide greater voting rights to the “last out” lenders than the intercreditor agreements to which second-lien lenders often are subject. Among the types of first-lien debt in which we may invest, 
“last out” first-lien loans generally have higher effective interest rates than other types of first-lien loans, since “last out” first-lien loans rank below standalone first-lien loans. 
•Second-lien debt. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt. Second-lien debt typically is senior on a lien basis to unsecured liabilities in the issuer’s capital structure and has the benefit of a security interest over assets of the issuer, though ranking junior to first-lien debt secured by those assets. First-lien lenders and second-lien lenders typically have separate liens on the collateral, and an intercreditor agreement provides the first-lien lenders with priority over the second-lien lenders’ liens on the collateral. 
•Broadly Syndicated Loans. Broadly syndicated loans (whose features are similar to those described under “First-lien debt” and “Second-lien debt” above) are typically originated and structured by banks on behalf of large corporate borrowers with employee counts, revenues, EBITDAs and enterprise values larger than the middle-market characteristics described above. The proceeds of broadly syndicated loans are often used for leveraged buyout transactions, mergers and acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings, and financing capital expenditures. Broadly syndicated loans are typically distributed by the arranging bank to a diverse group of investors primarily consisting of: CLOs; senior secured loan and high yield bond mutual funds; closed-end funds, hedge funds, banks, and insurance companies; and finance companies. A borrower must comply with various covenants contained in a loan agreement or note purchase agreement between the borrower and the holders of the broadly syndicated loan. The broadly syndicated loans in which we invest may include loans that are considered “covenant-lite” loans, because of their lack of a full set of financial maintenance covenants.
•Mezzanine debt. Structurally, mezzanine debt usually ranks subordinate in priority of payment to first-lien and second-lien debt, is often unsecured, and may not have the benefit of financial covenants common in first-lien and second-lien debt. However, mezzanine debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in an issuer’s capital structure. Mezzanine debt investments generally offer lenders fixed returns in the form of interest payments, which could be paid-in-kind, and may provide lenders an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation, if any, of an issuer through an equity interest. This equity interest typically takes the form of an equity co-investment or warrants. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants compared to senior secured loans, mezzanine debt generally bears a higher stated interest rate than first-lien and second-lien debt. 
Our debt investments are typically structured with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our total return target. The Adviser seeks to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 
•requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk; 
•negotiating covenants in connection with our investments consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative covenants (including reporting requirements), negative covenants (including financial maintenance covenants), lien protection, limitations on debt incurrence, restrictions on asset sales, downside and liquidation cases, restrictions on dividends and other payments, cash flow sweeps, collateral protection, required debt amortization, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation rights or rights to a seat on the board under some circumstances; and
•including debt amortization requirements, where appropriate, to require the timely repayment of principal of the loan, as well as appropriate maturity dates. 
Within our portfolio, the Adviser aims to maintain the appropriate proportion among the various types of first-lien loans, as well as second-lien debt and mezzanine debt, to allow us to achieve our target returns while maintaining our targeted amount of credit risk. 
Equity Investments. Our investment in a portfolio company could be or may include an equity interest, such as common stock or preferred stock, or equity linked interest, such as a warrant or profit participation right. We may make direct and indirect equity investments with or without a concurrent investment in a more senior part of the capital structure of the issuer. Our equity investments are typically not control-oriented investments and we may structure such equity investments to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder.
Specialty Financing Portfolio Companies. We may make equity investments in portfolio companies that make senior secured loans or invest in broadly syndicated loans or structured products, such as life settlements and royalty interests. Our specialty financing companies include the following:
•Amergin, which consists of AAM Series 1.1 Rail and Domestic Intermodal Feeder, LLC and AAM Series 2.1 Aviation Feeder, LLC (collectively, “Amergin AssetCo”) and Amergin Asset Management, LLC, which has entered into a Servicing Agreement with Amergin AssetCo. Amergin was created to invest in a leasing platform focused on railcar and aviation assets.
•Fifth Season Investments LLC (fka Chapford SMA Partnership, L.P. ("Fifth Season")), a portfolio company created to invest in life settlement assets.
•LSI Financing 1 DAC (“LSI Financing”), a portfolio company formed to acquire a contractual right to revenue pursuant to an earnout agreement in the life sciences space.
Investments; Investment Portfolio
Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. Our investment strategy focuses primarily on originating and making loans to, and making debt and equity investments in, U.S. middle-market companies and is intended to generate favorable returns across credit cycles with an emphasis on preserving capital. We invest in senior secured or unsecured loans, subordinated loans or mezzanine loans and, to a lesser extent, equity and equity-related securities, including common and preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock, and warrants. We define “middle-market companies” to generally mean companies with earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, or “EBITDA,” between $10 million and $250 million annually and/or annual revenue of $50 million to $2.5 billion at the time of investment. We may on occasion invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself, especially when there are dislocations in the capital markets, including the high yield and large syndicated loan markets. Consistent with our goal of capital preservation, we generally intend to invest in companies with loan-to-value ratios of 50% or lower. Our target credit investments will typically have maturities between three and ten years. We target portfolio companies that comprise 1-2% of our portfolio (with no individual portfolio company generally expected to comprise greater than 5% of our portfolio). To a lesser extent, we may make investments in syndicated loan opportunities for cash management purposes. While our investment strategy focuses primarily on middle-market companies in the United States, including senior secured loans, we also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in investments of non-qualifying portfolio companies.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 we had investments in 134 and 87 portfolio companies, respectively, with an aggregate fair value of $3.5 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, investments consisted of the following:

Capital Resources and Borrowings
We anticipate generating cash in the future from the issuance of common stock and debt securities and cash flows from operations, including interest and dividends received on our debt and equity investments, respectively.
We may borrow money from time to time if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after such borrowing. Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. Our current target leverage ratio is 0.90x-1.25x. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our asset coverage was 207% and 233%, respectively. See “Regulation as a Business Development Company – Senior Securities” below.
Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must take provisions to prohibit any distribution to our shareholders (which may cause us to fail to distribute amounts necessary to avoid entity-level taxation under the Code), or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In addition, we must also comply with positive and negative covenants customary for these types of facilities.

See “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS —Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources — Debt”.
Dividend Policy
To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends of an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest, the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as well as other taxable income, excluding any net capital gains reduced by deductible expenses) and 90% of our net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on our investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to shareholders. We may be subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax if we do not distribute (or are treated as distributing) in each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of:
•98% of our net ordinary income, excluding certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized during a calendar year;
•98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and 
•100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.
In the future, we can be expected to incur such excise tax on a portion of our income and gains. While we intend to distribute income and capital gains to minimize exposure to the 4% excise tax, we may not be able to, or may not choose to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS – Risks Related to U.S. Federal Income Tax – We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates if we are unable to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code or if we make investments through taxable subsidiaries.”
On February 21, 2023, our Board declared a distribution of 90% of estimated first quarter taxable income and net capital gains, if any, for shareholders of record on March 31, 2023, payable on or before May 15, 2023.
The following table reflects the distributions declared on shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022:

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who do not elect to receive their distribution in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our shareholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. Any fractional share otherwise issuable to a participant in the dividend reinvestment plan will instead be paid in cash.
The number of shares to be issued to a shareholder under the dividend reinvestment plan will be determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the distribution payable to such shareholder by the net asset value per share of our common stock, as of the last day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the date such distribution was declared. We intend to use newly issued shares to implement the plan.
No action is required on the part of a registered shareholder to have cash dividends or other distributions reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered shareholder is able to elect to receive an entire cash dividend or other distribution in cash by notifying the Adviser in writing so that such notice is received by the Adviser no later than ten days prior to the record date for distributions to the shareholders.
There are no brokerage charges or other charges to shareholders who participate in the plan.
The plan is terminable by us upon notice in writing mailed to each shareholder of record at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any distribution by us.
Competition
Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle market companies include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. Many of these competitors have similar investment objectives to us, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our investment opportunities. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Further, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company, or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to qualify for RIC tax treatment. Lastly, institutional and individual investors are allocating increasing amounts of capital to alternative investment strategies. Several large institutional investors have announced a desire to consolidate their investments in a more limited number of managers. We expect that this will cause competition in our industry to intensify and could lead to a reduction in the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many of our products seek to exploit. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risk Related to Our Business — We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could delay further deployment of our capital, reduce returns and result in losses.”
Investment Advisory Agreement
The description below of the Investment Advisory Agreement is only a summary and is not necessarily complete. The description set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Investment Advisory Agreement.
Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is responsible for the following:
•managing our assets in accordance with our investment objective, policies and restrictions;
•determining the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
•making investment decisions for us, including negotiating the terms of investments in, and dispositions of, portfolio securities and other instruments on our behalf;
•monitoring our investments;
•performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies;
•exercising voting rights in respect of portfolio securities and other investments for us;
•serving on, and exercising observer rights for, boards of directors and similar committees of our portfolio companies; and
•providing us with such other investment advisory and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of capital.
The Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.
Term 
The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective on May 18, 2021. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for two years from the date it first became effective and from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the independent directors. On May 3, 2022, the Board approved the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement.
The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate within the meaning of the 1940 Act and related SEC guidance and interpretations in the event of its assignment. In accordance with the 1940 Act, without payment of penalty, we may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser upon 60 days’ written notice. The decision to terminate the agreement may be made by a majority of the Board or the shareholders holding a Majority of the Outstanding Shares of our common stock. “Majority of the Outstanding Shares” means the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock present at a meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of common stock are present or represented by proxy or (2) a majority of outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, without payment of penalty, the Adviser may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice. 
Compensation of Adviser
We will pay the Adviser an investment advisory fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components: a management fee (the “Management Fee”) and an incentive fee (the “Incentive Fee”). The cost of both the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders.
The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Prior to the future quotation or listing of our securities on a national securities exchange (an “Exchange Listing”), the Management Fee is payable at an annual rate of 0.50% of our average gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts, at the end of our two most recently completed calendar quarters.
Following an Exchange Listing, the Management Fee is payable at an annual rate of:
(i)1.5% of our average gross assets that is above an asset coverage ratio of 200% calculated in accordance with Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters payable quarterly in arrears, and
(ii)1.00% of our average gross assets that is below an asset coverage ratio of 200% calculated in accordance with Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters payable quarterly in arrears.
The Management Fee will be appropriately prorated and adjusted (based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter) for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant calendar quarters and for any partial month or quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, gross assets means our total assets determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts.
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will not be entitled to an incentive fee prior to an Exchange Listing. Following an Exchange Listing, the incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income and a portion is based on our capital gains, each as described below. 
The portion of the incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net income will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears commencing with the first calendar quarter following an Exchange Listing, and will equal 100% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of a 1.5% quarterly “hurdle rate,” until the Adviser has received 17.5% of the total pre-incentive fee net investment income for that calendar quarter and, for pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of 1.82% quarterly, 17.5% of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income for that calendar quarter. The 100% “catch-up” provision for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the 1.5% “hurdle rate” is intended to provide the Adviser with an Incentive Fee of 17.5% on all pre-Incentive Fee net investment income when that amount equals 1.82% in a calendar quarter (7.27% annualized), which, in each case, is the rate at which catch-up is achieved. Once the “hurdle rate” is reached and catch-up is achieved, 17.5% of any pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.82% in any calendar quarter is payable to the Adviser.
Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income means dividends (including reinvested dividends), interest and fee income accrued by us during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the calendar quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to the Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest (“PIK”) and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we may not have received in cash. The Adviser is not obligated to return the Incentive Fee it receives on PIK interest that is later determined to be uncollectible in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
To determine whether pre-Incentive Fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, pre-Incentive Fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter commencing with the first calendar quarter following an Exchange Listing. Because of the structure of the Incentive Fee, it is possible that we may pay an Incentive Fee in a calendar quarter in which we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable Incentive Fee even if we have incurred a loss in that calendar quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. In addition, because the quarterly hurdle rate is calculated based on our net assets, decreases in our net assets due to realized or unrealized capital losses in any given calendar quarter may increase the likelihood that the hurdle rate is reached and therefore the likelihood that we will pay an Incentive Fee for that calendar quarter. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the Management Fee because gross assets are total assets (including cash received) before deducting liabilities (such as declared dividend payments).
The following is a graphical representations of the calculation of the income-related portion of the Incentive Fee:
Quarterly Incentive Fee on
Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
Subsequent to an Exchange Listing
(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets)

0% | 1.5% | 1.82% 
← 0% → | ← 100% → | ← 17.5% →

Percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income
Allocated to Quarterly Incentive Fee
The second component of the Incentive Fee, the “Capital Gains Incentive Fee,” payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears, equals, subsequent to an Exchange Listing, 17.5% of cumulative realized capital gains from the date on which the Exchange Listing, if any, becomes effective (the “Listing Date”) to the end of each calendar year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the Listing Date to the end of each calendar year. Each year, the fee paid for the Capital Gains Incentive Fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Incentive Fee for prior periods. We will accrue, but will not pay, a Capital Gains Incentive Fee with respect to unrealized appreciation because a Capital Gains Incentive Fee would be owed to the Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. The fees that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. For the sole purpose of calculating the Capital Gains Incentive Fee, the cost 
basis as of the Listing Date for all of our investments made prior to the Listing Date will be equal to the fair market value of such investments as of the last day of the calendar quarter in which the Listing Date occurs; provided, however, that in no event will the Capital Gains Fee payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement be in excess of the amount permitted by the Advisers Act, including Section 205 thereof.
Limitations of Liability and Indemnification
The Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including without limitation its sole member, are not liable to us for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Adviser in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser (except to the extent specified in Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act, as amended, concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty (as the same is finally determined by judicial proceedings) with respect to the receipt of compensation for services).
We will indemnify the Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including without limitation its general partner or managing member (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) and hold them harmless from and against all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason of any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of us or our security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Adviser’s duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. However, the Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification in respect of, any liability to us or our shareholders to which the Indemnified Parties would otherwise be subject by reason of criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the Adviser’s duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of the Adviser’s duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement.
Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement
On May 3, 2022, the Board held a meeting to consider and approve the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement and related matters. The Board was provided with information it required to consider the Investment Advisory Agreement, including: (a) the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by the Adviser; (b) comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs, which could include employees of the Adviser or its affiliates; (c) our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives; (d) any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the Adviser from its relationship with us and the profitability of that relationship; (e) information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; (f) the organizational capability and financial condition of the Adviser and its affiliates; and (g) the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third-party service providers or through an internally managed structure.
Based on the information reviewed and the discussion thereof, the Board, including a majority of the non-interested directors, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates are reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as being in the best interests of our shareholders.
Administration Agreement
The description below of the Administration Agreement is only a summary and is not necessarily complete. The description set forth below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Administration Agreement.
Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser performs, or oversees the performance of, administrative services for us, which includes, but is not limited to, providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to shareholders and reports filed with the SEC, managing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others, which could include employees of the Adviser or its affiliates. We will reimburse the Adviser for services performed for us pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we will reimburse the Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. To the extent that the Adviser outsources any of its functions we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Adviser.
The Administration Agreement became effective May 18, 2021 and the continuation of the Administration Agreement was approved by the Board on May 3, 2022. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date it first becomes effective and will remain in effect for two years from the date it first became effective and from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by a majority of the Board or by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities and, in each case, a majority of the 
independent directors. We may terminate the Administration Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon 60 days' written notice. The decision to terminate the agreement may be made by a majority of the Board or the shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, the Adviser may terminate the Administration Agreement, without payment of any penalty, upon 60 days' written notice. 
The Administration Agreement provides that the Adviser and its affiliates' respective officers, directors, members, managers, stockholders and employees are entitled to indemnification from us from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Administration Agreement, except where attributable to willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of such person's duties or reckless disregard of such person's obligations and duties under the Administration Agreement.
Payment of Our Expenses under the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreements
Except as specifically provided below, we anticipate that all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. In addition, the Adviser shall be solely responsible for any placement or “finder’s” fees payable to placement agents engaged by us or our affiliates in connection with the offering of securities by us.

Placement Agent Agreement and Dealer Manager Agreement
On June 4, 2020, we and the Adviser entered into a dealer manager agreement (the “Dealer Manager Agreement”) with Blue Owl Securities LLC (formerly, Owl Rock Capital Securities LLC) (“Blue Owl Securities”), pursuant to which Blue Owl Securities and certain participating broker-dealers will solicit Capital Commitments. In addition, we have entered into a placement agent agreement (the “Placement Agent Agreement”) with Blue Owl Securities pursuant to which employees of Blue Owl Securities may conduct placement activities. Blue Owl Securities, an affiliate of Blue Owl, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In addition, from time to time we may enter into agreements with additional broker-dealers or placement agents to solicit Capital Commitments. Fees paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid by our Adviser.
The Placement Agent Agreement may be terminated by either party thereto upon 30 days written notice to the other party. The Dealer Manager Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons”, as defined in the 1940 Act, and who have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of our distribution plan or the Dealer Manager Agreement or by vote a majority of the outstanding voting securities, on not more than 60 days’ written notice to Blue Owl Securities and the Adviser. 
Affiliated Transactions
We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We rely on the Order to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or certain affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such Order, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing, and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit our Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we have received an amendment to the Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio companies.
License Agreement
We have entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”) pursuant to which an affiliate of Blue Owl has granted us a non-exclusive license to use the name “Owl Rock.” Under the License Agreement, we have a right to use the Owl Rock name for so long as the Adviser or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the “Owl Rock” name or logo.
Term
Prior to a Liquidity Event (as defined below), if the Board determines that there has been a significant adverse change in the regulatory or tax treatment of us or our shareholders that in its judgment makes it inadvisable for us to continue in its present form, then the Board will endeavor to restructure or change our form to preserve (insofar as possible) the overall benefits previously enjoyed by shareholders as a whole or, if the Board determines it appropriate (and subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the 1940 Act), (i) cause us to change our form and/or jurisdiction of organization or (ii) cause us to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve.
If we have not consummated a Liquidity Event by the seven-year anniversary of the Initial Closing, subject to extension for two additional one-year periods, in the sole discretion of the Board, the Board (subject to any necessary shareholder approvals and applicable requirements of the 1940 Act) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause us to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve in an orderly manner.
“Liquidity Event” means (i) an Exchange Listing; (ii) a transaction, including a merger, in which shareholders receive cash or shares of an entity, including an entity that is affiliated with us, and such shares are listed on a national securities exchange; or (iii) the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of Common Stock would be entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we have paid or otherwise provide for all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock, if any preferred stock is outstanding at such time. For the purposes of this paragraph, a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation or other entity, or a sale or conveyance of all or any part of its property or assets will not be deemed to be a dissolution, liquidation or winding up, voluntary or involuntary.
Emerging Growth Company
 We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 and we are eligible to take advantage of certain specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). We expect to remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) December 31 of the fiscal year that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the 1934 Act which would occur if the market value of Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period. In addition, we intend to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
Employees
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of the Adviser or its affiliates, pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Each of our executive officers is employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Adviser. The services necessary for the origination and administration of our investment portfolio are provided by investment professionals employed by the Adviser or its affiliates. The Investment Team is focused on origination and transaction development and the ongoing monitoring of our investments. In addition, we reimburse the Adviser for the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staffs (based on the percentage of time such individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs and as otherwise set forth in the Administrative Agreement). See “— Investment Advisory Agreement” and “— Administration Agreement.”
Corporate Sustainability
Our and the Adviser’s corporate sustainability efforts seek to deliver positive outcomes for our investors and the communities in which we operate. Our Board receives annual updates on the Adviser’s strategy and initiatives, including ESG-related matters. 
Investing Responsibly
We and the Adviser recognize the importance of ESG risks and opportunities and are committed to the consideration of these factors in relation to our business operations and investment activities. Blue Owl is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (“PRI”) and incorporates core principles based on PRI standards into its ESG Policy. This policy applies to all asset classes, industries and countries in which Blue Owl does business and the funds it manages.
The Adviser believes that incorporating ESG factors into our corporate and investment practices has the potential to meaningfully contribute to our long-term financial success. The Adviser strives to continuously strengthen its ability to mitigate, manage, and monitor relevant ESG risks and opportunities within our investment portfolios. When the Adviser makes investments, it strives to analyze a wide array of considerations, risks, and potential rewards related to the prospective investment. This could include, but is not limited to, considering business-relevant ESG risks such as: regulatory, tax, governance, occupational health and safety, labor standards, geopolitical risk, etc. Further, the Adviser seeks to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory disclosure requirements, including ESG-related disclosure obligations.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We and the Adviser are committed to fostering and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. The Adviser prizes diversity in its team and seek to create an inclusive, merit-based environment that is supportive of people from all backgrounds. Blue Owl has formalized its approach by adopting a formal DEI Policy.
To further foster an inclusive culture, Blue Owl seeks to continue to establish relevant and appropriate employee resource groups. In 2022, it established The Parliament, a network for women with a mission to support, enhance, and advance the experience of women at Blue Owl and to enhance gender equity across the firm. Blue Owl has hosted events for The Parliament to highlight women leaders in the financial industry, provide connection and promote mental health. Blue Owl also works with select partners on DEI initiatives, including Black Women in Asset Management, 100 Women in Finance and The Opportunity Network. Blue Owl’s signature partnership with The Opportunity Network launched a summer internship program for college students from backgrounds that are often underrepresented in the finance industry. This program includes training for both supervisors and interns, professional development sessions, networking opportunities and mentorship. In addition, Blue Owl has conducted DEI-related training on implicit bias for all of its employees.
Citizenship
Blue Owl seeks to engage with its stakeholders to support the causes most important to its communities. Blue Owl takes its role as a corporate citizen seriously and aims to leverage its resources for social good by contributing to meaningful causes and by partnering with various organizations to support the communities in which it operates and resides. Blue Owl encourages and facilitates opportunities for staff to give back to its communities, including through financial support and in-kind donations of its employees’ time. In 2022, Blue Owl expanded its tradition of holiday giving to a global campaign across eight offices, partnering with local organizations to help children and families in need.
The Private Offering
We have entered into separate subscription agreements with a number of investors providing for the private placement of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Private Offering and may enter into additional subscription agreements from time to time. Each investor will make a Capital Commitment to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement. Investors will be required to make capital contributions to purchase shares of our common stock each time we deliver a drawdown notice, which will be issued based on our anticipated investment activities and capital needs, in an aggregate amount not to exceed each investor’s respective Capital Commitment. We will deliver drawdown requests at least ten business days prior to the required funding date. All purchases of our common stock will generally be made pro rata in accordance with remaining Capital Commitments of all investors, at a per-share price equal to the net asset value per share of our common stock subject to any adjustments. Any adjustments would take into account a determination of changes to net asset value within 48 hours of the sale to assure compliance with Section 23(b) of the 1940 Act. At the earlier of (i) an Exchange Listing and (ii) the end of the Commitment Period, shareholders will be 
released from any further obligation to fund drawdowns and purchase additional shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions described in the subscription agreement. 
If, during the Commitment Period, two of the four of Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz, Craig W. Packer and Alan J. Kirshenbaum (each, a “Key Person”), (i) provide notice of resignation, resign, are terminated or are provided with notice of termination from the position of (1) in the case of Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer, co-chief investment officer of the Adviser and (2) in the case of Alan J. Kirshenbaum, chief financial officer of the Adviser, (ii) die or are disabled or (iii) cease to be actively involved (1) in the case of Douglas I. Ostrover, Marc S. Lipschultz and Craig W. Packer, as a member of the Investment Committee or (2) in the case of Alan J. Kirshenbaum, as an officer of the Adviser, for any consecutive period exceeding 60 days, a “Key Person Event” will have occurred. For purposes of this provision, the Adviser is permitted at any time to replace one of the Key Persons with a senior professional selected by the Adviser, provided that such replacement is approved by 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock. 
A “Cause Event” will occur if, during the Commitment Period, an event constituting Cause occurs. “Cause” means (A) any disqualification of a Key Person under Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act; (B) the conviction of (or plea of no contest by) any Key Person of a felony involving fraud, false statements or omissions, wrongful taking of property, bribery, perjury, forgery, counterfeiting, extortion, or conspiracy to commit such offenses; (C) the final judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence by the Adviser or any Key Person in the performance of its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement; or (D) the conviction of (or a plea of no contest by) any Key Person or the Adviser of a violation of the substantive provisions of any U.S. federal or state securities law (other than any inadvertent or technical violation of any such law which has no material adverse impact on the Company or any other violation which has no material adverse impact on the Company).
Upon the occurrence of a Key Person Event or a Cause Event, we will send written notice of the Key Person Event or Cause Event, as applicable, to our shareholders within ten Business Days of such occurrence, the Commitment Period will automatically be suspended for 90 days (the “Interim Period”) and our shareholders will not be obligated to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of our common stock except for certain limited purposes. During the Interim Period we will convene a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of determining whether the Commitment Period should be reinstated. If the proposal is approved by 75% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and all of the independent members of the Board vote in favor the proposal, the Commitment Period will be reinstated and our shareholders will be obligated to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of our common stock as if a Key Person Event or Cause Event, as applicable, had never occurred. Otherwise, the Commitment Period will be deemed to have terminated upon the occurrence of the Key Person Event or Cause Event, as applicable.
Placement activities are conducted by officers of the Company and the Adviser. Blue Owl Securities, an affiliate of Blue Owl, serves as the dealer manager for the private offering and may serve as the dealer manager for other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates. Blue Owl Securities is registered as a broker dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In addition, we have entered and may, from time to time, enter into agreements with other placement agents or broker-dealers to solicit Capital Commitments. Fees paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid by our Adviser. 
Regulation as a Business Development Company
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than "interested persons," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act.
In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a Majority of the Outstanding Shares of our common stock. 
We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if (1) our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders, and (2) our shareholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities.
As a BDC, the ratio of our total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to our total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus preferred stock, if any, must be at least 200% (or 150% if certain conditions are met). This means that generally, we can borrow up to $1 for every $1 of investor equity (or, if certain 
conditions are met, we can borrow up to $2 for every $1 of investor equity). The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to double the amount of leverage it could incur. 
On June 4, 2020, our Adviser, as our sole initial shareholder, approved a proposal that allows us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150% and in connection with their subscription agreements, our investors are required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150%.
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act. 
Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate or currency fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. 
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Prior to January 19, 2021 except for registered money market funds, we generally were prohibited from acquiring more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, investing more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company, or investing more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company without obtaining exemptive relief from the SEC. However, the SEC adopted new rules, which became effective on January 19, 2021, that allow us to acquire the securities of other investment companies in excess of the 3%, 5%, and 10% limitations without obtaining exemptive relief if we comply with certain conditions. If we invest in securities issued by investment companies, if any, it should be noted that such investments might subject our shareholders to additional expenses as they will be indirectly responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies.
None of our investment policies are fundamental, and thus may be changed without shareholder approval.
Qualifying Assets. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
(1)Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
(a)is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b)is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
(c)satisfies any of the following:
(i)does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
(ii)has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
(iii)is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company and the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
(iv)is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million.
(2)Securities of any eligible portfolio company controlled by the Company.
(3)Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
(4)Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and the Company already owns 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
(5)Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
(6)Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a business development company must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company, but may exist in other circumstances based on the facts and circumstances.
The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. The Company may adjust its investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies. A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance, although this may not be the sole method by which the BDC satisfies the requirement to make available managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company’s officers or other organizational or financial guidance.
Temporary Investments. Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments can consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which are referred to herein, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets would be qualifying assets. We may invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. government agency notes, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. Consequently, repurchase agreements are functionally similar to loans. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, the 1940 Act and certain diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes typically require us to limit the amount we invest with any one counterparty. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. The Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we may enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Warrants. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the issuance, terms and amount of warrants, options or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years, (ii) the exercise or 
conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii) shareholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and the Board approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in our best interests and the shareholders best interests and (iv) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, as well as options and rights, at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock.
Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio. We are generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if immediately after such borrowing or issuance, the ratio of our total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to our total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus preferred stock, if any, is at least 200% (or 150%, if certain requirements are met). This means that generally, a BDC can borrow up to $1 for every $1 of investor equity or, if certain requirements are met and it reduces its asset coverage ratio, it can borrow up to $2 for every $1 of investor equity. The reduced asset coverage requirement would permit a BDC to double the amount of leverage it could incur. 
On June 4, 2020, our Adviser, as our sole initial shareholder, approved a proposal that allows us to reduce our asset coverage ratio to 150% and in connection with their subscription agreements, our investors are required to acknowledge our ability to operate with an asset coverage ratio that may be as low as 150%.
In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we will be required to make provisions to prohibit any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. We will also be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Business Development Companies — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC affect our ability to raise capital and the way in which we raise additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including risks associated with leverage.”
Codes of Ethics. We and the Adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code are permitted to invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. Our code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.
Affiliated Transactions. We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from conducting certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We rely on the Order to co-invest with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to such exemptive relief, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the “1940 Act”) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing, and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit our Adviser or its affiliates or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the exemptive relief and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we have received an amendment to the Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not have an investment in such existing portfolio company. The Owl Rock Advisers’ allocation policy incorporates the conditions of the exemptive relief and seeks to ensure equitable allocation of investment opportunities between the Company and/or other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates over time. As a result of exemptive relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company’s investment portfolio and the investment portfolio of other Owl Rock Clients that could avail themselves of the exemptive relief and that have an investment objective similar to ours.
Cancellation of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Under the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by the Adviser. See “— Investment Advisory Agreement – Term.” The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time, without penalty, by us upon not less than 60 days’ written notice to the Adviser and may be terminated at any time, without penalty, by the Adviser upon 60 days’ written notice to us. The holders of a Majority of our Outstanding Shares may also terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice. Unless terminated earlier as described above, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from the date it first became effective and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if approved annually by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a Majority of our Outstanding Shares, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons” as defined in the 1940 Act.
Other. We have adopted an investment policy that complies with the requirements applicable to us as a BDC. We expect to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act, and will be subject to the periodic reporting and related requirements of the Exchange Act.
We are also required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to our shareholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
We are also required to designate a chief compliance officer and to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation.
We are not permitted to change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a Majority of the Outstanding Shares of our common stock. 
Rule 18f-4 under the 1940 Act requires BDCs that use derivatives to, among other things, comply with a value-at-risk leverage limit, adopt a derivatives risk management program, and implement certain testing and board reporting procedures. Rule 18f-4 exempts BDCs that qualify as “limited derivatives users” from the aforementioned requirements, provided that these BDCs adopt written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage the BDC’s derivatives risks and comply with certain recordkeeping requirements. We currently do not use derivatives and, as a result, we qualify as a limited derivatives user and expect to continue to do so. We have adopted a derivatives policy and comply with the recordkeeping requirements of Rule 18f-4.
We intend to operate as a non-diversified management investment company; however, we are currently and may, from time to time, in the future, be considered a diversified management investment company pursuant to the definitions set forth in the 1940 Act.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our common stock. This discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such an investment. For example, this discussion does not describe tax consequences that we have assumed to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including persons who hold our common stock as part of a straddle or a hedging, integrated or constructive sale transaction, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, brokers or dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, U.S. expatriates, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, personal holding companies, persons who acquire an interest in the Company in connection with the performance of services, and financial institutions. Such persons should consult with their own tax advisers as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our common stock, which may differ substantially from those described herein. This discussion assumes that shareholders hold our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code).
The discussion is based upon the Code, U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”) regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this report and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matter discussed herein. Prospective investors should be aware that, although we intend to adopt positions we believe are in accord with current interpretations of the U.S. federal income tax laws, the IRS may not agree with the tax positions taken by us and that, if challenged by the IRS, our tax positions might not be sustained by the courts. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate, alternative minimum, or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It also 
does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets.
For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Shareholder” generally is a beneficial owner of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation) organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision thereof;
•a trust that is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more U.S. persons or that has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or
•an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.
A “Non-U.S. Shareholder” is a beneficial owner of our common stock that is neither a U.S. Shareholder nor a partnership for U.S. tax purposes.
If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any partner of a partnership holding our common stock should consult its tax advisers with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of such shares.
Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our common stock will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation.
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
We have elected to be treated and intend to qualify each year as a RIC. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax benefits, we generally must distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”).
If we qualify as a RIC, and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we timely distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to our shareholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gain exceeds our capital loss (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (iii) certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in order to avoid imposition of this 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may not be successful in avoiding entirely the imposition of this tax. In that case, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement.
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
•continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
•derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”); and
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
•at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer 
do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
•no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the (i) securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (ii) securities, other than securities of other RICs, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received the corresponding cash amount.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds, to sell assets and to make taxable distributions of our stock and debt securities in order to satisfy the distribution requirements. Our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (i) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (ii) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation.
Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. If we are prohibited from making distributions, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation.
Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things: (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions; (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income; (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited); (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash; (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur; (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; and (vii) generate income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax decisions in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions.
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, ordinary income plus the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed our investment company taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our shareholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, a shareholder may receive a larger capital gain distribution than it would have received in the absence of such transactions.
Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty can be as high as 35% or more. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of or exemption from withholding tax on investment income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not now known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as paid by its stockholders. 
If we purchase shares in a "passive foreign investment company," or PFIC, we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any "excess distribution" or gain from the disposition of such shares. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. This additional tax and interest may apply even if we make a distribution in an amount equal to any "excess distribution" or gain from the disposition of such shares as a taxable dividend by us to our shareholders. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a "qualified electing fund" under the Code, or QEF, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to us. Alternatively, we may be able to elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in PFICs to minimize our liability for any taxes and related interest charges. 
If we hold more than 10% of the shares in a foreign corporation that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation, or “CFC,” we may be treated as receiving a deemed distribution (taxable as ordinary income) each year from such foreign corporation in an amount equal to our pro rata share of the corporation’s income for the tax year (including both ordinary earnings and capital gains), whether or not the corporation makes an actual distribution during such year. In general, a foreign corporation will be classified as a CFC if more than 50% of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, is owned (directly, indirectly or by attribution) by U.S. Shareholders. A “U.S. Shareholder,” for this purpose, is any U.S. person that possesses (actually or constructively) 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of shares of a corporation or 10% or more of the total value of all classes of shares of a corporation. If we are treated as receiving a deemed distribution from a CFC, we will be required to include such distribution in our investment company taxable income regardless of whether we receive any actual distributions from such CFC, and such income will be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax.
Foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving non-dollar debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our stockholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of "qualifying income" from which a RIC must derive at least 90% of its annual gross income. 
In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and guidance published by the IRS, a RIC that is publicly offered may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than the lesser of (a) the portion of the distribution such stockholder elected to receive in cash, or (b) an amount equal to his or her entire distribution times the percentage limitation on cash available for distribution. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or published guidance. 
If we fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and certain amelioration provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to our shareholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our shareholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, our corporate shareholders would be eligible to claim a dividend received deduction with respect to such dividend and our non-corporate shareholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as "qualified dividend income," which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder's adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. In order to requalify as a RIC, in addition to the other requirements discussed above, we would be required to distribute all of our previously undistributed earnings attributable to the period we failed to qualify as 
a RIC by the end of the first year that we intend to requalify as a RIC. If we fail to requalify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Adviser are described below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by the Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, the Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, the Adviser recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the Adviser’s investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Proxy Policies
The Adviser will seek to vote all proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interest of our shareholders. The Adviser reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by the Company. Although the Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, the Adviser may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
The Adviser’s proxy voting decisions are made by senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that the Adviser’s vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, the Adviser requires that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to the Adviser’s chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how the Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Proxy Voting Records
You may obtain information about how the Adviser voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Owl Rock Capital Corporation III, Attention: Chief Compliance Officer, 399 Park Avenue, 37th Floor, New York, NY 10022.
