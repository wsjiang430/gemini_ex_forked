ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Based in Richmond, VA, ARKO Corp. is a leading independent convenience store operator and, as of December 31, 2022, we were the sixth largest convenience store chain in the United States (“U.S.”) ranked by store count, operating 1,404 retail convenience stores. As of December 31, 2022, we operated our stores under more than 20 regional store brands that have been in existence for an average of approximately 50 years, which we consider “a Family of Community Brands.” We leverage their long-term community involvement, highly recognizable brands and customer loyalty in their respective markets. While maintaining established diversified store brands, our stores derive significant value from the scale, corporate infrastructure and centralized marketing programs associated with our large network, including a common loyalty program network which is used as a platform for promotions and marketing initiatives throughout our convenience stores. Our high value fas REWARDS® loyalty program with approximately 1.3 million members is available in the majority of our stores and offers exclusive savings on merchandise and gas to our customers.
We are also a leading wholesale distributor of motor fuel, and as of December 31, 2022, we supplied fuel to 1,674 independent dealer locations.
On July 22, 2022, we added fleet fueling to our business, which includes the operation of proprietary and third-party cardlock locations (unstaffed fueling locations), and issuance of proprietary fuel cards that provide customers access to a nationwide network of fueling sites. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 183 cardlock locations.
 We are well diversified geographically and, as of December 31, 2022, operated across 34 states and the District of Columbia in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern, Northeastern, Southeastern and Southwestern United States.
 We have achieved strong store growth over the last several years, primarily by implementing a highly successful acquisition strategy. From 2013 through 2022, we completed 22 acquisitions and our location count has grown from 320 sites in 2011 to 3,261 sites as of December 31, 2022.We believe that our acquired locations combined with our scalable infrastructure represent a strong platform for future growth within the highly fragmented convenience store industry through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. With approximately 70% of the convenience store market composed of chains with 50 or fewer locations as of December 2021, we believe that there is ample opportunity to continue to consolidate. We have traditionally acquired a majority of our stores in smaller towns with less concentration of national-chain convenience stores. Approximately 40% of all our retail stores are in cities with populations of fewer than 20,000 people. Additionally, approximately 20% of all our retail stores are in cities with populations between 20,000 and 50,000 people. We believe that our focus on secondary and tertiary markets allows us to preserve “local” brand name recognition and align local market needs with capital investment.
Corporate Information
 ARKO Corp. was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on August 26, 2020 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Haymaker Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware corporation, and ARKO Holdings Ltd., a company organized under the laws of the State of Israel, which we refer to as Arko Holdings. Our shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“common stock”), and publicly-traded warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbols “ARKO” and “ARKOW,” respectively. We own, indirectly, 100% of GPM Investments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on June 12, 2002, which we refer to as GPM, and which is our operating entity.
Our Business Segments
 Retail Segment
 Our primary business is the operation of convenience stores. As such, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from the retail sale of fuel and the products offered in our stores, resulting in our retail stores generating a large proportion of our profitability. Our retail convenience stores offer a wide array of cold and hot foodservice, beverages, cigarettes and other tobacco products, candy, salty snacks, grocery, beer and general merchandise. Almost all stores sell fuel, and we are adding electric vehicle (“EV”) chargers to select sites. Additionally, our stores offer a number of traditional convenience store services that generate additional income, including lottery, prepaid products, gift cards, money orders, ATMs, gaming, and other ancillary product and service offerings. We also generate revenues from car washes at approximately 80 of our locations.

We operate our stores under more than 20 regional store brands (which we consider “a Family of Community Brands”), including 1-Stop, Admiral, Apple Market®, BreadBox, ExpressStop®, E-Z Mart®, fas mart®, fastmarket®, Handy Mart, Jetz, Jiffi Stop®, Jiffy Stop, Li’l Cricket, Next Door Store®, Pride, Roadrunner Markets, Rstore, Scotchman®, shore stop®, Town Star, Village Pantry® and Young’s.
Our acquired brands have been in existence for an average of approximately 50 years. The advantages and significant benefits of our regional store branding while being part of a leading convenience store operator include:
•Each brand, with its own long-term community involvement, is highly recognizable to local customers;
 •Centralized merchandising, marketing and procurement programs; 
 •Fuel price optimization and purchasing functions; 
 •Comprehensive portfolio of fuel brands with strong consumer recognition through national advertising;
 •Common loyalty program under the name fas REWARDS®; 
 •Centralized environmental management and environmental practices; and 
 •Common IT and point-of-sale platforms.
 We have foodservice offerings at approximately 1,150 company-operated stores. The foodservice category varies by store and includes hot and fresh grab-n-go foods, deli, fried chicken, bakery, pizza, roller grill items and other prepared foods. In addition, at our stores we operate over 120 branded quick service restaurants consisting of major national brands. We have 18 new Sbarro, the Original New York Pizza, locations and are currently working on additional new food offerings of this kind.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the retail segment generated total revenues of approximately $5.6 billion, including approximately $1.7 billion of in-store sales and other revenues. In addition, the retail segment sold a total of more than 1.0 billion gallons of branded and unbranded fuel to its retail customers.
Wholesale Segment
 The wholesale segment supplies fuel to independent dealers, sub-wholesalers and bulk and spot purchasers, on either a cost plus or consignment basis, as described below.
•Consignment contracts — 244 sites as of December 31, 2022. In arrangements of this type, we own the fuel until the date of sale to the final customer (the consumer) and the gross profit created from the sale of the fuel is allocated between us and the independent dealer based on the terms of the relevant agreement with the independent dealer. In certain cases, gross profit is split based on a percentage and in others, we pay a fixed fee per gallon to the independent dealer.
 •Fuel supply contracts (“Cost Plus”) — 1,430 sites as of December 31, 2022 plus bulk and spot purchasers. In arrangements of this type, the independent dealer purchases the fuel from us. We make final sales to independent dealers (referred to as “lessee-dealers” if the dealers lease the station from us or “open-dealers” if they control the site), sub-wholesalers and bulk and spot purchasers on a fixed-fee basis. The sales price to the independent dealer is determined according to the terms of the relevant agreement with the independent dealer, which typically reflects our total fuel costs plus the cost of transportation and a margin, with us generally retaining any prompt pay discounts and rebates, largely eliminating our exposure to commodity price movements. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2022, the wholesale segment sold 902.6 million gallons of fuel, generating revenues of approximately $3.3 billion.
Fleet Fueling Segment
 The fleet fueling segment was added to the Company’s business on July 22, 2022 upon the closing of our acquisition from Quarles Petroleum, Incorporated (“Quarles”) of 121 proprietary Quarles-branded cardlock sites and 63 third-party cardlock sites for fleet fueling. The fleet fueling segment also includes commissions earned from the sale of fuel using proprietary fuel cards that provide customers access to a nationwide network of fueling sites. The fleet fueling business is a complementary business to our retail and wholesale segments, from which we believe we can grow and expand the Company’s fleet fueling platform. On December 6, 2022, we announced our agreement to acquire one of the largest fleet fueling operations in West Texas, which includes 57 proprietary fleet fueling cardlock sites and 52 private cardlock sites.


 As of December 31, 2022, we operated 183 cardlock locations and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the fleet fueling segment (which commenced its business on July 22, 2022) sold 60.0 million gallons of fuel, generating revenues of approximately $272.8 million in its approximately five months of operation.
GPMP Segment
 The GPMP segment engages in the wholesale distribution of fuel. Our subsidiary, GPM Petroleum LP, which we refer to as GPMP, sells and supplies fuel to substantially all of our retail and wholesale sites on a fixed margin per gallon basis and charges a fixed fee to the fleet fueling sites. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 99.9% of the total fuel gallons distributed by GPMP were to GPM sites. GPM purchases substantially all of its fuel from GPMP and we own 100% of the general partner of GPMP and, as of December 31, 2022, 99.8% of the GPMP limited partner units.
 Growth Strategy
We believe that we have a significant opportunity to increase our sales and profitability by continuing to execute our operating strategy, growing our store base in existing and contiguous markets through acquisitions, and enhancing the performance of current stores. With our achievement of significant size and scale, we believe that our organic growth strategy, including implementing company-wide marketing and merchandising initiatives, will add significant value to our assets. We believe that this complementary strategy will help further enhance our growth and results of operations. We expect to use a portion of the cash available to us to fund our growth strategy. Specific elements of our growth strategy include the following:
Pursue Acquisitions in Existing and Contiguous Markets. We have a pipeline of potential targets which we believe is highly actionable, and we currently focus on existing and contiguous markets where demographics and overall market characteristics are similar to our existing markets. We have a dedicated in-house M&A team that focuses on identifying, closing and integrating acquisitions. As an experienced acquirer, we have demonstrated the ability to generate strong returns on capital and meaningfully improve target performance post-integration through operating expertise and economies of scale. We believe that our unique business model provides us with strategic flexibility to acquire chains with retail, independent dealer and cardlock locations. We believe that continued scale advantage has enabled us to become a formidable industry player, enhanced our competitiveness, and positioned us as an acquirer of choice within the industry. As a “super-jobber” wholesaler, we believe we are better positioned to gain and renew supply contracts from independent dealers in addition to retail convenience store and wholesale fuel portfolios, and we incentivize our wholesale sales staff based on renewals. Additionally, we believe we can grow and expand the Company’s fleet fueling platform through further acquisitions, including in conjunction with our retail and wholesale acquisitions.
 Additionally, in order to improve the performance of acquired stores, as part of the post-integration process, once our systems are integrated, we implement our store planograms and merchandise assortment in the newly acquired stores and expand category footages where necessary.
Enhanced Marketing Initiatives. We plan to continue to pursue numerous in-store sales growth and margin enhancement opportunities that exist across our expansive footprint. The initiatives we are currently implementing include, among others:
•enhanced customer relationship-focused fas REWARDS® loyalty program to develop and strengthen relationships with our customers to drive more trips inside stores, including the introduction of an enhanced mobile app that has many exciting new high value features for the benefit of our approximately 1.3 million currently enrolled members and new loyalty customers;
 •expansion of core destination merchandise categories, such as candy, salty snacks and packaged beverages, using customer centric data-driven decisions; 
 •continued roll-out of functional remodels for in-store upgrades, such as bean-to-cup coffee offerings, enhanced dispensed beverage offerings and our successful grab-n-go and freezer strategy; and
 •continued expansion of the use of third-party delivery services, such as DoorDash and GrubHub, currently offered at more than 1,000 stores.
 Foodservice Opportunity. Our current foodservice offering, which varies by store, primarily consists of hot and fresh grab-n-go foods, deli, fried chicken, bakery, pizza, roller grill items and other prepared foods. We have historically relied upon a limited number of franchised quick service restaurants and in-store delis to drive customer traffic. As a result, we believe that our under-penetration of foodservice presents an opportunity to expand foodservice offerings and margin in response to changing consumer behavior. As we continue to expand our foodservice offerings and implement a variety of food options, we believe that we are making great progress identifying food concepts with a value proposition that resonates with our customers and which we can execute across our stores. In addition, we believe that continued investment in new technology platforms and applications to adapt to evolving

consumer eating preferences, including contactless checkout, order ahead service, and delivery will further drive growth in profitability. We know that we have the opportunity to significantly increase margins as we seek to continue to expand this important category to meet our customers’ needs. We believe that in our markets, we can create a value proposition to position our stores as a food destination.
Organic Growth Opportunities. We believe that we have an expansive, embedded opportunity to enhance our existing store base through several organic growth initiatives, including full and functional remodels, raze-and-rebuild and new-to-industry (“NTI”) opportunities. In 2022, we fully remodeled six stores and we commenced the planning and engineering phase of an NTI store in Atlanta, Texas with expected construction completion in 2024. We constantly monitor macroeconomic factors such as rising materials costs, shortages, construction industry price fluctuations and labor shortages and we closely analyze key performance indicators to determine our strategy.
EV Opportunity. As part of our overall EV strategy, we pursue grants and subsidies across our footprint to expand our EV charging capacity. On December 6, 2022, we completed our acquisition of all the issued and outstanding membership interests of Pride Convenience Holdings, LLC (the “Pride Acquisition”), which increased our total EV charging network by 18 chargers installed across five stores in Massachusetts, for a total of 21 charging stations installed at seven stores across three states. Prior to our acquisition, Pride was awarded a number of grants to expand their EV charging capacity in Massachusetts, which has aggressive EV targets. We plan to put these grants to use to expand EV charger availability in these markets.
We have six other active EV projects in various phases of development. We have several potential grants that we are pursuing. Our goal is to offer EV drivers the convenience and amenities they seek in a charging destination away from their homes, at areas where we identify the demand.
 Suppliers
 We purchase merchandise inventory from two primary wholesale distributors, Core-Mark and Grocery Supply Company, as well as approximately 700 direct store delivery supplier distributors. We leverage our relationships to generate economies of scale across our store base.
We purchase motor fuel primarily from large, integrated oil companies and independent refiners under supply agreements. In addition, we purchase unbranded fuel from branded and unbranded fuel suppliers to supply 266 unbranded retail fueling locations and 183 cardlock locations. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 80% of our retail fuel locations sold branded fuel. We sell branded fuel under the Valero®, Marathon®, BP®, Exxon® and Shell® brand names, plus several other brands. In addition to driving customer traffic, we believe that our branded fuel strategy enables us to maintain a secure fuel supply.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive retail convenience market, which includes businesses with operations and services that are similar to those that we provide, primarily the sale of convenience items and motor fuels. We face significant competition from other large chain operators, such as: 7-Eleven/Speedway; Circle K; Casey’s; Murphy USA; Quik Trip; Royal Farms; Sheetz; and Wawa. We believe that convenience stores managed by individual operators that offer branded or non-branded fuel are also significant competitors in the market. Often, operators of both chains and individual stores compete by selling unbranded fuel at lower retail prices relative to the market. We believe that the primary competitive factors influencing the retail segment are: site location; competitive prices; convenient access routes; the quality and configuration of the store and the fueling facility; the range of high-quality products and services offered; a convenient store-front; cleanliness; branded fuel; and the degree of capital investment in the store.
The convenience store industry is also experiencing competition from other retail sectors, including grocery stores, large warehouse retail stores, dollar stores and pharmacies. In particular, dollar stores (such as Family Dollar and Dollar General) and pharmacies (such as CVS and Walgreens) have expanded their product offerings to sell snacks, beer and wine and other products that have traditionally been sold by convenience stores, while grocery and large warehouse stores (such as Costco and Wal-Mart) have expanded their fuel offering adjacent to their stores. In smaller towns and more rural areas, we primarily compete with other local convenience stores, local or regional grocery stores, and to some extent, restaurants, and in more heavily populated areas, we often compete with local retailers as well as major national grocery chains, national drug store and warehouse retail stores brands like those mentioned above, traditional convenience stores, expanded fuel stations, and discount food retailers.
 The wholesale business is also competitive. Our wholesale segment competes with refiners that distribute their own products, as well as other independent third-party motor fuel distributors. Wholesale fuel distributors typically compete by offering shorter

contract commitments, lesser collateral requirements and larger incentives to enter into contracts. We distribute fuel sourced from a number of major oil company suppliers which allows us to approach a wide variety of branded and unbranded independent dealers in order offer a variety of alternative supply arrangements.
In the wholesale segment, we supply fuel to third parties both at sites owned or leased by the third party, sites that we own or have a long-term lease, as well as bulk and spot purchasers. In order to mitigate this competition, we typically offer the independent dealers competitive pricing within the framework of our existing fuel supply agreements, such as those we have with Valero, BP, Shell, Motiva, Marathon and ExxonMobil.
In the fleet fueling segment, we operate both third-party and proprietary cardlock sites, and market both universal and proprietary fleet cards. We market and sell to commercial and municipal entities. As opposed to retail volumes, commercial volumes have been less impacted by changing driver behavior and approximately 85% of sales are related to diesel vehicles. The primary competitors for third-party sites are companies that provide delivered fuels, with national, regional and local companies offering this service. Cardlocks compete against retail gas stations, especially those with a significant number of diesel pumps, however, we believe that our cardlock footprint allows for easier access and more efficient fueling for commercial vehicles. Third-party site growth in the fleet fueling segment is driven by commercial customers outsourcing the provision of on-site fleet fueling. We believe that we are well positioned because our third-party sites combine on-site cardlock fueling with the ability to utilize our proprietary cardlock sites and fleet card product sales.
 We accept the majority of fleet cards and retail card types at our cardlock sites, in addition to the Quarles fleet card offerings. Commercial companies using the Quarles fleet cards have gradually shifted from the proprietary fleet card useable only at Quarles-branded locations to the “Universal” fleet card which is a cobranded with Voyager (U.S. Bank) and which can be used at multiple fleet fueling sites. This is a long-term industry trend and we expect this to continue in the upcoming year. The fleet fueling business is changing with technology with a move to cardless payments and the entry of fintechs (financial technology companies) into the space. As these trends develop, we will need to align our fleet card offering to the new technologies and ensure that our cardlocks are able to accept these payment types.
We believe that the primary barriers into entry in our industry are the significant financial strength required to enter into agreements with suppliers of fuel products and competition from other fuel companies and retail chains.
Environmental and Other Government Regulations
Our operations are subject to numerous legal and regulatory restrictions and requirements at the federal, state and local levels. With regard to fuel, these restrictions and requirements relate primarily to the transportation, storage, and sale of petroleum products, including stringent environmental protection requirements. In our wholesale and GPMP segments, we are also subject to the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, which is a federal law that applies to the relationships between fuel suppliers and wholesale distributors, as well as between wholesale distributors and independent dealers, regarding the marketing of branded fuel. The law is intended to prevent the arbitrary or discriminatory cancellation, or non-renewal, of dealership agreements and stipulates limitations on the cancellation, or non-renewal, of agreements for distribution of branded fuel, unless certain conditions are satisfied.
With regard to non-fuel products, there are legal restrictions at the federal, state and local levels in connection with the sale of food, alcohol, cigarettes and other tobacco products, menu labeling, video retention, money orders, money transfer services, gaming, lottery, and ephedrine. Also, regulatory supervision is exercised by health departments at the federal, state and local levels over the food products that are sold in our stores. With respect to data held by us, including credit card information and data related to loyalty customers, we are subject to federal, state and local requirements related to the possession, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including mandated procedures to be followed in the event a data breach were to occur.
We hold various federal, state, and local licenses and permits, some of which are perpetual, but most of which must be renewed annually. These include general business licenses, lottery licenses, licenses and permits in connection with the sale of cigarettes, licenses in connection with the operation of gaming machines, licenses in connection with the sale of alcoholic drinks, licenses and permits that are required in connection with the sale of fuel, licenses that are required for the operation of convenience stores and licenses to sell food products.
EMV, which stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, is a global standard for credit cards that use computer chips to authenticate and secure chip-card transactions. The liability for fraudulent credit card transactions shifted from the credit card processor to us in October 2015 for transactions processed inside the convenience stores and shifted to us in April 2021 for transactions at the fuel dispensers.

Our operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage, overtime, working conditions and employment eligibility requirements. Proposals have emerged at local, state and federal levels to increase minimum wage rates.
We are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations that address our properties and operations, including, without limitation the transportation, storage and sale of fuel, which have a considerable impact on our operations, including compliance with the requirements and regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and comparable state counterparts. We are required to comply with the following regulations, among others:
•The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and comparable state and local laws, which imposes strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several, liability, without regard to fault, on the owner and operator as well as former owners and operators of properties where a hazardous substance has been released into the environment, including liabilities for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of contamination and any related damages to natural resources. 
 •The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) gives EPA the authority to control hazardous waste from the “cradle-to-grave”. This includes the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. RCRA also address environmental problems that could result from underground tanks storing fuel and other hazardous substances. 
 •The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state and local laws which imposes requirements on emissions to the air from motor fueling activities in certain areas of the country, including those that do not meet state or national ambient air quality standards. These laws may require the installation of vapor recovery systems to control emissions of volatile organic compounds to the air during the motor fueling process. Under the CAA and comparable state and local laws, permits are typically required to emit regulated air pollutants into the atmosphere. 
 •The federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) provides protection for the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standards require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
 The EPA, and several states, have established regulations concerning the ownership and operation of underground fuel storage tanks (“USTs”), the release of hazardous substances into the air, water and land, the storage, handling disposal and transportation of hazardous materials, restrictions on exposure to hazardous substances and maintaining safety and health of employees who handle or are exposed to such substances. These regulations require UST owners to demonstrate that they have the financial capacity to pay for environmental cleanup associating with USTs. Several states in which we conduct business have state-sponsored trust fund programs that allow for the sharing and reimbursement of the costs of corrective measures incurred by UST owners. In addition, we are subject to regulations regarding fuel quality and air emissions.
We are committed to compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We allocate a portion of our capital expenditure program to compliance with environmental laws and regulations and environmental remediation and such capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and we anticipate expenditures of approximately $5.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2023. Our environmental department maintains direct interaction with federal, state and local environmental agencies for each state in which we operate. As part of our environmental risk management process, we engage environmental consultants and service providers to assist in analyzing our exposure to environmental risks by developing remediation plans, providing other environmental services, and taking corrective actions as necessary.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 12,223 employees, with 10,934 employed in our stores and 1,289 in corporate and field management positions. As of December 31, 2022, none of our employees were represented by a labor union or have terms of employment that are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages.
We value our employees and believe that employee development and training are key elements of our effective performance. We feel that improving the skills of current staff through training increases productivity and boosts our bottom line at a fraction of the cost of hiring new employees. We offer training based on our employees’ specific job requirements and employee levels through the use of online training modules and on-the-job training conducted by store managers or our Regional Training team. Our Regional Training team conducts the Company and industry-specific training to ensure store management is well-versed in the latest operating policies, standards and techniques. Trainings vary based on employee level, but generally focus on customer service, safety, environmental issues and regulations, as well as our operations and policies. We have developed training centers for new employees at certain of our regional offices. Our experienced store managers and our corporate trainers conduct the training of store managers from

acquired sites in a classroom setting pre- and post-acquisition, as well as on-the-job training. We have also developed designated training programs for Store Manager Trainees, Assistant Managers and Food Service Managers. We have developed, and continue to refine, additional training programs for store and district managers, focusing on leadership and other “soft skills.” We help identify clear career paths to retain current employees and attract new employees by encouraging them to grow with the Company through educational training programs, matching employees with their interests or identifying a career trajectory other employees have taken.
The annual turnover rate of our store employees was approximately 213% in 2022. We seek to recruit and retain qualified personnel to work in our stores. The impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on employment trends and the prevailing wage rates in the markets in which we operate, including voluntary increases in wages because of current labor market conditions, have increased our costs associated with recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, and may continue to do so in the future.
 We seek to promote employee retention by providing attractive employee benefits, raising wages where applicable and by granting sign-on, retention, referral and other bonus opportunities to our employees based on their respective roles. By researching and understanding hiring trends, we have adopted mobile technology to simplify the application process and we have invested in additional recruiting resources and implemented virtual recruiting and interviewing methods. We have also deployed enhanced recruiting techniques to optimize the selection of our talent pool.
 Intellectual Property
We rely on trademarks that we own and trademarks we license from third parties to protect our brands and identify the source of our goods and services. We have registered or applied to register many of our trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
We also rely on trademarks that we license from third parties to identify the goods and services that we provide to our customers. We license various marks in relation to the branded fuels that we supply, including “ExxonMobil,” “Marathon,” “BP,” “Shell,” and “Valero.” In our quick service food offerings, we license trademarks such as “Subway” and “Dunkin’” to use at our applicable franchised or licensed outlets. We also license the “Jetz” trademark for use at certain of our convenience stores in Wisconsin.
We rely on other forms of intellectual property to help establish and maintain our competitive advantage, including proprietary software, trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information. We receive confidential information from our franchise and fuel supply partners, and use it in the operation of our stores under agreements that we have with our partners. We also rely on our own proprietary and confidential information, including trade secrets and a limited amount of proprietary software, to conduct our business and preserve our position in the market. As a key part of our broader risk management strategy, we use access controls and contractual restrictions in an effort to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary or confidential information.
Environmental, Social and Governance
As a leading operator of convenience stores and gas stations, we are focused on integrating Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) principles that are aligned with our long-term business strategy. We issued our inaugural ESG report in 2022, which includes our baseline governance framework, environmental initiatives and social responsibility initiatives. Our current ESG report is available on our website at www.arkocorp.com.
