--------+---------

Overview
 We are a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. Our gene therapy product candidates are designed to deliver genes to cells to address genetic defects or to enable cells in the body to produce therapeutic proteins or antibodies that are intended to impact disease. Through a single administration, our gene therapy product candidates are designed to provide long-lasting effects, potentially significantly altering the course of disease and delivering improved patient outcomes.
 Our product candidate RGX‑314 is being developed for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), a leading cause of total and partial vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan. We began enrollment in the Phase I/IIa clinical trial for RGX‑314 for the treatment of wet AMD in May 2017. Thirty total subjects have been dosed in the RGX-314 Phase I/IIa clinical trial, including six subjects in each of the first three dose cohorts and 12 subjects in the fourth dose cohort. We previously reported that as of December 3, 2018:
  
• | RGX-314 had been well-tolerated across all cohorts, with no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. The most common adverse events (AEs) had been assessed as mild and there had been no observed immune responses, drug-related ocular inflammation or post-surgical inflammation beyond what is expected following a routine vitrectomy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 50% of subjects (3 of 6) in the third dose cohort remained anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) rescue injection-free at nine months with persistent clinical durability of effect observed in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT). Mean BCVA improved by +13 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters and mean CRT decreased by -37 microns from baseline in these subjects at nine months.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect to expand to a fifth dose cohort in the RGX-314 Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of wet AMD over the course of 2019. We also expect to present top-line data from the Phase I/IIa clinical trial in wet AMD and initiate a Phase IIb clinical trial in wet AMD by the end of 2019. We expect to file an investigational new drug application (IND) for a Phase II clinical trial for RGX-314 in an additional chronic retinal condition where anti-VEGF therapy is the current standard of care in the second half of 2019.
 We are also developing product candidates to address the neurological symptoms of three severe genetic lysosomal storage diseases: Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II), Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) and late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type II (CLN2 disease). MPS II is caused by deficiency of iduronate‑2‑sulfatase (IDS), MPS I is caused by deficiency of α-l-iduronidase (IDUA) and CLN2 disease is caused by deficiency of tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), all of which are enzymes that are responsible for breakdown of cellular waste products. Patients with severe forms of these diseases exhibit significant cognitive decline. Our product candidates for these diseases are:
  
• | RGX-121 for the treatment of MPS II. The first subject in the RGX-121 Phase I/II clinical trial was dosed in late 2018. As of December 4, 2018, the subject had completed an initial eight-week safety assessment, and RGX-121 had been well-tolerated with no SAEs reported.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RGX-111 for the treatment of MPS I. The IND for RGX‑111 is active. We expect to begin enrollment in a Phase I clinical trial for RGX‑111 in mid‑2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RGX-181 for the treatment of CLN2 disease. We expect to file an IND for RGX-181 in the second half of 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our product candidate RGX‑501 is for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a severe genetic disease characterized by premature and aggressive plaque buildup, life threatening coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic valve disease predominantly due to abnormalities in the function or expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. We began enrollment in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX‑501 in March 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we had dosed three subjects in the first cohort and three subjects in the second cohort of the RGX-501 Phase I/II clinical trial. An amendment to the Phase I/II clinical trial protocol has been submitted to health authorities to allow for the enrollment of additional subjects at the second cohort dose using corticosteroid prophylaxis. We expect to present interim data from second dose cohort with steroid prophylaxis from the Phase I/II clinical trial in the second half of 2019. 
 In addition to the lead product candidates described above, we have also funded, and plan to continue to fund, preclinical research on potential product candidate programs that may become part of our internal product development pipeline. We have partnered with leading academic institutions and will continue to seek partnerships with innovative institutions to develop novel NAV gene therapy product candidates.

Our gene therapy product candidates deliver genes to cells using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, which are non-replicating viral delivery vehicles that are not known to cause disease. Our product candidates all utilize viral vectors from our proprietary gene delivery platform, which we call our NAV Technology Platform. Our NAV Technology Platform consists of exclusive rights to AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAVrh10 and over 100 other novel AAV vectors (NAV Vectors). We currently have exclusive rights to over 100 patents and patent applications worldwide covering our NAV Vectors, including composition of matter claims for AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10, as well as methods for their manufacture and therapeutic uses. We believe this patent portfolio forms a strong foundation for our current programs and with our ongoing research and development, we expect to continue to expand this robust patent portfolio.
 The foundation of our NAV Technology Platform was discovered in an effort to identify next generation AAV vectors that could overcome the limitations of earlier generation AAV vectors (AAV1 through AAV6). We believe the key benefits of NAV Vectors over earlier generation AAV vectors include:
  
• | higher gene expression;
--+------------------------


• | longer-term gene expression;
--+-----------------------------


• | broad and novel tissue selectivity;
--+------------------------------------


• | lower immune response; and
--+---------------------------


• | improved manufacturability.
--+----------------------------

 In addition to our internal product development efforts, we also selectively sublicense our NAV Vectors to other biotechnology companies, which we refer to as NAV Technology Licensees. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by our NAV Technology Licensees.

Our internal and partnered product development program pipeline is shown below.

Our partnered development pipeline benefits from the disease-specific expertise of our NAV Technology Licensees. Our partnering strategy provides us the flexibility to sublicense development of treatments designed to address significant unmet medical needs, while remaining focused on our core programs and therapeutic areas internally. We believe that the broad applicability of our NAV Technology Platform and any clinical successes of the treatments utilizing NAV Vectors will create new internal and partnered pipeline opportunities.
 Our management team includes leaders who are experienced in building and operating innovative healthcare ventures and have expert knowledge in the development of AAV gene therapy, as well as in the disease areas we seek to address. We believe the strength of our team positions us to succeed in developing and bringing to market, independently or with our development partners, unique, best-in-class gene therapy treatments for a range of severe diseases with significant unmet medical needs.
 Our Strategy
 Our mission is to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. We are seeking to develop, manufacture, commercialize and license product candidates across multiple therapeutic areas and target organs while continuing to expand our NAV Technology Platform. To achieve our mission, we are pursuing the following strategies:

• | Apply our proprietary, next generation AAV vector technology to develop in vivo gene therapies for patients. We believe in vivo gene therapy is an ideal treatment paradigm for monogenic diseases with sub-optimal or non-existent therapies because of its potential to correct an underlying genetic defect, rather than just treating a patient’s symptoms. In diseases not caused by a single gene defect, in vivo gene therapy has the potential to replace the need for frequent treatments by enabling the body to produce therapeutic proteins or antibodies consistently to impact the course of disease. We believe our NAV Technology Platform is proving to be a significant advancement over earlier AAV vectors in delivering these therapies. Based on data derived from our clinical studies and animal models using our NAV Vectors, as well as third-party clinical trials and animal models using our NAV Vectors, we believe our NAV Technology Platform possesses unique, beneficial properties that are not seen in earlier generation AAVs. We believe that our NAV Technology Platform, which underpins our internal development programs and the programs of our NAV Technology Licensees, will enable us and our partners to develop best-in-class gene therapy candidates for a wide range of disease targets.

• | Rapidly advance our RGX-314 program for wet AMD and other chronic retinal conditions that respond to anti-VEGF therapy. Wet AMD and several other chronic retinal conditions are currently treated with frequent intraocular injections of anti-VEGF therapy. We believe our RGX-314 product candidate has the potential to provide long-term anti-VEGF therapy for patients via a single administration, relieving significant treatment burden for patients, physicians and caregivers, while potentially improving patient outcomes by providing consistent, sustained levels of anti-VEGF in the eye. We are conducting a Phase I/IIa clinical trial for RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD and plan to expand to a larger, randomized, controlled Phase IIb clinical trial for wet AMD in late 2019. In addition, we plan to expand to additional chronic retinal conditions that respond to anti-VEGF therapy. We plan to file the first IND for an additional Phase II clinical trial in a condition beyond wet AMD in the second half of 2019. If we are successful in further establishing safety and efficacy in these Phase II clinical trials, we will pursue further development, including registration trials and commercialization of such product candidates
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aggressively progress our internal lead proprietary development programs in neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. MPS II, MPS I, CLN2 disease and HoFH are all diseases with high unmet clinical need and current treatments that are sub-optimal. Our neurodegenerative disease franchise leverages a platform approach by using our NAV AAV9 vector and an intracisternal route of administration across our three neurodegenerative disease programs. The first subject was dosed in 2018 in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX‑121 for the treatment of MPS II and we expect to continue enrollment in the RGX-121 clinical trial throughout 2019. The IND for RGX‑111 for the treatment of MPS I is active and we expect to initiate a Phase I clinical trial for RGX‑111 in mid‑2019. We are progressing preclinical studies for RGX-181 for the treatment of CLN2 disease and we plan to file an IND in the second half of 2019. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, we had enrolled six subjects in a Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX‑501 and we expect to present interim data from the Phase I/II clinical trial in the second half of 2019 on additional subjects in the second dose cohort treated with steroid prophylaxis. If we are successful in achieving proof-of-concept in the Phase I or Phase I/II clinical trials for these neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, we will pursue further development, including registration trials and commercialization of such product candidates.

• | Establish gene therapy franchises in and beyond our current core therapeutic areas of retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. After human proof-of-concept is achieved in a disease, we believe we will be able to apply what we have learned and use our NAV Technology Platform to more rapidly develop new product candidates for many similar diseases. Once an appropriate vector and route of administration for a particular disease type have been established, we believe a new gene can be inserted into the appropriate vector and the established route of administration can be used for other similar diseases. To date, our strategy of focusing on retinal, neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases has been informed by significant animal, and in some cases human clinical, data that indicate specific NAV Vectors are particularly effective in the cells where these types of diseases manifest. Targeting tissues where diseases manifest is critical to impacting the course of diseases with our NAV gene therapy treatments (NAV Gene Therapy). This approach underpins our strategy for our neurodegenerative disease franchise, where we applied knowledge from the IND-enabling studies for RGX‑111 for MPS I to enable a rapid follow-on IND filing for RGX‑121, our MPS II program, and we continue to apply these learnings as we progress our RGX-181 program for CLN2 disease. We believe that this approach is also applicable to retinal and metabolic diseases, as well as many other therapeutic areas and tissue targets, such as the muscle, and will allow us to efficiently generate product candidates for diseases in and beyond our current areas of therapeutic focus.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the NAV Technology Platform in the expression of therapeutic proteins, antibodies and gene editing. Our treatment for wet AMD involves the novel, one-time administration of our NAV AAV8 vector encoding a gene for a monoclonal antibody fragment, which has the potential to enable a subject’s retinal cells to continuously produce therapeutic antibodies. To maintain efficacy, the current standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD requires repetitive and inconvenient intraocular injections of marketed therapeutic proteins or antibodies, typically ranging from every four to eight weeks in frequency. There are many diseases where the existing standard of care involves frequent administration of marketed therapeutic proteins or antibodies and we believe there are other patient populations that would benefit from NAV-based treatments designed to enable different cells in the body of patients to produce therapeutic proteins or antibodies. In addition, it has been demonstrated by several researchers that our NAV Technology Platform can be efficiently adapted to deliver different genome editing components to address the specific treatment needs of many disease targets. We may aim to invest in research and development in these areas or explore collaborations with strategic partners that have capabilities in the development of therapeutic antibodies, proteins and gene editing.

• | Further grow the potential of our NAV Technology Platform through strategic in-licensing and sublicensing of new programs. We plan to grow the potential of our NAV Technology Platform through licensing. For example, we pursue in-licensing for programs we deem to be promising research programs using our NAV Vectors from time to time. We intend to continue to selectively sublicense our NAV Technology Platform for specific vector and indication combinations to additional NAV Technology Licensees. Strategic sublicensing allows us to maintain our internal product development focus in our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV Gene Therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform, and creating potential additional revenue.

• | Maintain and grow our extensive intellectual property portfolio. We plan to leverage our intellectual property rights and substantial expertise in AAV gene therapy in order to develop and commercialize NAV Gene Therapy. We have licensed exclusive rights to a broad portfolio of certain fundamental AAV gene therapy patents and patent applications. In securing these rights, we have focused on obtaining robust rights for those intellectual property assets we believe will be most important in providing us with a competitive advantage with respect to AAV gene therapy treatments. We plan to continue to seek to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.

The Broad Potential and Application of Gene Therapy
 The concept of developing human therapies involving the delivery of external genes has existed for decades, driven by the arrival of recombinant technology and the early demonstrations by scientists of the ability to deliver and drive expression of external gene sequences in mammalian cells.
 7



We believe that gene therapy has the potential to become a new and important class of treatment because it may offer the following benefits:
  
• | Ability to treat a broad range of diseases. Given the availability of the sequence of the entire human genome, it could be possible to design gene therapy to express or effect expression of any human protein whose presence, absence or activity causes disease. We believe gene therapy treatments can also be designed to enable the body to continuously produce therapeutic proteins or antibodies or be efficiently adapted to deliver different genome editing components to address the specific treatment needs of many disease targets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to target mechanisms that cannot be targeted effectively by existing drug classes. Many proteins that play roles in disease cannot be targeted effectively with small molecules and therapeutic proteins. These limitations on small molecule and protein drugs may not apply to gene therapy, which we believe can be designed to target any gene in the genome.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to create convenient treatment profiles. Because gene therapies are designed to deliver a long-term effect with a single administration, a single gene delivered via gene therapy could potentially do the same work as administering conventional drugs over the course of many years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simplified discovery of treatment candidates. Identification of small molecule and protein drug candidates typically requires screening of a large number of potential candidates to find prospective leads. Identification of gene therapy candidates has the potential to be simpler and take considerably less time because it can involve relatively standard processes that can be applied in a similar fashion to many successive product candidates.

 RGX‑314 for the Treatment of Wet AMD
 We are developing RGX‑314 for the treatment of wet AMD. Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to excess fluid accumulation from new blood vessel formation. Fluid leakage following this excess fluid accumulation can result in physical changes in the structure of the retina and adverse changes in vision. As this process progresses, blindness can result from atrophy and scar formation. Wet AMD is a leading cause of total and partial vision loss in the United States, Europe and Japan. As indicated by the name, the risk for developing wet AMD increases with age and we anticipate the diagnosis rate will continue to increase as the population continues to trend towards an aging population. 
 Anti-VEGF therapies are the standard of care in wet AMD due to their ability to reduce fluid accumulation and, on average, improve vision in the majority of patients with wet AMD. Currently, there are three anti-VEGFs that are commonly used for the treatment of wet AMD. All of these therapies, however, require repetitive and inconvenient intraocular injections, typically ranging from every four to eight weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Patients often experience vision loss with reduced frequency of treatment and due to a variety of factors, including inconvenience and discomfort associated with frequent injections in the eye, patient compliance is a significant concern with anti-VEGF therapies.
 RGX‑314 is being developed as a novel, one-time subretinal treatment for wet AMD that consists of the NAV AAV8 vector encoding a gene for a monoclonal antibody fragment. The expressed protein is designed to neutralize VEGF activity, modifying the pathway for formation of new leaky blood vessels and retinal fluid accumulation. After delivery of RGX‑314, we believe retinal cells will continue to produce the anti-VEGF protein. 
 Clinical Development of RGX‑314 for the Treatment of Wet AMD
 Enrollment in the Phase I/IIa clinical trial of subretinally administered RGX‑314 in the United States in subjects with wet AMD began in May 2017. The trial design allows for enrollment of up to 42 subjects across five dose levels.  Subjects enrolled in the clinical trial must have a documented need and history of response to anti-VEGF therapies. Primary endpoints include AEs, certain laboratory measures (including immunological parameters), evaluation of BCVA, change in CRT as measured by spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT), presence of RGX‑314 protein in aqueous fluid and other outcome measures. The primary purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RGX‑314 at 24 weeks after a single dose of RGX‑314 administered by subretinal delivery. Following completion of the primary study period, it is expected that subjects will enter the follow-up period and will continue to be assessed for long-term safety and durability of effect until week 106.

In August 2018, we announced positive interim safety and efficacy data from the RGX-314 Phase I/IIa clinical trial in wet AMD. As of July 27, 2018, RGX-314 was well-tolerated by all subjects with no reported drug-related AEs or SAEs. There had been no observed immune responses, drug-related ocular inflammation or any post-surgical inflammation beyond what is expected following routine vitrectomy. Dose-dependent protein expression levels as measured from aqueous samples by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECL), dose-dependent reduction in anti-VEGF injections and maintenance of CRT measured by SD-OCT had been reported across all cohorts. Additionally, through month six, BCVA assessments for subjects in the third dose cohort had a mean improvement in visual acuity of eight ETDRS letters. As of July 27, 2018, 50% of subjects (three subjects) from the third dose cohort were free of anti-VEGF injections for six months since the administration of RGX-314. 
 In October 2018, we provided an update on RGX-314 protein expression levels in the third dose cohort six months after administration of RGX-314. At six months post RGX-314 administration, mean and median RGX-314 protein levels measured from aqueous samples by ECL in the third dose cohort were higher than at one month post RGX-314 administration. Mean and median protein expression levels in the third dose cohort were higher both in the group of subjects who had been free of anti-VEGF injections since the administration of RGX-314 and those who had received anti-VEGF rescue injections. 
 In January 2019, we provided an additional update on the RGX-314 Phase I/IIa clinical trial. As of December 3, 2018, RGX-314 continued to be well-tolerated across all cohorts, with no drug-related SAEs and no observed immune responses, drug-related ocular inflammation or post-surgical inflammation beyond what is expected following a routine vitrectomy. 50% of subjects (3 of 6) in the third dose cohort continued to remain anti-VEGF rescue injection-free at nine months post-RGX-314 administration with persistent clinical durability of effect observed on BCVA and CRT. Mean BCVA improved by +13 ETDRS letters and mean CRT decreased by -37 microns from baseline in these subjects at nine months. 
 30 total subjects have been dosed in the RGX-314 Phase I/IIa clinical trial, including six subjects in each of the first three dose cohorts and 12 subjects in the fourth dose cohort.
 We expect to present top-line data from the RGX‑314 Phase I/IIa clinical trial by the end of 2019, and initiate a larger, randomized, controlled Phase IIb clinical trial for RGX-314 in wet AMD in late 2019.
 RGX-314 for the Treatment of Additional Retinal Conditions
 Anti-VEGF therapy is the standard of care in several chronic retinal conditions beyond wet AMD, including but not limited to diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion. While these and other chronic retinal conditions respond to anti-VEGF therapy, we believe these patient populations could benefit from an improved, long-term anti-VEGF treatment solution that RGX-314 may be able to provide. We plan to file INDs and conduct clinical trials for RGX-314 in additional chronic retinal conditions in the future, including to further evaluate the potential benefit of RGX-314 as a one-time anti-VEGF treatment in an additional chronic retinal condition in the second half of 2019.
 RGX‑121 for the Treatment of MPS II
 RGX‑121 is our product candidate for the treatment of MPS II. MPS II, also known as Hunter syndrome, is a rare, X-linked recessive, or sex-linked, disease caused by a deficiency of IDS. IDS is an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of polysaccharides heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in the lysosomes of cells, which are intracellular structures that dispose of waste products inside cells. These polysaccharides, called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), accumulate in tissues of MPS II patients, resulting in diverse clinical signs and symptoms. Many patients develop symptoms related to GAG storage in the central nervous system (CNS), which can include excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain, spinal cord compression and cognitive impairment. In severe forms of the disease, early developmental milestones may be met during the first year after birth, but developmental delay is readily apparent by 18 to 24 months. Developmental progression begins to plateau between three and five years of age, with regression reported to begin around six and a half years. By the time of death, most patients with CNS involvement are severely mentally handicapped and require constant care.
 MPS II is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 170,000 births worldwide. Based on global population, this equates to approximately 500 to 1,000 MPS II patients born each year worldwide.
 In 2006, recombinant IDS (Elaprase), an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), was approved by the FDA for the treatment of MPS II and has subsequently been approved for use internationally. However, ERT does not treat CNS manifestations of MPS II since the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Specific treatment to address the neurological manifestations of MPS II and prevent or stabilize cognitive decline remains a significant unmet medical need. Overall, the limitations of ERT leave a significant unmet need for a method to safely achieve long-term IDS reconstitution in the CNS for MPS II patients experiencing neurological complications.

RGX‑121 is designed to use the AAV9 vector to deliver the human IDS gene to the CNS. Delivery and expression of the enzyme that is deficient within cells in the CNS could provide a permanent source of secreted IDS on the CNS side of the blood-brain barrier, allowing for long-term cross-correction of cells throughout the CNS. We believe this strategy could provide rapid IDS delivery to the brain, potentially preventing the progression of cognitive deficits that otherwise occur in MPS II patients.
 We have received orphan drug product designation, rare pediatric disease designation and fast track designation from the FDA for RGX‑121.
 Clinical Development of RGX‑121 for the Treatment of MPS II
 Enrollment in the Phase I/II clinical trial of RGX‑121 based gene delivery via CNS administration in subjects with MPS II began in the second half of 2018. The trial design calls for enrollment of up to six subjects with MPS II. Subjects in the study must be greater than or equal to four months of age and less than five years of age. All subjects must have documented evidence of neurocognitive deficits due to MPS II or have a relative diagnosed with severe MPS II who has the same IDS mutation as the subject. The primary endpoint will be a safety assessment. The secondary and exploratory endpoints include the effect of RGX‑121 on biomarkers of IDS activity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and urine and effect of RGX‑121 on neurocognitive deficits, as well as other outcome measures.
 We expect to provide an interim data update from the RGX-121 Phase I/II clinical trial in the second half of 2019.
 RGX‑111 for the Treatment of MPS I
 We are developing RGX-111 for the treatment of MPS I. MPS I is a rare autosomal recessive, or non-sex-linked, genetic disease caused by deficiency of IDUA, an enzyme required for the breakdown of polysaccharides heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in lysosomes. Similar to MPS II, many MPS I patients develop symptoms related to GAG storage in the CNS, which can include excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain, spinal cord compression and cognitive impairment. MPS I patients span a broad spectrum of disease severity and extent of CNS involvement. The severe form of MPS I is also referred to as Hurler syndrome. Hurler patients have two mutations in the IDUA gene, resulting in no active enzyme. These patients typically present with symptoms before two years of age and universally exhibit severe cognitive decline after an initial period of normal development. 
 MPS I is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 100,000 births worldwide. Based on global population, this equates to over 1,000 MPS I patients born each year worldwide. Studies suggest that severe forms of MPS I represent between one-half and two-thirds of all MPS I patients.
 The current standard of care for patients with an attenuated form of MPS I is a recombinant form of human IDUA (Aldurazyme). Given as a weekly intravenous infusion, this ERT has demonstrated improvement in hepatosplenomegaly, growth, mobility and respiratory function. However, as the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, ERT does not treat the CNS manifestations of MPS I.
 The first disease modifying therapy developed for severe MPS I was bone marrow transplant (BMT). Though BMT has demonstrated improvements in survival, growth, cardiac and respiratory function, mobility and intellect, it is also associated with clinically relevant morbidity and an estimated 10% to 20% mortality. Accordingly, the procedure is reserved for patients with severe disease before two years of age because the risk-benefit ratio is thought to be more favorable in younger patients who have not yet experienced advanced cognitive decline. Another critical limitation of BMT is that cognitive decline continues for up to a year after transplant before stabilizing, leaving permanent cognitive deficits. In addition, clinical trials to evaluate direct administration of ERT into the CNS for the treatment of MPS II and CLN2 disease have been initiated in an effort to find approaches that treat the CNS manifestations of lysosomal storage diseases. These approaches, however, do not address the underlying cause of these neurodegenerative diseases and we believe that if such products receive regulatory approval, the need for frequent (bi-weekly or monthly) administration into the CNS is likely to lead to patient compliance issues, further reducing the treatment potential of this method of ERT.
 Overall, the limitations of BMT and ERT leave a significant unmet need for a method to safely achieve long-term IDUA reconstitution in the CNS for MPS I patients experiencing neurological complications.
 RGX‑111 is designed to use the AAV9 vector to deliver the human IDUA gene to the CNS. Delivery of the enzyme that is deficient within cells in the CNS could provide a permanent source of secreted IDUA beyond the blood-brain barrier, allowing for long-term cross-correction of cells throughout the CNS. We believe this strategy could also provide rapid IDUA delivery to the brain, potentially preventing the progression of cognitive deficits that otherwise occurs in MPS I patients.

We have received orphan drug product designation, rare pediatric disease designation and fast track designation from the FDA for RGX‑111.
 Planned Clinical Development of RGX‑111 for the Treatment of MPS I
 The IND for RGX‑111 is active and we plan to initiate a Phase I clinical trial of RGX‑111 based gene delivery via CNS administration in mid‑2019 in subjects with MPS I. The primary endpoint will be a safety assessment. The secondary endpoints include the effect of RGX‑111 on biomarkers of IDUA activity in the CSF, serum and urine and the effect of RGX‑111 on neurocognitive deficits, as well as other outcome measures.
 We expect to begin enrollment in the RGX-111 Phase I clinical trial in mid-2019.
 RGX‑181 for the Treatment of CLN2 Disease
 RGX‑181 is our product candidate for the treatment of CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease. CLN2 disease is a rare, pediatric-onset, autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the TPP1 gene. Mutations in the TPP1 gene, and subsequent deficiency in TPP1 enzymatic activity, result in lysosomal accumulation of storage material and degeneration of tissues including the brain and retina. CLN2 disease is characterized by seizures, rapid deterioration of language and motor functions, cognitive decline, loss of vision and blindness, and premature death by mid-childhood. Onset of symptoms is generally between two to four years of age with initial features of recurrent seizures (epilepsy), language delay, and difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). 
 CLN2 disease is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 250,000 births worldwide. Based on global population, this equates to as many as 500 patients born each year worldwide.
 There is currently no cure for CLN2 disease. Current treatment options include palliative care or ERT. In 2017, recombinant TPP1 (Brineura), an ERT, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of CLN2 disease. Brineura is administered into the lateral ventricles via an implanted device on a biweekly basis. While an improvement over palliative care in slowing disease progression, we believe frequent administration of ERT into the CNS, reliance on limited and specialized infusion centers, the need for and complications associated with a permanently implanted device, and lack of a treatment for the underlying genetic cause of CLN2 disease represents an area of significant unmet medical need.  
 RGX‑181 is designed to use the AAV9 vector to deliver the human TPP1 gene to the CNS. Delivery of the gene that is deficient within cells in the CNS could provide a permanent source of secreted TPP1, allowing for long-term cross-correction of cells throughout the CNS.
 We have received orphan drug product designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for RGX‑181.
 Planned Clinical Development of RGX‑181 for the Treatment of CLN2 Disease
 We intend to file an IND in the second half of 2019 to support the initiation of a dose-escalation clinical trial of RGX-181 based gene delivery via CNS administration in subjects with CLN2 disease. Potential endpoints include a safety assessment, evaluation of biomarkers and clinical outcomes.
 RGX‑501 for the Treatment of HoFH
 We are developing RGX-501 for the treatment of HoFH. HoFH is a monogenic disorder caused predominantly by abnormalities in the function or expression of the LDLR gene. LDLR plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol by facilitating uptake and degradation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the liver. HoFH patients have very low levels or are completely deficient of LDLR, resulting in very high blood cholesterol levels which are typically greater than 500 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Patients with HoFH develop progressive atherosclerosis, or narrowing and blockage of the arteries beginning at an early age, which leads to a high incidence of heart attacks in children and teenagers, among other severe symptoms. If untreated, HoFH patients usually die of causes related to CAD or aortic valve disease before the age of 30.
 11



Published medical literature suggests that the worldwide prevalence of HoFH is estimated to be as high as 1 in 200,000. Based on disease severity and molecular characteristics, we estimate there are approximately 11,000 individuals globally who are primary candidates for gene therapy treatment of HoFH. Multiple studies have compared HoFH patients based on LDLR activity and have shown that small differences in residual activity can lead to significant reductions in cholesterol levels and better long-term outcomes.
 Available treatment options for HoFH are limited. Lipoprotein apheresis, a physical method of filtering the plasma of LDL-C, is laborious and requires frequent intravenous access that can be challenging, expensive and not readily available. Other available treatments include statins, a class of pharmaceuticals commonly used to lower cholesterol levels, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and other cholesterol lowering medications. The FDA has approved two drugs as add-on therapy specifically for HoFH: lomitapide and mipomersen. Both result in a reduction of LDL-C, but their use is associated with an array of adverse events that may affect tolerance and long-term adherence. Other available treatments include PCSK9 inhibitors, which are designed to increase LDLR on the surface of the liver by reducing LDLR clearance by the PCSK9 protein. Effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors relies on patients having functional LDLR, so we believe a substantial unmet medical need remains for the population of HoFH patients who are LDLR negative or severely deficient in LDLR function. With all current HoFH therapies, even in combination, providing sub-optimal treatment for patients, a better solution is needed. 
 RGX‑501 is designed to use the AAV8 vector to deliver the human LDLR gene to liver cells. We believe that the liver is the preferred target organ for gene therapy of HoFH since LDLRs produced in the liver contribute to greater than 90% of the capture and breakdown of LDL, making the liver by far the most important LDLR producing organ. Additionally, the liver is also the only organ capable of excreting cholesterol from the body, a function that is critical to the maintenance of cholesterol balance. Finally, studies have shown that liver transplantation in HoFH patients corrects the disease, providing strong support that correction of hepatic LDL receptor activity by gene therapy is sufficient for metabolic correction of the disease.
 We have received orphan drug product designation from the FDA for RGX‑501.
 Clinical Development of RGX‑501 for the Treatment of HoFH
 Enrollment in the Phase I/II clinical trial of intravenously administered RGX‑501 in the United States in subjects with HoFH began in March 2017. The primary endpoint is a safety assessment. The secondary endpoints are reduction in LDL-C and other outcome measures. Based on previous clinical trials and recent approvals in HoFH, we believe reduction in LDL-C is an endpoint that is an acceptable measure on which regulatory approval could be based.
 As of December 31, 2018, a total of six subjects had been enrolled in two dose cohorts of the Phase I/II trial for RGX-501 for the treatment of HoFH. Four SAEs had been reported, two of which were reported as drug-related. All three subjects enrolled at the dose of 7.5 x 10^12 GC/kg body weight (Cohort 2) experienced elevation in transaminases four to six weeks post-dosing, were asymptomatic and responded rapidly to the initiation of corticosteroids followed by a slow taper, with normalization of the transaminases. At 12 weeks, the three subjects in the first dose cohort did not show a clinically meaningful change in LDL-C levels. We believe that the ability to assess LDL-C levels at 12 weeks in the three subjects in the second dose cohort may be confounded by the potential effects on the liver and the resulting steroid therapy.
 In November 2018, we entered into a new clinical trial agreement with the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the original RGX-501 trial sponsor, which allowed us to become the trial sponsor following the required activities with regulatory authorities to effectuate the transfer of sponsorship. We believe this will allow for enhanced visibility and control over the RGX-501 trial. In the United States, the RGX-501 IND application was transferred in November 2018. Transfer of the Clinical Trial Applications for all other participating countries was ongoing.   
 In parallel, an amendment to the Phase I/II clinical trial protocol has been submitted to health authorities to allow for the enrollment of additional subjects at the second dose cohort dose level using corticosteroid prophylaxis. Trial recruitment has resumed. While we have assumed sponsor responsibilities, Penn will continue to support this study both as a scientific collaborator and as the principal dosing site. 
 We expect to provide an interim data update from the second dose cohort with steroid prophylaxis from the RGX-501 Phase I/II clinical trial in the second half of 2019.

Other Preclinical Programs
 In addition to our lead product candidate programs, we have also funded, and plan to continue to fund, preclinical research on potential product candidate programs that may become part of our internal product development pipeline in and beyond our current retina, neurodegenerative and metabolic franchise areas. We have partnered with a number of leading academic institutions and will continue to seek partnerships with innovative institutions to remain at the leading edge of the gene therapy field.
Commercial Licenses to NAV Technology Licensees
 We sublicense our NAV Technology Platform to third parties in order to develop and bring to market NAV Gene Therapy for a range of severe diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Sublicensing allows us to maintain our internal product development focus on our core disease indications and therapeutic areas while still expanding the NAV Gene Therapy pipeline, developing a greater breadth of treatments for patients, providing additional technological and potential clinical proof-of-concept for our NAV Technology Platform, and creating potential additional revenue.
 Each sublicense specifies the vector or vectors and disease indication or indications as well as whether the sublicense is exclusive or non-exclusive. In determining whether to sublicense, we first evaluate whether the disease indication is of interest to us in which case we may develop a therapeutic for the disease indication internally using our NAV Technology Platform. If it is not, we consider the size of the potential market and unmet need, competition, licensee development history and capabilities and licensee’s ability to pay in evaluating whether to enter into a license agreement. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by 11 NAV Technology Licensees, most under a license to specific NAV Vectors for specific indications.
 Our license agreements include upfront and annual fees, milestone fees based on licensee candidate progression, and low-single to low-double digit royalties on sales. Such royalties are subject to customary reductions, such as if the licensee must obtain a license from a third party to avoid infringement of such third party’s rights in order to exercise its rights under the license granted by us. We are obligated to make payments to our licensors with respect to the revenues we receive from our licensees for these sublicenses in accordance with the terms of our agreements with our licensors. As of December 31, 2018, our NAV Technology Licensees had 13 clinical stage programs using NAV Vectors. 
 Process Development and Manufacturing
 We believe that we have the internal capabilities and access to the resources necessary to enable us to successfully commercialize NAV Gene Therapy products following regulatory approval, if any, by developing scalable processes to manufacture such products efficiently and at commercial quantity.
AAV Vector Production
 We have invested significantly in our internal capabilities and infrastructure, including the establishment of our advanced manufacturing and analytics lab, which has been recently expanded to also accommodate a larger, 200 liter scale of operation and to support our emerging research activities. Our internal team possesses deep knowledge of AAV characterization and production, as well as significant experience and expertise in biologics process development (upstream, purification and formulation), scale-up and production at large scale. We believe our capabilities and infrastructure will enable us to continue to be leaders in development of scalable, proprietary production methods for NAV Gene Therapy products. We have established internal capability to produce NAV Vectors across multiple platforms and at a scale of up to 200 liters.
 We have also entered into agreements with multiple leading biologics contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for production of material under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements to support our current and future clinical trials, as well as potential future commercialization of our product development programs. We select our CMOs based on capability, capacity and expertise, and we believe our CMOs are capable of meeting global regulatory standards for clinical and commercial material supply. We believe partnering with multiple leading CMOs provides us with flexibility and diversity in suppliers, as well as access to potential future capacity to accommodate the scale that may be required for future clinical trials and commercialization.
 13



In 2018, we entered into a strategic partnership with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies (FUJIFILM) for the manufacture of our lead product candidates, which will support late-stage clinical development and early commercialization. Under the terms of the agreement with FUJIFILM, we gain guaranteed capacity for the supply of NAV AAV drug substance manufactured under cGMP at large scale—up to 2,000 liters—for three years, with the option to extend the agreement for an additional three years. We believe FUJIFILM facilities are compliant with global regulatory standards in support of the initiation of worldwide clinical trials for our lead product candidates.
 In addition, we believe we have established a robust supply chain for our key raw materials to ensure both high quality standards and assurance of raw material supply as we advance our programs. We have established dual supply sources for critical raw materials to minimize the potential for disruption of ongoing manufacturing activities. We believe our management team retains significant expertise in managing a diverse network of CMOs and suppliers and that this expertise will enable us to execute on our manufacturing strategy in connection with our external partners.
 Proprietary Methods
 We have obtained rights to all of the proprietary technology underlying our NAV Technology Platform through our Platform Licenses (described below) and our sponsored research agreements (SRAs), under which we have exclusively licensed rights to certain manufacturing-related patents and non-exclusively licensed rights to certain know-how owned or developed by Penn. This intellectual property encompasses areas including scalable AAV production methods, methods of increasing the packaging yield of AAV and methods of purification of AAV vectors.
 We have examined several methods of larger-scale manufacturing of AAV which have been optimized to yield high titer and quality vectors. However, further improvements to the efficiency and simplicity of the process may remain important to address future needs for commercial applications. Our production methods utilize linearly scalable unit operations which produce robust yield and purity of the target vector.
 Scientists at Penn discovered that in contrast to earlier generation AAV2, most NAV Vectors were released primarily into the medium of production cultures and not retained in the cell. Because these vectors are secreted directly into the media, we are able to efficiently deliver a product of high purity and with relatively high yield with less need for complicated purification steps. This method, for which we have licensed from Penn the exclusive patent rights, is high-yielding and versatile for the production of different NAV Vectors and has been demonstrated to scale into a cGMP setting with comparable yields and product quality. Our future process development activities will build upon this platform to target higher yield of vector without impacting the product purity profile.
 Other Capabilities
 We have prepared and characterized several proprietary HEK293 master cell banks and other components (plasmid DNA banks) required for clinical vector production. Our master cell banks and other components are being used by us and a subset of our NAV Technology Licensees for the production of NAV Vectors under cGMP for use in clinical trials.
Gene Therapy Overview and History of Earlier Generation AAV
 Historically, the primary challenge for gene therapy has been the delivery of genes into cells. Genes are made of DNA, which is a large, highly charged molecule that is difficult to transport across a cell membrane and deliver to the nucleus, where it can be transcribed and translated into protein. The genetic material needs to be delivered efficiently and to the desired target tissues and cell types, which will vary depending on the disease to be treated. Based on this need, scientists have designed and developed a variety of gene vectors in order to facilitate gene delivery in cells.
 To date, the study of gene vectors as treatments in humans has involved approaches with in vivo and ex vivo techniques using a variety of different gene vectors. Each approach presents different features and benefits for the treatment of a particular disease. Ex vivo gene therapy approaches generally are employed to target correction in blood and bone marrow. These methods typically involve harvesting and isolating a patient’s own cells. Both the patient and cells undergo several preparatory steps to allow for modification of the cells by gene vectors. Ultimately, the modified cells are re-administered to the patient. In vivo gene therapy approaches involve directly administering (e.g., by infusion or injection) gene vectors into patients in order to reach desired cells in target tissues (e.g., liver, brain, eye, muscle, heart). These methods rely on a combination of the route of administration and the gene vectors themselves to facilitate the correction in the target tissues.
 14



We focus on in vivo gene therapy. Among vectors available for in vivo gene therapy, viral vectors have been adopted with the greatest frequency because they have demonstrated the greatest efficiency in gene delivery to date. This efficiency exists because viral vectors are derived from naturally occurring viruses whose normal life-cycle relies on gene delivery of their own genomes. In other words, they are naturally optimized to deliver genes to cells. Many viral vectors have presented sub-optimal safety profiles for in vivo treatment in humans because the viruses from which they are derived are pathogenic (causing disease), immunogenic (causing immune response) or create genomic toxicity (delivering a gene to a place where it interrupts normal function). Vectors derived from adenovirus, herpes virus and retroviruses have been tested as in vivo viral vectors.
 Vectors derived from AAV have among the best safety profiles for gene therapy given that AAVs are not known to be associated with disease in humans. The earlier generation AAV vectors were designed by scientists in the mid‑1980s and the first clinical trials using AAV began in the mid‑1990s. There were only a handful of AAV vectors available to scientists at the time of the first clinical trials because AAV vectors were designed based on the capsid (the protein shell of a virus that encloses the genetic material of the virus) of AAV viruses known to be in existence and only six distinct serotypes (groups within a single species of microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses, which share distinctive surface structures) had been discovered at that time. These earlier generation AAV vectors were shown to be limited in their application due to a variety of limitations and challenges, including:
  
• | low or unmeasurable gene expression, meaning the delivered gene was enabling production of low or unmeasurable amounts of the therapeutic protein;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | short-term gene expression, meaning if gene expression was measurable, it was transient;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limited tissue selectivity, meaning concentrated gene expression was not observed in the target organ; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | high levels of immune response, meaning the body may neutralize the gene delivery vector with pre-existing antibodies or generate T-cells that inhibit the therapeutic effect.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Discovery of Next Generation AAV
 In recognition of the limitations and challenges of earlier generation AAV vectors, an effort was undertaken in the early 2000s at Penn to discover other naturally occurring AAV sequences. The identification of such sequences was based on the observation that wild-type AAV (in contrast to recombinant AAV) can undergo a latent cycle in which the AAV genome stays within the cell, meaning the virus, including its capsid gene sequence, remains intact within the cell but does not reproduce. This allowed for identification of new sequences not by purifying viruses from tissues, but by searching for capsid gene sequences in a variety of tissues isolated from non-human primates and from humans, based on regions of the AAV capsid gene that did not vary between the known AAV vectors. By searching for capsid gene sequences in this manner, many more capsid protein sequences were discovered than would have been found by purifying viruses from tissues.
 More than 100 new capsid sequences were identified by the process. The first few were initially designated AAV7, AAV8 and AAV9, after which, other sequences were identified by species from which it was isolated (e.g., “rh” indicating rhesus macaque) followed by a number (e.g., 10, for rh10). Early characterization of the initial discoveries of AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10 suggested that these vectors may be significantly more efficient in various applications important for clinical translation than other previously known AAVs.
 After patenting the next generation AAV vectors, Penn initiated a distribution program through a material-transfer process that enabled researchers to access the next generation AAV vectors for research use only, under specific restrictions. Thousands of custom reagents were sent to independent researchers, who began to characterize and validate the beneficial features of AAV vectors in animal models of disease. In 2010, the first clinical trials were conducted using the next generation AAV vectors and initial proof-of-concept and safety in humans was established from these trials. These clinical trials also produced longer-term efficacy results which reinforced our belief that these next generation vectors have beneficial properties not seen in the earlier generation AAV vectors.
 We believe the next generation AAV vectors, which form the basis of our NAV Technology Platform, have many improved properties relative to earlier generation AAV vectors for development and commercialization of AAV treatments, including:
  
• | higher gene expression;
--+------------------------


• | longer-term gene expression;
--+-----------------------------


• | broad and novel tissue selectivity;
--+------------------------------------


• | lower immune response; and
--+---------------------------


• | improved manufacturability.

Our Proprietary NAV Technology Platform for Gene Delivery
 Our NAV Technology Platform has been used in a number of clinical trials conducted by us, our partners and third-party investigators. In 2009, we licensed rights to the next generation AAV vectors discovered at Penn. Our NAV Vectors form the foundation of our NAV Technology Platform.
 We are developing therapeutics using NAV Vectors that contain genes which are synthesized to code for the expression of therapeutic proteins in target cells to correct the underlying causes of the diseases we seek to treat. Each product candidate is designed with a NAV Vector for a specific cell target and to express a specific protein. We incorporate proprietary modifications to both the AAV and the gene which enhance properties such as potency, stability and tissue distribution. Our proprietary technology, including the use of vectors derived from novel sequences of AAV such as AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10, are protected by over 100 licensed patents and patent applications. The rights to our NAV Technology Platform provide our product candidates with what we believe to be a competitive advantage over product candidates developed with earlier generation AAV vectors due to the novel and beneficial properties of our NAV Vectors.
 Key Potential Benefits of NAV Technology
 The properties that make NAV Vectors unique from and potentially an improvement to earlier generation AAV vectors, as well as provide support that they are potentially best-in-class for development and commercialization of AAV treatments, are set forth in the pages that follow.
Higher Gene Expression
 NAV Vectors have been shown to generate higher levels of gene expression in animals than earlier generation AAV vectors such as AAV2. In mice livers, one of our NAV Vectors, AAV8, produced levels of gene expression that were 10‑ to 100‑fold higher than was achieved with AAV2. The figure below shows the contrast in the amount of gene expressed using the two vectors at the same dose.
 
AAV Transduction in Mouse Liver

In this experiment, the reporter gene LacZ, a gene which encodes a protein that turns a clear substrate blue in a specific medium, was included in the transgene sequence delivered by the vector so that cells expressing the transgene are stained blue, visually denoting expression level. It was possible to transduce the entire mouse liver and achieve long-term expression with AAV8. Higher gene expression creates the possibility of achieving therapeutic benefit in more diseases than was possible using earlier AAV vectors, as more therapeutic protein is generated with vectors that enable higher expression.
 Longer-Term Gene Expression
 We believe the longer-term gene expression seen using NAV Vectors is due to more stable genomic persistence and reduced cellular immunity, which are a function of novel capsid structure and lower dosing required using NAV Vectors due to the greater gene expression discussed earlier. NAV Vectors have demonstrated stable expression in animals for over eight years. Moreover, AAV8 vectors have demonstrated stable expression for over seven years in clinical trials for hemophilia B patients.
 16



Broad and Novel Tissue Selectivity
 NAV Vectors also display high levels of tissue specificity. This property is important because it allows for development of therapeutics to target cells that earlier generation AAV vectors do not target or do not target well. In the CNS, AAV9 has emerged as a vector that enables efficient gene delivery when directly injected into the brain. This was aided by the ability of AAV9 to be transported throughout the brain, enabling broader delivery with a single injection.
 NAV Gene Therapy has demonstrated novel tissue selectivity for the CNS when delivered intravenously. Intravenous delivery of AAV9 resulted in efficient gene expression in the brain and spinal cord, and this route of administration produced results in both small and large animals, including non-human primates. This was the first time a gene therapy vector was demonstrated to cross the blood-brain barrier. This route of administration has recently been used clinically by one of our NAV Technology Licensees to treat SMA Type I.
 NAV Vectors have also shown novel properties in the eye when investigated for the treatment of acquired disease and inherited retinal degenerations. AAV8 expressing a fluorescent protein was administered by subretinal injection in the non-human primate eye in order to show gene expression in the retina itself, which contains the cell types to be treated. As is depicted in the graphic below, a cross-section of the non-human primate retina below showed more efficient gene delivery (as demonstrated by the much greater amount of the fluorescent protein expressed) with AAV8 as compared to AAV2 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and to the photoreceptor (PR) layer. The majority of genes associated with retinal degeneration are located in the RPE and PR layer. These genes influence the cell’s development or function and are therefore critical to most inherited retinal degenerations.

Lower Immune Response
 Lower immune response to the gene therapy vector used to deliver the transgene is important for longer-term gene expression, higher expression and higher potency. Data indicate that more than 50% of certain human populations have a high level of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) for the earlier generation vector AAV2. This represents a major obstacle to the effective use of these earlier generation AAV vectors due to the inhibition of gene delivery via particle neutralization in circulation, meaning pre-existing antibodies neutralize the vector with the transgene before it can reach the target cells. By contrast, frequency of neutralizing antibodies for AAV8 is consistently lower than for AAV2. In a French study, for example, AAV2 NAbs occurred at a frequency of 59% compared to 19% for AAV8. Thus, AAV8 is a candidate for liver-directed gene delivery in a higher proportion of the population than AAV2.
 Additionally, reduced effect from the generation and reactivity of T-cells to NAV Vectors has been demonstrated, relative to earlier generation AAV vectors. Activation of T-cells to the capsid of AAV2 vectors has been implicated in liver toxicity in a clinical trial for the treatment of hemophilia B. A patient in this clinical trial developed an elevation of liver enzymes and subsequently lost expression. This led to a hypothesis that capsid protein antigens and memory T-cell activation may lead to clearance of AAV-transduced cells. To further investigate this kind of toxicity, scientists reported a study that evaluated T-cell responses to AAV vectors after administration to mice and nonhuman primates. In this study, high levels of T-cells specific to capsids of AAV2 were detected. AAV8, however, did not lead to activation of capsid-specific T-cells. In a more recent clinical trial for the treatment of hemophilia B, using AAV8, there was less of an effect from T-cells generated and reactive with AAV8. We believe this is likely a function of the lower doses that can be used as well as the structure of the vector itself.
 17



Improved Manufacturability
 The manufacturing process for NAV Vectors can be designed to reduce the number of difficult processing steps required for the earlier AAV vectors, improving overall yield at larger scale. NAV Vectors are derived from naturally “fit” viruses, which are stable structures that efficiently assemble, in contrast to the earlier generation AAV vectors. During production, NAV Vectors are secreted by AAV producer cells, eliminating the need for lysing (breaking down of the membrane of a cell, often by viral, enzymic or osmotic mechanisms that compromise the cells integrity) of cells, which can complicate purification and impact yield. This is a novel aspect of NAV Vectors that increases yield and efficiency in production.
Platform License Agreements and Other Licenses
 Platform Licenses
 We have exclusively licensed many of our rights in our NAV Technology Platform from Penn and GlaxoSmithKline LLC (GSK), which together we refer to as our Platform Licenses. We currently use our NAV Technology Platform to develop treatments for retinal, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. We also sublicense our NAV Technology Platform to third parties in order to develop and bring to market NAV Gene Therapy for a range of severe diseases with significant unmet medical needs outside of our core disease indications and therapeutic areas.

 The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. In February 2009, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with Penn for patent and other intellectual property rights relating to a gene therapy technology platform based on AAVs discovered at Penn in the laboratory of James M. Wilson, M.D., Ph.D. This license was amended in September 2014 and April 2016. In February 2009, we also entered into an SRA with Penn (the 2009 SRA) under which we funded the nonclinical research of Dr. Wilson relating to AAV gene therapy and obtained an option to acquire an exclusive worldwide license in certain intellectual property created pursuant to such 2009 SRA. We entered into an additional SRA (the 2013 SRA) with Penn in November 2013 which was funded entirely by our NAV Technology Licensee, Dimension Therapeutics, Inc. (since acquired by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.) (Dimension). In December 2014, we entered into another SRA with Penn funding related nonclinical research of Dr. Wilson (the 2014 SRA).

Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, core technologies and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our rights. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our position in the field of gene therapy. Additionally, we intend to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity as well as patent term extensions, where available.
 We anticipate that our patent portfolio will continue to expand as a result of our SRAs with academic institutions, including the 2014 SRA with Penn, and our commercial licenses to NAV Technology Licensees. For further information regarding our commercial sublicenses, please see “Commercial Licenses to NAV Technology Licensees” located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers
 Our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of license revenue. Two customers (AveXis Inc. (AveXis) and Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Abeona)) accounted for approximately 97% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. One customer (AveXis) accounted for approximately 68% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2017. Two customers accounted for approximately 68% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2016. We expect future license revenue to be derived from a limited number of licensees. Future license revenue is uncertain due to the contingent nature of our licenses granted to third-parties and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. 
Research and Development 
 We are building a research and development organization that includes extensive expertise in AAV gene therapy and related scientific disciplines. We operate cross-functionally and are led by an experienced research and development management team. We use rigorous project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic research and development program decisions and to help limit the risk profile of our product pipeline. We also access relevant market information and key opinion leaders in creating target product profiles when appropriate, as we advance our programs towards commercialization. We engage third parties to conduct portions of our preclinical research. In addition, we are utilizing multiple clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the field of gene therapy, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. While we believe that our NAV Technology Platform, strong intellectual property portfolio and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, new market entrants and new technologies.
 We are aware of a number of companies focused on developing gene therapies in various disease indications, including Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc., Amicus Therapeutics, Inc., Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., MeiraGTx Limited, Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., Sanofi Genzyme, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., Solid Biosciences Inc., Spark Therapeutics, Inc. and uniQure N.V. as well as a number of companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Additionally, we have sublicensed our NAV Technology Platform for developing gene therapies in various disease indications to our NAV Technology Licensees. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy products using earlier generation AAV technology and other gene therapy platforms, but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 22



There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies or to develop new therapies for our initially selected disease indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our product candidates, if approved. These efforts include the following:
  
• | Wet AMD. Marketed competition for wet AMD largely consists of anti-VEGF therapies developed by Roche/Genentech, Inc. (Lucentis, Avastin) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Eylea).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HoFH. There are several companies with marketed products for the treatment of HoFH, including Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Juxtapid), Amgen Inc. (Repatha) and Kastle Therapeutics (Kynamro).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MPS I. There is one principal competitor with a marketed product for the treatment of MPS I, Sanofi Genzyme (Aldurazyme).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MPS II. The principal marketed competition for MPS II is a systemic enzyme replacement therapy, which is marketed by Shire plc (Elaprase).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | CLN2 Disease. There is one principal competitor with a marketed product for the treatment of CLN2 Disease, BioMarin (Brineura).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Government Regulation
 In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), and the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA.
 
Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates gene therapy products. The FDA has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. 
 Ethical, scientific, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

U.S. Biological Products Development Process
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, including evaluations of product chemistry, formulations, toxicity in animal studies in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s requirements for good clinical practice (GCP) and additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies, as well as information on the chemistry, manufacturing and controls to ensure product identity and quality, and proposed labeling;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practice (GTP), for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical study sites and the clinical study sponsor that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations imposing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Clinical studies generally also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee (IBC), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. Some studies also employ a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which operates with independence from the study sponsor and has access to unblinded study data during the course of the study and may halt a study for ethical reasons such as undue safety risks.
 24



Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase I. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. However, in the case of some products for rare, severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In some cases, Phase IV studies may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for as long as 15 years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for expedited reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its DSMB may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, our ability to recruit sufficient numbers of study subjects for any trial, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee payment unless an exception or waiver applies. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers of pediatric requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 25



Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, including whether it is effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity as those factors relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product upon marketing. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTP. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/Ps) which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months of the 60-day filing date and 90% of priority BLAs in six months of the 60-day filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. Two months are added to these time periods for new molecular entities. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information, or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, constituting a major amendment to the BLA.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined under the FD&C Act as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 26



If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that product for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union (EU) has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 Orphan drug products are also eligible for Rare Pediatric Disease Designation if greater than 50% of patients living with the disease are under age 18. A priority review voucher will be given to the sponsor of a product with a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation at the time of product approval that is transferable to another company. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products, including precision drugs or biological products, that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Also under the Fast Track program, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for additional benefits when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. In addition, gene therapies, including genetically modified cells, that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues, may be eligible for regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation. Products with an RMAT designation are eligible for the benefits of Breakthrough Therapy in addition to allowing the sponsor the ability to participate in meetings with the FDA to discuss whether accelerated approval would be appropriate based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition compared to marketed products. Specific priority review programs exist for material threat medical countermeasures, rare pediatric diseases and tropical diseases. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, in accordance with FDA guidance. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA will require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to confirm the clinical benefit of the medicine. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-submission of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy or RMAT designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval. Rather, these programs are intended to expedite the development and approval process, but do not necessarily accomplish that intent.

Post-Approval Requirements
 Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, strength, quality, potency, or purity of a distributed product in a manner that may impact the safety or effectiveness of the product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
 We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion and related medical communication requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), the requirement to balance promotion information on efficacy with important safety information and limitations on use, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product or conditions of approval, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 28



A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted in the case of a biologic approved under a BLA, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 Additional Regulation
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. PPACA amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29



 
• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to: items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances. Many of these state and foreign laws differ from federal law and from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. New metrics frequently are used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, it may be necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. Health Technology Assessment which is intended to take account of medical, social, economic and ethical issues when determining the suitability of a medicinal product for reimbursement has increasingly become an element of the pricing and reimbursement decisions of the competent authorities in EU Member States.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, PPACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increasing the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extending the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressing a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and establishing annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 30



U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in bribery and corruption when dealing with foreign government officials. It is illegal to corruptly pay, offer to pay, promise or authorize the payment of money or anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign government official, political party or political candidate in an attempt to secure an improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business or to otherwise improperly influence a foreign official in his or her official capacity. Comparable laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations. We are also subject to the FCPA’s accounting provisions, which require us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to assure management’s control, authority, and responsibility over the company’s assets.  The failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could result in civil or criminal sanctions or other adverse consequences.  
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Many countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the EU, for example, an application for authorization of a clinical trial must be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities and a request for a related positive opinion must be submitted to the competent Ethics Committees in the EU Member States in which the clinical trial takes place, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial has been approved by the competent regulatory authorities and a positive opinion has been provided by the competent Ethics Committees in accordance with the EU and the EU Member State requirements, the corresponding clinical trial may proceed. The approval procedures and ethics committee involvement requirements vary to some extent among the EU Member States. Until the new EU Regulation on Clinical Trials (Reg. EU No. 536/2014) becomes applicable, trial sponsors must obtain individual approvals in every EU Member State where a trial site is located.
 To obtain regulatory approval of a biological medicinal product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The grant of marketing authorization in the EU for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorization and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), commonly referred to as the EMA Regulation. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. The EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) is responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP). ATMP include gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. The role of the CAT is to prepare a draft opinion on an application for marketing authorization for an ATMP candidate that is submitted to the EMA. The EMA then provides a final opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization after the EMA has delivered its opinion.
 Innovative medicinal products are authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies, in whole or in part, on data in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved medicinal product). Applications for marketing authorization for innovative medicinal products must contain the results of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is sought. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products cannot rely on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product to support their application. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are also entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During these ten years of market exclusivity, no generic or biosimilar medicinal product may be placed on the EU market even if a marketing authorization application for approval of a generic or biosimilar of the innovative product has been submitted to the EMA or to the competent regulatory authorities in the EU Member States and marketing authorization has been granted. The ten years of market exclusivity will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product which is eligible for the relevant periods of data and market exclusivity.
 31



Products authorized as “orphan medicinal products” in the EU are entitled to benefits additional to those granted in relation to innovative medicinal products. In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Further guidance on such criteria is provided in European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 of 27 April 2000 laying down the provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product and definitions of the concepts “similar medicinal product” and “clinical superiority”. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and following grant of a marketing authorization, the EMA and the EU Member States’ competent authorities are not permitted to accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization or accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization, for the same therapeutic indication of a similar medicinal product for ten years following grant or authorization. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant may receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The 10-year market exclusivity that an orphan drug enjoys may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if:
  
• | The second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Similar to obligations imposed in the United States, medicinal products authorized in the EU may be subject to post-authorization obligations, including the obligation to conduct Post Marketing Safety Studies (PASS) or Post Marketing Efficacy Studies (PAES).
 Moreover, in the EU, the sole legal instrument at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC (the Price Transparency Directive). The aim of the Price Transparency Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the EU and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not, however, provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing or levels of reimbursement in individual EU Member States. The national authorities of the individual EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use. Individual EU Member States adopt policies according to which a specific price or level of reimbursement is approved for the medicinal product. Other EU Member States adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territory either, on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries, or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Furthermore, some EU Member States impose direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
 Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States. These countries include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Sweden. The HTA process in the EU Member States is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of the use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the national healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
 32



The outcome of HTA may influence the pricing and reimbursement status for specific medicinal products within individual EU member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of a specific medicinal product vary between the EU Member States.
 In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the EU level. This Directive concerns the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the EU. It also provides for the establishment of a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA between EU Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and negatively impact price in at least some EU Member States. On 31 January 2018, the European Commission adopted a new legislative proposal to amend Directive 2011/24/EU. The proposal aims at boosting the cooperation regarding HTA among the EU Member States. It covers new medicinal products and certain new medical devices. The proposal provides the possibility for EU Member States to use common HTA tools, methodologies and procedures across the EU and to perform joint clinical assessments. The proposal is expected to be adopted as new legislation within the next three years.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
