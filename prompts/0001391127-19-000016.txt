Limelight provides digital content delivery, online video delivery, cloud security, edge computing, and cloud storage services. Limelight’s edge services platform includes a globally distributed, high-performance private network, intelligent software, and support services.
The services we provide help our customers optimize and deliver digital content to a wide variety of digital devices. These services provide advanced features to enable digital workflows for live and on-demand video publishing, online gaming, content distribution to any device, and website and web application acceleration. Limelight services incorporate content and application security, file management, video transformation, distributed storage functionality, and the analytics and reporting associated with them. These services leverage our high capacity, high speed private global network, which offers distributed computing resources and extensive connectivity to last-mile broadband network providers, making it well suited to the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and edge compute workloads where rapid response times are needed.
We derive revenue primarily from the sale of content delivery, video delivery, cloud security, and edge cloud and origin storage services . We also generate revenue through the sale of professional services and other infrastructure services, such as transit and rack space services. In addition, we also maintain relationships with resellers that purchase our services for resale to their end customers.
We provide our services to customers that we believe view internet, mobile, social, and other digital initiatives as critical to their success, including traditional and emerging media companies operating in the television, music, radio, newspaper, magazine, movie, gaming, software, and social media industries, as well as to enterprises, technology companies, and government entities conducting business online. Our offerings enable our customers to deliver a high-quality online experience and thereby improve brand perception, drive revenue, and enhance customer relationships. 
We are a Delaware corporation formed in 2001. Our principal executive offices are located at 222 South Mill Avenue, 8th Floor, Tempe, Arizona, 85281, and our main telephone number is (602) 850-5000. We began development of our infrastructure in 2001 and began generating meaningful revenue in 2002. We began international operations in 2004. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 649 active customers and had a presence in approximately 50 countries throughout the world.

Trends Driving Internet Growth 
We have identified several trends that point to an internet of the future in which there is a need for global delivery of the highest quality digital experience:

• | Shift to over the top (OTT) consumption for online video. Online video viewership continues to grow, as does the range of devices being used to consume that content. OTT distribution is typically included in major content rights offerings and the range of content available is increasing to incorporate additional and complementary content for distribution online. In our September 2018 State of Online Video consumer report, we found that global consumers watch approximately 6 hours and 45 minutes of online video per week on average, with Millennials far exceeding 8 hours. Viewing habits are shifting as well. There is an increasing use of a multitude of devices to watch online video both inside and outside the home, ranging from computers and tablets to smartphones and streaming devices, and specific video content is now being produced for these devices. Many top-tier content owners have either

2

already launched their content direct-to-consumer (e.g., HBO, CBS, Showtime) or have announced plans to do so. In addition, content owners continue to join forces with media companies (e.g., Sony, Hulu, AT&T) to launch OTT subscription streaming services enabling consumers to bundle together channels for a fraction of the cost of a cable subscription. As consumption of video content shifts to internet-based delivery, we believe this will put an increasing strain on the internet, placing additional pressure on content distributors and service providers to take steps to protect the quality of the end-user experience as this increasing segment of traffic competes with other internet activities, such as browsing websites and downloading digital content.

• | Broadcast Quality Online Video. Online video is rapidly growing towards becoming a primary method by which users consume video content, whether it’s via their personal computers, smartphones, tablets, smart televisions, or other connected devices. Yet, consumers continue to expect the same quality experience online as they would have in viewing broadcast television. This puts a significant burden on publishers to produce not just compelling content, but also to deliver it in a way that meets changing consumer expectations. To keep up, organizations have been forced to increase quality to provide a “broadcast-like” experience. For example, several large-scale online video providers are already streaming video in 4K resolution. In most cases, this requires four times the bandwidth of a traditional high definition stream. We believe that as more content is made available in 4K resolution (coupled with increasing sales of 4K-ready devices like televisions and computer monitors), more consumers will want to consume the higher-quality content, resulting in increased strain on internet architecture and infrastructure. 


• | Growth of digital downloads. Consumers are becoming more accustomed to making purchases of movies, music, games, and applications digitally from a variety of retailers with the growing availability of higher bandwidth connections to connected devices. As a result, consumers accept larger download sizes. For example, releases of popular games have topped 50 gigabytes (GBs) in size. As digital purchases of massive files increase, we believe this will cause more strain on the internet’s infrastructure. We believe this will result in additional pressure on organizations and service providers to take steps to avoid congestion, latency, lengthening download times, and increasingly interrupted downloads, all of which we believe would undermine an organization’s ability to deliver the best possible digital experience.


• | Applications and Websites. Organizations are responding to consumer demand for their services to be available online and on their mobile devices by building more interactive and engaging digital experiences. While striving to retain consumers and increase share of wallet through modern design and user experience paradigms, the underlying complexity and range of back-end services modern applications and websites rely on is increasing along with their reliance on imagery and multimedia content to engage consumers. We believe that maintaining application and website performance will be critical for organizations, and that their success and longevity will depend on their ability to deliver the level of performance that users expect. This high performance delivery will become harder as demand for services increases and drives up bandwidth consumption in mobile and fixed networks.


• | The Internet of Things. Connected devices communicate with each other and with server-based resources via the internet. Although it is unclear as to how much bandwidth this “background communication” will consume, as more devices become connected and begin communicating with each other and other resources, this traffic will compete with other internet traffic such as streaming video and digital downloads. We believe IoT may complicate an organization’s ability to utilize the internet to deliver high quality digital experiences.

Trends Illustrating Consumer Demand for Digital Content
The internet is key for today’s digital business. We believe there are a number of trends that illustrate a demand for digital content, contribute to the overall usage of the internet, increase potential congestion, and highlight the need for a private, global network to meet the level of performance that users expect. We believe these trends are:

• | The continued growth of online video. Consumers are demanding and consuming video, music, and other forms of rich media over the internet. According to Cisco's Visual Networking Index annual report, internet video will account for 82% of consumer internet traffic by 2022. Based on this trend, we expect broadcasters and OTT content distributors will continue to expand their online programming to meet this growing demand and businesses will continue to incorporate video into their digital marketing efforts as a way to further differentiate their message from competitors and generate new opportunities for engagement.


• | Mobile First. We believe that mobile will continue to be increasingly important as a primary method users employ to interact with online content. Mobile devices enable consumers to remain connected and engaged with an organization’s content when they are away from their primary computers or TVs and it’s clear that consumers are employing these devices more often to do so. However, in order for those consumers to remain engaged, the

3

experience must be optimized across devices. An organization’s online content, services and video library has to be accessible regardless of device and provide the same engagement and interaction with those users.

• | The continued migration of information technology (IT) services into the cloud. Enterprises may seek to decrease infrastructure expenditures by moving to a “cloud-based” model in which application delivery and storage are available on-demand and paid for on an as-needed basis. We anticipate that the core cloud computing market will continue to grow at a rapid pace as the cloud increasingly becomes a mainstream IT strategy embraced by corporate enterprises and government agencies. The core cloud market includes platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings such as content delivery networks (CDN), as well as the cloud-delivered software used to build and manage a cloud environment.


• | Increasing use of Edge Computing. While traditional cloud computing architectures offer the ability to centralize the aggregation and processing of data for applications, this centralization introduces latencies that can be problematic for real-time applications that require instant response. To address these limitations, edge computing is being increasingly utilized to process real-time data for applications such as online gaming, safety and security, and IoT inspection and monitoring to solve these issues in a scalable manner. We expect to see continued interest in the creation of platforms that enable applications to be distributed, managed and scaled as so-called “micro-services” and further split down into individual functional elements that are then scaled on demand within edge services platforms. 


• | Increasing user expectations for digital experience performance. Applications and websites are becoming increasingly complex, while user expectations of performance are becoming more demanding. We anticipate that these demanding consumer expectations will drive a continued need for website and web application acceleration and security services. The combination of performance expectation coupled with multi-device delivery creates a considerable challenge for most organizations. 


• | Increasing need for scalable storage. The amount of data created each year has grown rapidly, and we believe this rapid growth in data production will create demand for flexible and scalable storage mechanisms to support growing libraries of digital content. We anticipate the need for cloud storage to increase because of the growing demand for video and other types of digital content.


• | Global broadband speed increase. With each passing year, the average broadband connection speed is increasing around the world. The continued increase in speed is illustrative of consumer desire to access multimedia content (e.g. online video, game downloads, interactive web applications) through the internet and how integral rich, digital experiences have become the way people conduct their lives on a daily basis.

Requirements for delivering effective digital experiences 
We believe the challenges of delivering digital content, particularly related to rich media, dynamic content, and applications over the internet to a wide variety of mobile and connected devices, have created a new set of technical, management, and economic requirements for organizations. We believe those requirements include the following:

• | Ability to scale capacity to handle rapidly accelerating demand. Online businesses must scale delivery of their web presence smoothly as the quantity of their site visitors or audience increases to avoid delays for users. When a large number of users simultaneously access a particular digital content asset such as a video, the operator must be able to meet that surge in demand without making users wait. Rapidly accelerating demand can be related to a single event such as a breaking news story or seasonal shopping or can be spread across an entire library of content, such as when a social media website surges in popularity. The continued increase in video and other rich media consumption and the growing size of digital content objects contributes to concerns that internet bandwidth may be supply constrained in the future.


• | Security. Maintaining effective security is a challenge for any enterprise that operates online. Denial of service attacks, data breaches, viruses, piracy, and other threats can impact companies in many ways, including compromising personal and sensitive information, loss of customer trust and loyalty, loss of revenue, and negative publicity and brand reputation. Businesses require services that employ a number of software and network features to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to content and network-related attacks against web properties, digital content, and applications. There continues to be an increasing number of high-profile security incidents that raise the awareness and strategic importance of online security.


• | Conditional access to content. Consumers increasingly expect the ability to consume any form of media content online. To meet this expectation, traditional media companies are making their enormous libraries of content, such

4

as television shows and movies, available for viewing online. Content distributors often have regulations with respect to where they can display or store their content due to industry requirements or geographic location. Accordingly, companies require powerful features that enable them to control where content is stored, for how long, and in what regions it can be delivered and viewed.

• | Ability to easily publish and deliver online video. As consumer demand for online video grows, businesses and organizations are adopting video into their marketing messages. However, there are a host of complexities involved in developing and implementing a “video publishing workflow.” Businesses require intuitive tools that enable them to manage their video portfolio and quickly and efficiently publish and deliver their video content at scale with quality performance. Additionally, many businesses require video content to be converted automatically for playback on any mobile device with the opportunity to integrate advertisements.


• | Multi-device delivery. With the increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets, businesses and organizations must ensure that their content, whether dynamic web pages or video, can display properly in mobile formats. However, adding this requirement to existing content publishing workflows can greatly complicate internal processes that may result in delays for making content available to end-users. Additionally, because many mobile devices have separate requirements, businesses will require features for automatically delivering correctly formatted content.


• | Reliability and Consistency. Throughout the path data must traverse to reach a user, problems with the underlying infrastructure supporting the internet can occur. For example, servers can crash or network connections can fail. Network, data center, or service provider outages can mean frustrated users, lost audiences, and missed revenue opportunities. Businesses require a massively redundant network they can depend on to ensure the reliable and consistent delivery of their digital experiences.

Our Services 
We believe our powerful edge services platform with its global private IP network, intelligent software, and service and support addresses the trends driving internet growth and the requirements for delivering effective digital experiences. Our primary services include the following:

• | Content delivery. Limelight operates one of the world’s largest private networks with the capacity, coverage, and performance to deliver websites, mobile applications, videos, music, software, games, and APIs quickly, reliably, and securely. We have developed and optimized our own software stack to deliver maximum performance over any connection type with a fully integrated suite of software services. 


• | Video delivery. Limelight's live, on-demand video delivery services and online video platform help organizations manage, publish, syndicate, analyze, and monetize video content. Limelight simplifies the process of delivering video to any devices and makes it easy to integrate advertising into online video content. 


• | Cloud security. Limelight's cloud security services offer a layered defense against malicious app and website attacks and unauthorized content access. DDoS attack protection defends against denial of service attacks, and Web Application Firewall protection guards against attacks that are intended to compromise the back-end services of applications and web sites, in order to deface, disable or steal data. TLS/SSL capabilities encrypt data so it cannot be intercepted in transit, and multiple content security methods are available so only authorized users have access to content.


• | Edge Cloud. Limelight’s edge cloud provides a fast, scalable, and secure infrastructure for low-latency IoT and edge compute applications. It reduces latencies and enables real time and highly interactive applications by moving processing power from a central point to the network edge.


• | Origin Storage. Limelight offers scalable, redundant, geographically diverse cloud storage with the flexibility and automation to support any content delivery workflow. Limelight simplifies and automates the process of ingesting and managing content while delivering fast performance and high availability.

Limelight Global Network 
Our global network provides highly available, highly redundant storage, bandwidth, and computing resources in support of our services and solutions. This architecture, managed by our proprietary software, automatically responds to network and data center outages and disruptions. All of our delivery locations are interconnected via our global network and are connected to multiple internet backbone and broadband internet service provider (ISP) networks. This global network has three main features:
5


• | Densely configured, high-capacity. Our global private network includes a fiber backbone that connects our delivery Points-of-Presence (PoPs) and enables content to bypass the congested public internet as it is distributed to the end-user. Each Limelight PoP has a high density of fast servers that enable high cache-hit efficiency, providing faster delivery performance.


• | Global Scalability. Limelight's global network infrastructure includes PoPs in more than 40 metropolitan locations in every region of the world. This allows us to cache and deliver content from locations close to where it is being requested. Limelight's network is also directly interconnected with more than 900 major ISPs and last-mile network providers, shortening the distance and number of hops that content needs to take.


• | Intelligent software to manage the network. We have developed proprietary software that manages our global network. This software manages, among other things, the delivery of digital content, the retrieval of dynamic content, storage and retrieval of objects, activity logging, and information reporting.

Sales, Service and Marketing 
Our sales and service professionals are located in four offices in the United States with an additional eight office locations in EMEA and Asia Pacific. We target media, high tech, software, gaming, enterprise, and other organizations for which the delivery of digital content is critical to the success of their business. 
Our sales and service organization includes employees in telesales and field sales, professional services, account management, and solutions engineering. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 141 employees in our sales organization. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in large part on whether we successfully recruit, train, and retain sufficient sales, technical, and global services personnel, and how well we establish and maintain our distribution and reseller relationships. We believe that the complexity of our services will continue to require highly trained global sales and services personnel. 
To support our sales efforts and promote the Limelight brand, we conduct marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign, advertisements, events and trade shows, digital marketing activities, strategic alliances, and on-going customer communication programs. As of December 31, 2018, we had 28 employees in our global marketing organization.
Customers 
Our customers operate in the media, entertainment, gaming, software, enterprise, retail and other sectors. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 649 active customers worldwide, including many widely recognized names in the fields of online video, digital music, news media, games, rich media applications, and software delivery. 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, we had one customer, Amazon, who accounted for approximately 30% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had no customer who accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue. In the past, the customers that comprise our top 20 customers have continually changed, and our large customers may not continue to be as significant going forward as they have been in the past. 
From time to time we have discontinued service to customers for non-payment. Although we did not receive continuing revenue from these former customers, these changes provided for a stronger mix of customers across our base, decreased our days sales outstanding, and allowed us to recoup network capacity to help meet future growth needs. We continue to focus on acquiring and retaining high quality customers across all market segments. 
Competition 
We operate in the digital content delivery market, which is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We expect this competitive environment to continue. 
The principal methods of competition in this market include scale, performance, service, ease of use, product features, and price. We primarily face competition from Akamai, CenturyLink, Amazon, CDNetworks, Fastly, StackPath, and Verizon Digital Media Services.
Product feature competition is intense, requiring continuous investment in innovation. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to continue to innovate and enhance the performance, integration, and functionality of our existing suite of services and of our global network, and on our ability to add additional services and functionality to meet the market’s increasing expectations regarding digital content delivery and consumer engagement.

We believe our combination of cloud-based software and infrastructure/bandwidth associated with our physical global network solves multiple challenges for customers by removing the need to install, manage, or provision software and hardware to satisfy the requirements for storing and delivering digital content. In addition, the market for digital content delivery can sometimes require multiple vendors to provide customers with a complete set of tools and services to manage and deliver all of their digital content to all audiences as part of a global digital presence. We also believe that in those situations where multiple vendors are required, Limelight offers one of the few CDNs with the scale, performance, and reach required to deliver digital content to global audiences.
Research and Development 
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and certification of the software, hardware, and network architecture of our global network and support of our content delivery and other Limelight solutions. As of December 31, 2018, we had 174 employees and employee equivalents in our research and development group. Our research and development personnel are primarily located in Boston, Massachusetts; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Seattle, Washington; Lviv, Ukraine, and at our headquarters in Tempe, Arizona. Our engineering efforts support product development across all of our service areas, as well as innovation related to the global network itself. We test our services to ensure scalability in times of peak demand. We use internally developed and third-party software to monitor and to improve the performance of our network in the major internet consumer markets around the world where we provide services for our customers. Our research and development expenses were $24,075, $25,342, and $24,335 in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, including stock-based compensation expense of $2,720, $2,322, and $2,104 in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and other intellectual capital. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, domain registrations, and contractual protections.
As of December 31, 2018, we had received 128 patents in the United States, expiring between 2023 and 2036, and we had 1 U.S. patent application pending. We do not have any issued patents in foreign countries. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any patents that may be issued to us may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. Therefore, we cannot predict the exact effect of having a patent with certainty.
As of December 31, 2018, we had received four trademarks in the United States. Our name, Limelight Networks, has been filed for multiple classes in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. We have 23 non United States trademarks registered. There is a risk that pending trademark applications may not issue, and that those trademarks that have issued may be challenged by others who believe they have superior rights to the marks.
We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including physical and electronic security, contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and domestic and foreign copyright laws.
Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights and other intellectual property rights by following sound business practices, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, there is risk that unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we have been expanding our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Further, expansion of our business with additional employees, locations, and legal jurisdictions may create greater risk that our trade secrets and proprietary rights will be harmed. If we fail to effectively protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business could be harmed.
Third parties could claim that our products or technologies infringe their proprietary rights. The digital content delivery market is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We expect that infringement claims may further increase as the number of products, services, and competitors in our market increases. Further, continued success in this market may provide an impetus to those who might use intellectual property litigation as a weapon against us. We have been the target of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and may be the target of such claims by third parties in the future.

We were party to patent litigation with Akamai Technologies, Inc. from 2006 through 2018, when the parties agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes between the parties. More information about the cases are described in further detail under Note 10 “Contingencies - Legal Matters" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 563 employees and employee equivalents. Of these, 386 are based in the Americas, 129 are based in EMEA and 48 are based in Asia Pacific. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have not experienced any work stoppages to date. We consider the relationships with our employees to be positive.
