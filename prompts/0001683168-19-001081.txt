ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
History
 
Medicine Man Technologies, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) was incorporated on March 20, 2014, in the State of Nevada. On May 1, 2014, we entered into a non-exclusive Technology License Agreement with Futurevision, Inc., fka Medicine Man Production Corp., dba Medicine Man Denver (hereinafter, “Medicine Man Denver”) pursuant to which Medicine Man Denver granted us a license to use all of their proprietary processes that they had developed, implemented and practiced at their cannabis facilities relating to the commercial growth, cultivation, marketing and distribution of medical marijuana and recreational marijuana pursuant to relevant state laws and the right to use and to license such information, including trade secrets, skills and experience (present and future) (the “License Agreement”) in consideration for the issuance of 5,331,000 shares of our Common Stock. We accounted for this license in accordance with ASC 350-30-30 “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other” by recognizing the fair value of the amount paid by us for the asset at the time of purchase. Since we had a limited operating history, management elected to use the par value of our Common Stock as the value recognized for the transaction. Since the term of the License Agreement is ten (10) years, the cost of the asset will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the License Agreement. In addition, we will evaluate the intangible asset for impairment every quarter. Medicine Man Denver is owned by some of our affiliates. See “Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Part III, Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.”


Acquisition of Pono Publications, Ltd., Success Nutrients, Inc. and Associated Intellectual Property
 
On February 27, 2017, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Pono Publications Ltd., as well as a Share Exchange Agreement with Success Nutrients, Inc., each a Colorado corporation, in order to facilitate our acquisition of both of these entities, which were owned by Joshua_Haupt, who currently serves as one of our directors.
 
Pono, via Medicine Man Technologies, Inc. provides cultivation consulting services to the cannabis industry in Colorado and elsewhere. It is also the owner of a registered trademark, “Three A Light” through which it has published a book on how to cultivate marijuana. The Pono Publications Ltd. brand includes the Three A Light™ cultivation publication with a ‘Professional Grade’ version used exclusively for both Three A Light™ and our current and future clients. This new cultivation protocol has already achieved yields in the 850-gram per square foot range of flowering canopy per year and is deployable in both greenhouse and indoor based cultivation facilities.
 
The Success Nutrients brand provides one of the key underpinnings of the cultivation methodology and is essential to the overall Three A Light™ performance metric. With an investment of two years of research, development and intense testing, this product line was specifically formulated for the cannabis industry. See “Nutrient Products (Group 3),” below.
 
On June 3, 2017, the Company issued 7,000,000 shares of Common Stock to the owner in consideration for the acquisition of Success Nutrients and Pono Publications.
 
Acquisition of the Denver Consulting Group, Inc.
 
In May 2017 we entered into a Binding Term Agreement for the acquisition of Denver Consulting Group, Inc., an industry consultant located in Denver, Colorado.
 
On or about July 26, 2017, we completed the acquisition and issued 2,258,065 shares of our Common Stock in consideration for the acquisition of Denver Consulting Group.

Acquisition of the Big Tomato, LLC
 
On September 20, 2018, we closed the acquisition of Two JS LLC, dba The Big Tomato, a Colorado limited liability company. (“Big T” or “Big Tomato”). The effective date of this acquisition was September 17, 2018.
 
To acquire The Big Tomato we issued an aggregate of 1,933,329 shares of our common stock to the Big T members in exchange for 100% of their issued and outstanding member interests, representing approximately 7% of our issued and outstanding stock following the closing. We also paid approximately $307,000 for inventory in cash, including the assumption of approximately $250,000 in inventory account payable.
 
The transaction was undertaken as a reverse triangular merger, wherein we formed a wholly owned subsidiary company, which merged with and into Big T. As a result, Big T is now a wholly owned subsidiary of our Company. The transaction did not result in a change in our current management.
 
OUR CURRENT BUSINESS GROUPINGS
 
As we evolve our various business lines and branding strategies we are working to align our service offerings and earned income into logical groupings. We have aligned them into three business units that will allow our potential clients and investors a better understanding of both our current and future operations. The specifics of these newly established groups are as follows:
 
GROUP 1 –Consulting and Licensing Services
 
In prior years we have generated revenues from our consulting activities, as well as seminars we have conducted for prospective clients interested in entering the cannabis industry. During 2016, we began to limit these seminars and devote our resources to what we consider to be higher upside activities, including private consultation services and related matters. We expect these services to augment our existing seminar offerings and over time replace most of our local seminar offerings. Following is a description of these services as they exist at the time of this filing. The Company reserves the right to modify, offer new, delete or otherwise change any of the elements without further notice.
 
Private Consulting Package
 
This package sets the foundation for groups considering entering the cannabis space by providing real world examples of projects and cannabis industry marketplaces in which we have worked. The Two-Hour Private Consultation is also the main entry point for clients considering our services to have the opportunity to sit down with our team and learn more about our licensing services. Consultation fees collected are credited back to clients who proceed with our full licensing packages.
 
This package is recommended for individuals and business owners that need more guidance and personal consultation when working to advance their own goals in the cannabis industry and to increase their business’s success.

Seminar Offering Services
 
We offer seminars at our facilities in Denver, CO. The crash course seminars are designed to educate participants about the requirements associated with becoming licensed operators in their own geographic market, and include guidance and tips on navigating:

· | Industry opportunities 
--+-----------------------------------------
· | Medical and Recreational Market Trends 
· | Cultivation Methodologies and Technology
· | Processing Methodologies and Technology 
· | Extraction Technology 
· | Dispensary Operations 
· | Operating Pros and Cons 
· | Security Requirements 
· | Banking, Tax, and Finance 
· | Real Estate Planning and Tips 
· | License Application Planning and Tips 
· | Advocacy, Outreach and Lobbying 

 
The Denver-based seminars end with a tour of Medicine Man Denver’s cultivation and dispensary facilities, allowing participants to get a first-hand view of a fully compliant medical and recreational cultivation and dispensary operation.
 
Facility Design Services
 
Our personnel have an aggregate of 50 years’ experience designing indoor, greenhouse and hybrid growing facilities as well as retail dispensaries. Our design team consists of an architect and a contracting firm that have a wealth of knowledge in the medical and recreational cannabis cultivation and retail space; having designed and constructed numerous facilities throughout the state of Colorado and other markets. Our team will collaborate with a client’s local architect and general contractor to develop an optimal design and construction plan that will meet all IBC (International Building Code) and zoning codes while supporting the Variable Capacity Continuous Harvest model. Our team will provide all blue prints, lighting, tables, shelving specs and any other pertinent intellectual property, developed and refined by Medicine Man Denver.
 
We have experience in supporting multiple facility layouts and deployments, including both existing and new buildings. We have worked through both deployments and have extensive knowledge within industrial building environments. Based upon this experience we believe our documented designs and floor plans will ensure that a client’s facility will operate at maximum efficiency from day one, avoiding the multitude of costly mistakes made by many cannabis startups.
 
New State Application Process Support Services 
 
Through our licensing and application support services we supplement as needed a client’s efforts within a competitive or non-competitive state application process with the goal of securing a state-issued operating license. Once licensed, we help clients deploy state of the art facilities, train staff, implement standard operating procedures, and become operational.
 
Our primary objective is to help clients deliver a positive customer experience with the utmost attention to product, public, and patient safety. We educate our clients on how to produce the highest quality products with the lowest cost of production, delivered to customers with great customer service on a consistent and safe basis. Through basic application support guidance elements, we support our client’s efforts in pursuit of state-issued operating license. Our team also provides cultivation and/or dispensary elements as needed to demonstrate sufficiency within an application.

We have experience working within both competitive and non-competitive application environments. We have had clients in eighteen states, including: Colorado, Nevada, Illinois, New York, Maryland, Hawaii, Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico. As each state handles the process differently, we believe we bring a wealth of knowledge and experience in working through an application. We engage in an "on the ground" approach – ensuring clients receive support when it matters most. As a result, our clients have successfully filed winning cultivation and dispensary applications across several states.
 
Entities applying for medical and recreational operating licenses will have to demonstrate their ability to provide patient, product, and public safety while also maximizing their productivity to meet the forthcoming demand with high-quality, consistent products. As a result of the acquisitions of Pono and Success Nutrients (discussed above). We now estimate that our cultivation processes have increased the per light productivity to an average of 3 pounds of dried, cured flower per 1,000W fixture. While this is applicable to the entire cannabis industry, we believe this is particularly invaluable in states which impose limits on canopy size or plant counts, or in instances in which operators have a limited space to cultivate. We treat cultivation like manufacturing, with the underlying principal that control of inputs, process, environment, and climate will yield consistent output, enabled by our supporting process.
 
Clients who successfully achieve state licensure may also engage us for managed facility support as well as various deployment and training services. This offering provides a turn-key solution for new operators, inclusive of support with pursuit of licensure, design and deployment of their facility, and ongoing management of the facility for a defined period.
 
Three-A-Light Publication (Home Version) 
 
Pono was incorporated in the State of Colorado on February 16, 2015. It is the holder of all intellectual property rights relating to the cannabis cultivation of full-scale commercial grow operations utilized and proposed to be utilized by our current and future clients. No patents have been filed to protect the various methods and expertise utilized for these commercial grows due to the federal prohibition on cannabis.
 
“Three-A-Light” is a tutorial for how to grow cannabis plants for the individual grower growing for his own benefit or caregiver growing for their patients in a limited way. The book has been sold on Amazon at a price of $500 per copy. To date, roughly 1,900 books have been sold or provided to our clients.
 
Managed Facility Services
 
As we have grown the volume of requests from clients and prospective clients for full facility management has increased. As a result, we have structured a service offering to include organizational setup and interim management of client’s cultivation, processing, and dispensary facility(s). As part of the managed facilities services, we may provide the following:

1. | Oversee the hiring and training of the primary facility General Manager. This General Manager will oversee the hiring and training of market-based Cultivation Manager, Production Manager, and Dispensary Manager, as necessary, who may all train on-site in Colorado while client facilities are under construction.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Provide organizational charts and job descriptions to aid client management team in hiring within their local market. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. | If desired, embed a Senior Cultivation Team Member within the client’s facility for a defined period of time, beginning at a time mutually determined between us and the client. Upon completion of the service agreement, opportunity for full-time employment is typically made available to client.


4. | If desired, embed a Senior Processing Team Member within the client’s facility for a defined period of time, beginning at a time mutually determined between us and the client. Upon completion of the service agreement, opportunity for full-time employment is typically made available to client.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | If desired, embed a Senior Dispensary Team Member within the client’s facility for a defined period of time, beginning at a time mutually determined between us and the client. Upon completion of the service agreement, opportunity for full-time employment is typically made available to client.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | All costs for the above services to be covered by the client including time and expense.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Revenue for managed services is derived on a fee basis for ongoing support and also incentivized by production metrics tied to overall facility performance. These services are typically provided through a custom assessment and bidding process.

GROUP 2 – Nutrients and other Products
 
Success Nutrients 
 
Success Nutrients was incorporated in Colorado on May 5, 2015. Since inception it has been engaged in the manufacturing and wholesale and retail distribution of nine different plant nutrients for cannabis, each of which comes in three separate sizes and which has been primarily marketed to the cannabis industry, more specifically, cultivation experts and other growers in the cannabis industry in Colorado. Each of its nine product lines are sold in three separate sizes, with retail pricing ranging from $25-$30 for small packages up to a range of $200-$400 for large packages.
 
The development of Success Nutrients product line was the result of consolidation of all the micro and macro nutrients found to produce the most grams of cannabis flower per square foot while achieving the highest quality possible. Until January 2017, operations were primarily directed towards the cannabis industry in the state of Colorado. Subsequently, Success Nutrient’s products were successfully registered with the state agricultural departments for California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona and Michigan, as well as in Canada. Prior to obtaining this registration these products were only able to be purchased online. As a result of being registered, all Success Nutrients products can now be displayed on retail shelves in those aforesaid states. We will continue to pursue product registration in other states and countries prioritizing those locations that provide greater market size for these products.
 
The Success Nutrients brand provides one of the key underpinnings of the cultivation methodology and is essential to the overall Three A Light TM performance metric, which is discussed more fully below under “Business of Pono.” With an investment of two years of research, development and intense testing, this product line was specifically formulated for the cannabis industry.
 
Our goal is to revolutionize modern cannabis gardening as it is currently known with an emphasis on stronger plants, healthy flowers and an overall cleaner product. Generally, growers of cannabis have been able to generate per grow light. By using both the nutrients offered by Success Nutrients, together with the process offered by Pono, results have more than doubled in some cases. While no assurances can be provided that we will be able to duplicate these results, if successful we believe that this will add substantial growth to our existing cannabis consulting operation, especially as the cannabis industry continues to grow and expand as additional states approve the use and cultivation of medical and recreational marijuana. We believe that if we offer prospective new clients the opportunity to learn cultivation techniques that allow them to increase production over their competitors, our business will increase. As explained above, the combination of Success Nutrients and Pono techniques has directly resulted in the creation of a new line of consulting services that improve the performance of current cultivations.
 
The Big Tomato Hydroponics Retail
 
Two JS LLC, dba The Big Tomato operates a retail location in Aurora, CO. It has been a leading supplier of hydroponics & indoor gardening supplies in Denver, Colorado and the surrounding communities since May 2001. It has established a reputation as a store that is fully stocked, has great pricing and has a very knowledgeable staff. It has continued to provide thousands of indoor gardeners and commercial growers with top quality hydroponic supplies at the best prices. The store maintains an extremely large inventory of hydroponic and gardening supplies. Big Tomato’s new website, TheBigTomato.com was created for the discriminating indoor gardener who is looking for reliable gardening help and customer service while at the same time enjoying the great savings on the products they want to purchase. The website is supported by the company’s brick-and-mortar store located in Aurora, Colorado. Every sales staff member is an experienced grower that is trained to service customers and answer any questions. Products include indoor gardening products, grow boxes, grow lights, hydroponic systems, ballasts, bulbs, nutrients and additives, and other high-end hydroponic items.
 
By acquiring this business division, the company expects it will be able to increase the lifetime value of each consulting company significantly. In addition, to providing consulting to our client base we will be able to not only sell them nutrient products but also many of the other items needed to operate their grow to our specifications.

GROUP 3 – Direct Cannabis Operations
 
On January 10, 2019 the company announced that it would be moving into direct plant touching operations as the laws in Colorado change to allow these acquisitions to take place. It is expected that a significant portion of the company’s growth in the coming years will be derived from these operations. There were no revenues generated from this operation.
MARKETING
 
We conduct our marketing efforts by providing a presence at specifically targeted industry-based events, as well as through Medicine Man Denver’s and Super Farm’s established industry presence as a successful cannabis company and as such, we have been able to garner a substantial presence via this relationship. Because the cannabis industry is relatively new, there are very few groups and companies who can identify themselves as having actual past as well as ongoing industry experience, so we feel we will continue to be at the top of that list as a result of our management’s experience with all aspects of the industry. See “Part II Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
 
We are members of various industry groups and attend industry-based conferences which are helpful to advancing our brand and skill sets. We created a marketing collateral materials bank and attended our first true marketing event in November 2014 at the Third National CannaBusiness Conference and Expo in Las Vegas and have continued to remain as Platinum Level Sponsors of those two events annually. The fall event this year (2017) held at the Las Vegas Convention Center was the largest Cannabis event ever offered here in the US, drawing approximately 18,000 participants. We will continue to market our licensing and related services to the cannabis industry through participation in various trade show events, continual use of free public content through interviews with our principals such as currently provided on CNN and MSNBC, direct referrals from satisfied licensees or past clients, various web presence advertising options utilizing specific industry related web sites and google ad words, and additional measures we may choose to deploy from time to time.
 
We also continue to coalesce interest and a presence within the industry through participation in various events and through direct promotion which have become available to Medicine Man and the Williams family, including being featured in MSNBC’s ‘Pot Barons’ series and detailed inclusion in other outlets such as MSNBC, Inc. Magazine, Katie Couric Live, The Today Show, the BBC, CBS, NBC, LeMonde, ABC, HBO, and many other national and international media. We work to continually develop earned media sources noting elements of our licensor, Medicine Man Denver have been mentioned or featured in various national media sources many times since our inception in March 2014. In addition, members of our team are featured regularly as subject-matter experts and appear as guest speakers; industry panel discussion members; and have been quoted or covered in full-feature articles in publications in both the U.S. and abroad. In addition to other national and industry publications, our professionals have most recently been quoted in US News and World Report, Inc. Magazine, CBE Press, and MJ Business Daily.
 
Joshua Haupt, via his Success Nutrients line as well as Pono Publications (Three-A-Light) has also been featured in many trade publications as well as at various cultivation show events nationally and has more recently been referred to as the ‘Steve Jobs’ of Marijuana (Civilized, Dope and High Times Magazines). His experience underscored by passion has allowed him to become one of the most prolific cultivators of cannabis in the country. More information about his businesses can be found at either www.threealight.com or www.successnutrients.com.
 
As we grow and mature with the cannabis industry we believe we will continue to identify new opportunities to expand our service offering groups. We are already working in harmony with other consultants within the industry who lack certain experience or skills through licensure of specific cultivation technologies, with specific protections and non-disclosure agreements in place. We do not provide our operations manual of training to potential licensees until they have a state granted license in place.

We continue to enhance our web presence (http://www.medicinemantechnologies.com/), including providing updates to our home page, and links to our SEC reports (through OTC Markets) and industry partners. While no assurances can be provided, we believe these upgrades will make our Internet presence more effective in the delivery of information related to our developing business.
 
We also intend to evaluate new business opportunities as they come to our attention through these various marketing activities as we continue to expand our brand warehouse and national presence in the cannabis industry. See “Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 
GROWTH BY ACQUISITION 
 
As described above, we have successfully completed the recent acquisitions of Pono Publications (Three-A-Light), Success Nutrients, and the Denver Consulting Group and are actively seeking other opportunities that fit within our general business strategy.
 
Ultimately, our intent is to become both a nationally (mid-term goal) and internationally (longer term goal) recognized cannabis consulting company as well as a fully vertically integrated multistate cannabis operator.
 
We also plan to grow through the acquisition of related, complimentary businesses. In doing so we expect to increase revenues and profits by providing a broader range of services in vertical markets which are consolidated under one parent, thus realizing synergies between the brands to increase sales on multiple fronts; reducing overhead costs by streamlining operations; and eliminating duplicitous efforts and costs. There are no assurances that we will increase profitability if we are successful in acquiring other synergistic companies.
 
Management continues to seek out and evaluate related, complimentary businesses for acquisition. The integrity and reputation of any potential acquisition candidate will first be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it meets with management’s standards. Once targeted as a potential acquisition candidate, we will enter into negotiations with the potential candidate and commence due diligence evaluation, including its financial statements, cash flow, debt, location and other material aspects of the candidate’s business. If we are successful in our attempts to acquire synergistic companies utilizing our securities as part or all of the consideration to be paid, our current shareholders will incur dilution. 
 
In implementing a structure for a particular acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business.
 
As part of our investigation, our officers and directors will meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an acquisition will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of us and other parties, the management of the acquisition candidate and our relative negotiation strength.
 
We will participate in an acquisition only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms.

Depending upon the nature of the acquisition, including the financial condition of the acquisition company, as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “34 Act”), it may be necessary for such acquisition candidate to provide independent audited financial statements. If so required, we will not acquire any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to ensure our compliance with the requirements of the 34 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the candidate to be acquired in the closing documents, the closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the agreement will also contain a provision providing for the acquisition entity to reimburse us for all costs associated with the proposed transaction.
 
ADDITIONAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES
 
The cannabis industry is developing rapidly. As it continues to develop we believe additional business opportunities will arise.
 
Recently the Company agreed to support the possible deployment of certain new regulations in Colorado related to public company holding of Cannabis related licenses. To this end we have engaged several various resources for support of this initiative and expect that any final resolution of passage of this legislation (HB 19-1090) to occur no later than May of 2019. Should this initiative be successful we expect to explore several opportunities within Colorado for potential alignment, acquisition, consulting services, or other options related to our potential for growth in the future. There are no assurances this legislation will be adopted.
 
In January 2019 the company entered into a letter of intent to acquire business assets that are partially owned by the Williams family, as disclosed in prior filings pending HB 19-1090 being passed, while there can be no assurances that any particular piece of legislation will pass the Company is hopeful that this acquisition will proceed.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states where the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws. Those federal prohibitions not withstanding there are a number of US marijuana companies listed on by the OTC Market, e.g. Terra Tech Corp. symbol TRTC.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.”
 
As of the date of this report, 33 states allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana, with Utah and Missouri being the most recent states to add medical regulation. Additionally, voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Michigan, and the District of Columbia have all approved legalization of cannabis for adult use. The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws will cause significant financial damage to us.
 
Globally 31 countries allow the use of medical marijuana and two of those countries have fully legalized marijuana, Canada and Uruguay. Global opening of marijuana markets is trending globally.

In a Forbes article, United States Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, testified stating, “…Mnuchin confirmed that the department is "reviewing the existing guidance." But he clarified that he doesn't want to rescind it without having an alternate policy in place to address public safety concerns. A link to the article is below.
 
https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/02/06/trump-treasury-secretary-wants-marijuana-money-in-banks/#7dd96a9a3a53
 
Previously, the Obama administration took the position that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The Trump administration has revised this policy. Specifically, the Attorney General rescinded the Cole Memorandum in favor of deferral of any enforcement of federal regulation to the individual states Department of Justice/US Attorney. However, certain other protections remain in place via budgetary element embedment (Rohrabacher-Farr amendment now referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment), which limits funding of any enforcement of anti-cannabis legislation. The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substance Act with respect to marijuana to prevent:
 

· | the distribution of marijuana to minors;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the growing of marijuana on public lands; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------
· | marijuana possession or use on federal property. 

 
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, federally chartered banks must follow the FINCEN guidelines when baking the marijuana industry companies. This adds risk and expense for the banks that most are unwilling to bare. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The difficulty opening bank accounts may make it difficult for our clients and MMT to operate. MMT currently has bank accounts with banks that do follow the FINCEN guidelines and we anticipate this banking relationship to continue. There does appears to be recent legislative movement at the Federal level to open banking further for the marijuana industry. The House Financial Services Committee recently voted 45 to 15 to advance legislation titled, “SAFE Banking Act” (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr1595), to the full House body. If signed into law, the “Safe Banking Act” will create protections for depository institutions that provide financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses and service providers for such businesses, and for other purposes.

Of broader reach than the SAFE Banking Act, on April 4, 2019, a bipartisan team of legislators re-introduced companion versions of the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (the “STATES Act”) (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3032/all-info) in both the Senate and the House. The STATES Act would amend the Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) to restrict federal enforcement against state-legal cannabis activity. In particular, the bill prevents the application of the Controlled Substances Act to individuals or companies acting in compliance with state law relating to the manufacture, production, possession, distribution, dispensation, administration, or delivery of marijuana. In addition, the law would prevent forfeiture of any assets derived from state-legal marijuana business and would exempt state-legal marijuana business from the definition of “specified proceeds of illegal activity” under the money laundering laws. In announcing the bill, Rep. David Joyce said that “current federal policy interferes with the ability of states to implement their own cannabis laws, and the resulting system has stifled important medical research, hurt legitimate businesses and diverted critical law enforcement resources needed elsewhere.” The STATES Act was introduced in Congress in 2018, and President Trump commented that he would “probably end up supporting that” despite the well-known opposition of his then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The STATES Act would be a significant step toward eliminating the issues posed by dueling federal and state law with regard to cannabis. Not only does the STATES Act provide that the CSA is inapplicable to state-legal cannabis activities, it would make clear that federal money laundering and asset forfeiture laws are inapplicable to funds derived from state-legal cannabis activities. If enacted, this law would go further than any other bill introduced to date, including the SAFE Act, to remove the significant hurdles that exist for state-compliant businesses and individuals to expand their cannabis businesses.
 
Although cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in many states, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plan and could expose us and our management to potential criminal liability and subject their properties to civil forfeiture. Though the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the House Appropriations Committee approved, by a bipartisan voice vote, an amendment by Rep. David Joyce, an Ohio Republican and former prosecutor, to attach the medical marijuana protections to the FY2019 Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill. The provision – previously called the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment and, before that, Rohrabacher-Farr – prohibits the Justice Department from using funds to interfere with state medical marijuana programs or to prosecute MMJ businesses compliant with those state laws.
 
In order to participate in either the medical or recreational sides of the marijuana industry in Colorado and elsewhere, all businesses and employees must obtain licenses from the state and, for businesses, local jurisdictions. Colorado issues six types of business licenses including cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, transport, research license and testing. In addition, all owners and employees must obtain an occupational license to be permitted to own or work in a facility. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.
 
Colorado has also enacted stringent regulations governing the facilities and operations of marijuana businesses. All facilities are required to be licensed by the state and local authorities and are subject to comprehensive security and surveillance requirements. In addition, each facility is subject to extensive regulations that govern its businesses practices, which includes mandatory seed-to-sale tracking and reporting, health and sanitary standards, packaging and labeling requirements, and product testing for potency and contaminants.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on its business.
 
Over the past three years, MMT has supported legislation in Colorado to allow licensed cannabis companies in Colorado to trade their securities, provided they are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. HB19-1090 (https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb19-1090) titled, “Publicly Licensed Marijuana Companies” is currently under consideration in the Colorado legislature. The bill, if signed into law, repeals the provision that prohibits publicly traded corporations from holding a marijuana license in Colorado. MMT has taken action to help to lead and support this bill. We expect a decision to occur on this legislation by the beginning of May 2019. Should this legislation be adopted we intend to acquire cannabis licensed companies within Colorado, provide to them consulting services, and/or other opportunities. There are no assurances this legislation will be adopted.

As of the date of this report, we employ twenty-five (25) full time employees and a number of specialty contractors providing support for various elements including media, marketing, state registration of nutrient products, website evolution and new app development.
 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
    COMPETITION
 
We face competition from an ever-increasing number of consulting service providers in the cannabis industry. We currently known professionally of at least twenty plus such providers in this space, not including law firms and other professional entities. We are continually monitoring their progress and presence in the industry while working to continue to demonstrate our unique licensing offering.
 
There are many sources of competitive influencers, one such aggregator of such lists, Marijuana Business Daily, shows about 620 various consultants in the industry within the United States (https://industrydirectory.mjbizdaily.com/consultant-services). 
 
TRADEMARKS - TRADENAMES
 
We rely upon our various trademark, trade name, and intellectual property of our license partner Medicine Man Denver and will, in the future and as appropriate, develop such elements as we may determine valuable to our business. We also acknowledge that certain protections normally available to us related to design or other utility patents in the cannabis industry would not currently be enforceable under federal law. We attempt to protect our intellectual property via the deployment of non-disclosure agreements with both prospects and licensees. There are no assurances that these non-disclosure agreements will prevent a third party from infringing upon our rights.
 
Pono and SNI uses a combination of copyright, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect its proprietary intellectual property. We intend to aggressively register for patent protection if and when the federal government eliminates cannabis prohibition. Intellectual property counsel has advised that any effort to register a patent relating to the cultivation of marijuana would currently be unsuccessful. (See Item 3)
 
INDUSTRY ANALYSIS
 
Nationally, the industry has continued to gain ground through the addition of many states and their passing of medical and or recreational provisions for the use of cannabis. While there certainly appears to be a trend towards acceptance of cannabis, there are no assurances offered that this business will be able to sustain itself over time if the Federal Government changes its current position related to state legalized operations.
 
In November 2018, the addition of eight (3) new states passing either a medical or adult use initiative pushes the number of states having active cannabis-based legislation up to thirty-three (33) and District of Columbia noting ten (10) of these states now include adult use components.
 
While there have been many observations and prognostications relative to the recent elections, there has been no specific laws passed by the federal government to change the federal prohibition of marijuana.
 
In Colorado the state has continued to set new sales growth-related records, generating about $1.54B in gross sales in FY 2018; up from the $1.51B recorded in FY 2017 noting much of those sales were related to adult use and the robust tourist industry. It is noteworthy that these record sales occurred in a marketplace where the overall wholesale price market has experienced a significant drop off since the initiation of adult sales in early 2014. Wholesale flower has dropped from a high in early 2014 of $4,000+ a pound to approximately $1,000 a pound (indoor, 2018).

While no assurances can be provided, we believe that over the next three to five years there will be as many additional states adopting various types of cannabis legislation (medical and/or adult use) and if this happens, we believe that there will occur a certain tipping point by which the Federal Government will have to take some sort of stand on the legal status of cannabis. We also believe that due to the strong growth in the industry as a whole at the state level, the Federal Government will eventually de-schedule cannabis, similar to the alcoholic beverage prohibition repeal in the mid 1930’s, and as motivated by its citizenry decriminalize cannabis and regulate it under the auspices of some existing or newly formed agency.
