ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. Actual results and the timing of the events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Diego, California, focused on identifying, developing and delivering life-changing therapies to people living with rare diseases. Our approach centers on our pipeline with multiple late clinical-stage programs targeting rare diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Our research and development efforts are supported by revenues from our commercialized products, Chenodal®, Cholbam® and Thiola®. In addition we regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, act on opportunities to expand our product pipeline through licenses and acquisitions of products in areas that will serve patients with serious or rare diseases and that we believe offer attractive growth characteristics.
We currently have the following product candidates in clinical development:
Fosmetpantotenate (RE-024)
Fosmetpantotenate, also known as RE-024, is a novel small molecule being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical study as a potential treatment for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (“PKAN”). PKAN is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that is typically diagnosed in the first decade of life. Symptoms of PKAN include dystonia, dysarthria, rigidity, retinal degeneration, and severe digestive problems. 
Sparsentan (RE-021)
Sparsentan, also known as RE-021, is an investigational product candidate with a dual mechanism of action, a potent angiotensin receptor blocker (“ARB”) and selective endothelin receptor antagonist (“ERA”), with in vitro selectivity toward endothelin receptor type A. We have secured a license to sparsentan from Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS") (who referred to it as DARA). Sparsentan is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies in the following indications:

• | Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ("FSGS") is a rare kidney disease characterized by proteinuria where the glomeruli become progressively scarred. FSGS is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease.


• | Immunoglobulin A nephropathy ("IgAN") is an immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritis characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, and variable rates of progressive renal failure. IgAN is the most common primary glomerular disease.

CNSA-001
We have entered into a joint development agreement with Censa Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("Censa"), a privately held biotechnology company focused on developing therapies for orphan metabolic diseases, to evaluate CNSA-001 for the treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU). CNSA-001 is an orally bioavailable proprietary form of sepiapterin, a natural precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) that is converted by an endogenous enzymatic pathway to BH4. CNSA-001 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in patients with PKU.
In addition, we also have the following programs in discovery or development:
NGLY1 Deficiency Discovery Efforts
N-glycanase deficiency, or NGLY1 deficiency, is an extremely rare genetic disorder believed to be caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called N-glycanase-1, which is encoded by the gene NGLY1. In September 2017, we entered into a three-way Cooperative Research and Development Agreement ("CRADA") with the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and patient advocacy foundation NGLY1.org to collaborate on research efforts aimed at the identification of potential small molecule therapeutics for NGLY1 deficiency.

Liquid Ursodeoxycholic Acid
Liquid ursodeoxycholic acid ("L-UDCA") is a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid being developed for the treatment of a rare liver disease called primary biliary cholangitis ("PBC"). We obtained rights to L-UDCA in 2016 with the intention of making L-UDCA commercially available to the subset of PBC patients who have difficulty swallowing. There are no liquid formulations of ursodeoxycholic acid currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
We currently sell the following three products:

• | Chenodal® (chenodeoxycholic acid) is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients suffering from gallstones in whom surgery poses an unacceptable health risk due to disease or advanced age. Chenodal® has also been the standard of care for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (“CTX”) patients for more than three decades and we are currently pursuing adding this indication to the label.


• | Cholbam® (cholic acid) is approved in the United States for the treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects and is further indicated for adjunctive treatment of patients with certain peroxisomal disorders.


• | Thiola® (tiopronin) is approved in the United States for the prevention of cystine (kidney) stone formation in patients with severe homozygous cystinuria.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a preeminent, global and fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company within the rare disease community. In order to achieve our goal, we intend to:

• | Focus on developing products to treat rare diseases characterized by severe unmet medical needs. We believe that our research, development, and commercialization capabilities in rare disease represent distinct competitive advantages. We leverage our development capabilities in rare disease to focus on advancing therapeutic candidates with life-changing potential. Given these capabilities, the well-established regulatory model and the ability to demonstrate clinical effects in small clinical studies, we believe that we can successfully bring new therapies to patients living with severe unmet medical needs.


• | Develop a sustainable pipeline by employing disciplined decision criteria in the evaluation of potential in-licensing candidates. We seek to build a sustainable product pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and by developing or acquiring orphan drug candidates. We seek to augment our internally developed pipeline projects by selectively and strategically acquiring pipeline assets that will add value to the portfolio. We intend to mitigate risk by employing rigorous decision criteria, favoring drug candidates that have undergone at least some clinical study. Our decision to acquire rights to a drug candidate also depends on the scientific merits of the available clinical data; the identifiable orphan patient population; the economic terms of any proposed acquisition of rights; the projected amount of capital required to develop the drug candidate; and the economic potential of the drug candidate, should it be commercialized. We believe this strategy minimizes our clinical development risk and allows us to accelerate the development and potential commercialization of current and future drug candidates.


• | Evaluate the commercialization strategies on a product-by-product basis to maximize the value of each. As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several options for each drug candidate’s commercialization strategy. These options include utilizing or expanding our own internal sales force; entering into joint marketing partnerships with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing our products, whereby other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies sell and market our product and pay us a royalty on sales. Our decision will be made separately for each product and will be based on a number of factors including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

Our Product Candidates and Products on the Market
 The following table summarizes the status of our product candidates, preclinical programs and products on the market, each of which is described in further detail below.
*CNSA-001 is being developed in a strategic collaboration with Censa Pharmaceuticals.
**Activities underway with the intention of making a liquid formulation commercially available in the United States.
Product Candidates:
Fosmetpantotenate
We are developing fosmetpantotenate, a novel small molecule, as a potential treatment for PKAN. PKAN is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder that is typically diagnosed in the first decade of life. Symptoms of PKAN include dystonia, dysarthria, rigidity, retinal degeneration, and severe digestive problems. PKAN is estimated to affect up to 5,000 patients worldwide. There are currently no viable treatment options for patients with PKAN. Fosmetpantotenate is a phosphopantothenate replacement therapy that aims to restore levels of this key substrate in PKAN patients. Certain international health regulators have approved the initiation of dosing fosmetpantotenate in PKAN patients under physician-initiated studies in accordance with local regulations in their respective countries.
In 2015 and 2016 we filed a U.S. Investigational New Drug application ("IND"), completed the Phase I clinical trials and obtained both orphan drug and fast track designation in the United States. Additionally, we received orphan drug designation in the European Union and reached an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) process for a Phase 3 clinical trial for PKAN.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the pivotal Phase 3 FORT Study of fosmetpantotenate in PKAN completed patient enrollment. The FORT Study is designed to be registration-enabling in the U.S. and Europe, and we expect top-line data to become available in the third quarter of 2019.
Sparsentan
Sparsentan is an investigational product candidate with a dual mechanism of action, a potent ARB and selective ERA, with in vitro selectivity toward endothelin receptor type A. We have secured a license to sparsentan from Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and BMS (who referred to it as DARA).  Sparsentan is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies in the following indications:
7


• | FSGS, a leading cause of end-stage renal disease and nephrotic syndrome (“NS”). There are currently no FDA approved pharmacologic treatments for FSGS and off-label treatments are limited to ACE/ARBs, steroids, and immunosuppressant agents, which are effective in only a subset of patients. Every year approximately 5,400 patients are diagnosed with FSGS and we estimate that there are up to 40,000 FSGS patients in the United States with approximately half of them being candidates for sparsentan. In 2015 and 2016 we received orphan drug designation in the United States and European Union and generated positive data from our Phase 2 DUET study of sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS. In the second quarter of 2018, we announced the initiation of the Phase 3 DUPLEX Study of sparsentan in FSGS, and enrollment continues. This pivotal DUPLEX Study is designed to include an interim analysis of modified partial remission of proteinuria. We expect that successful achievement of this endpoint will serve as the basis for submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) for sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS under the Subpart H accelerated approval pathway in the United States and Conditional Marketing Authorization ("CMA") consideration in Europe. The confirmatory endpoint of the study will compare changes in slope of estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. Top-line data from the interim analysis are expected to become available in the second half of 2020. 


• | IgAN is characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, and variable rates of progressive renal failure. With an estimated prevalence of more than 100,000 people in the United States and greater numbers in Europe and Asia, IgAN is the most common primary glomerular disease. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 35, with up to 40% progressing to end stage renal disease within 15 years. There are currently no FDA approved treatments for IgAN. The current standard of care is renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with immunosuppression also being commonly used for patients with significant proteinuria or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in the PROTECT Study, a global, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the long-term nephroprotective potential of sparsentan for the treatment of IgAN. This PROTECT Study is a global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-arm, active-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of sparsentan in approximately 280 patients with IgAN aged 18 years or older. The primary efficacy endpoint in the PROTECT Study is the change in proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio) from baseline after 36 weeks of treatment. We expect that successful achievement of this endpoint will serve as the basis for submission of an NDA for sparsentan for the treatment of IgAN under the Subpart H accelerated approval pathway in the U.S. and CMA consideration in Europe. Secondary efficacy endpoints include change in eGFR from baseline to four weeks post-cessation of randomized treatment, as well as the rate of change in eGFR over 52-week and 104-week periods following the first six weeks of randomized treatment. Top-line data from the primary endpoint are expected to become available in the first half of 2022.

CNSA-001
We are a party to a joint development agreement with Censa, a privately held biotechnology company focused on developing therapies for orphan metabolic diseases, to evaluate CNSA-001 for the treatment of PKU. CNSA-001 is an orally available, natural precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) with the potential to provide improved phenylalanine (Phe) reduction in patients with PKU when compared to BH4.
PKU is a rare, genetic metabolic condition in which the body cannot breakdown Phe due to a missing or defective phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. High Phe levels can lead to developmental and physical growth delay, executive function impairment, seizures, and microcephaly caused by toxic Phe accumulation in the brain. PKU is typically diagnosed at birth.
Under the terms of the agreement, we are providing funding for the development of CNSA-001 in PKU. Censa is responsible for the development program, which is being conducted under the oversight of a joint steering committee. As part of the agreement, we owe certain milestone payments upon achievement of specified milestones and we have the exclusive option to acquire Censa upon conclusion of a specified option period, pending clinical proof of concept of CNSA-001 in PKU.
Censa is currently conducting a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating CNSA-001 in patients with PKU and we expect top-line data to become available to us during the second quarter of 2019.
NGLY1 Deficiency Discovery Efforts
NGLY1 deficiency, is an extremely rare genetic disorder believed to be caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called N-glycanase-1, which is encoded by the gene NGLY1. The condition is characterized by symptoms such as developmental delays, seizures, complex hyperkinetic movement disorders, diminished reflexes and an inability to produce tears. There are no approved therapeutic options for NGLY1 deficiency, and current therapeutic strategies are limited to symptom management.
In September 2017, we entered into a three-way CRADA with the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and patient advocacy foundation NGLY1.org to collaborate on research efforts aimed at the identification of potential small molecule therapeutics for NGLY1 deficiency.
Liquid Ursodeoxycholic Acid
L-UDCA is a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid being developed for the treatment of a rare liver disease called PBC. We obtained rights to L-UDCA in 2016 with the intention of making L-UDCA commercially available to the subset of PBC patients who have difficulty swallowing. There are no liquid formulations of ursodeoxycholic acid currently approved by the FDA.

Products on the Market:
Chenodal (chenodiol tablets)
Chenodal is a synthetic oral form of chenodeoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring primary bile acid synthesized from cholesterol in the liver, indicated for the treatment of radiolucent stones in well-opacifying gallbladders in patients in whom selective surgery would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease or age.
Chenodal administration is known to reduce biliary cholesterol and the dissolution of radiolucent gallstones through suppression of hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, cholic acid and deoxycholic acid in the bile pool. Chenodal was first approved by the FDA in 1983 for the management of gallstones but its marketing was later discontinued due to lack of commercial success. In 2009, Nexgen Pharma Inc.'s Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") for Chenodal was approved by the FDA for the treatment of gallstones. Chenodal is manufactured under this ANDA. In 2010, Chenodal was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of CTX, a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disease. We acquired Chenodal in March 2014. 
While Chenodal is not labeled for CTX, it has been used as the standard of care for over three decades. We are working to obtain FDA approval of Chenodal for the treatment of CTX. The prevalence of CTX is estimated in the literature to be as high as 1 in 70,000 in the overall population. Pathogenesis of CTX involves deficiency of the enzyme 27-hydroxylase (encoded by the gene CYP27A1), a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of primary bile acids, including chenodeoxycholic acid ("CDCA"), from cholesterol. The disruption of primary bile acid synthesis in CTX leads to toxic accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in most tissues. Most patients present with intractable diarrhea, premature cataracts, tendon xanthomas, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease in childhood and adolescence. Neurological manifestations of the disease, including dementia and cognitive and cerebellar deficiencies, emerge during late adolescence and adulthood. Oral administration of CDCA has been shown to normalize primary bile acid synthesis in patients with CTX.
Cholbam (cholic acid capsules)
The FDA approved Cholbam (cholic acid capsules) in March 2015, the first FDA approved treatment for pediatric and adult patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for adjunctive treatment of patients with peroxisomal disorders (including Zellweger spectrum disorders).  The effectiveness of Cholbam has been demonstrated in clinical trials for bile acid synthesis disorders and the adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders. An estimated 200 to 300 patients are current candidates for therapy.
Kolbam, the branded name of Cholbam in Europe, is indicated in Europe for the treatment of certain inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, encompassing select single enzyme defects, in infants from one month of age for continuous lifelong treatment through adulthood.
Thiola (tiopronin tablets)
Thiola is approved by the FDA for the treatment of cystinuria, a rare genetic cystine transport disorder that causes high cystine levels in the urine and the formation of recurring kidney stones. The resulting long-term damage can cause loss of kidney function in addition to substantial pain and loss of productivity associated with renal colic and stone passage. The prevalence of cystinuria in the United States is estimated to be 10,000 to 12,000, indicating that there may be as many as 4,000 to 5,000 affected individuals with cystinuria in the United States that would be candidates for Thiola. An NDA has been filed for a new, more patient-friendly, formulation of Thiola and the FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") target action date of June 30, 2019.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Many of our competitors are larger than our company and have substantially greater financial, marketing and technical resources than we have.
The development and commercialization of new products to treat orphan diseases is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. As a result, there are, and will likely continue to be, extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new orphan drug products. 
Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. The speed with which we can develop products, complete pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, approval processes, and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, reimbursement, patent position, and regulatory exclusivity.
Chenodal
There are other non-approved chenodeoxycholic acid products available outside of the United States. Furthermore, Chenodal is subject to immediate competition from compounded and generic entrants, as the ANDA for this drug has no remaining patent or nonpatent exclusivity.
Cholbam
There are currently no FDA approved treatments in the United States that compete with Cholbam.
Thiola
D-penicillamine agents, including Cuprimine® and Depen® are FDA approved for the treatment of cystinuria, as well as Wilson’s Disease. Additional generic versions of D-penicillamine may become FDA-approved and enter the market. 
9

Captopril is not FDA approved for the treatment of cystinuria but has been prescribed for patients with cystinuria. 
In 2016, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company, announced plans to introduce a compounded form of tiopronin, the active ingredient in Thiola, in combination with potassium citrate.  Compounded therapies are not subjected to the same level of safety and efficacy evaluation and may not offer the same therapeutic outcome for patients. There is no clinical data to support the compatibility of fixed dosing of tiopronin with potassium citrate. Fixed-dose combinations of therapies containing potassium are generally avoided due to the potential for fluctuations in serum potassium, which may cause serious adverse outcomes including cardiac events.
Revive Therapeutics is developing bucillamine, a dithiol derivative of tiopronin for the treatment of cystinuria. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation for the use of bucillamine for the treatment of cystinuria.
Furthermore, Thiola is subject to immediate competition from compounded and generic entrants, as the NDA for this drug has no remaining patent or nonpatent exclusivity.
Fosmetpantotenate
Based on industry reports, Apo Pharma, CoA Therapeutics, Spoonbill Foundation together with Oregon Health & Science University, and TM3 Therapeutics may have programs in pre-clinical or clinical development for the treatment of PKAN.
Sparsentan
There are currently no pharmacological treatments approved by the FDA for FSGS or IgAN in Europe or the United States. For FSGS the current standard of care includes steroids, ACE/ARBs, calcineurin inhibitors, dialysis, and renal transplant. For IgAN, the current standard of care is renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with immunosuppression also being commonly used in patients with significant proteinuria or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. 
Based on industry reports, Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Complexia Inc., Dimerix Bioscience, ChemoCentryx, BMS, Pfizer, and Reata Pharmaceuticals may have programs in clinical development for the treatment of FSGS.
Based on industry reports, Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Calliditas Therapeutics, Merck, Novartis, Omeros Corporation, and Reata Pharmaceuticals may have programs in clinical development for the treatment of IgAN.
In addition there are several other pre-clinical programs that may enter the clinic for the treatment of IgAN.
CNSA-001
We have the option to purchase Censa, which owns CNSA-001. The current competitive landscape for CNSA-001 includes:

• | Two FDA- approved medications for PKU which are marketed by BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, sapropterin dihydrochloride, known as Kuvan® and pegylated recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase, known as PALYNZIQ™.


• | Various preclinical programs which include gene-therapy projects for PKU.

Liquid Ursodeoxycholic Acid
Also known as ursodiol or UDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid derived from cholesterol, which is indicated for the treatment of PBC and currently prescribed only in solid forms. Introducing a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid would provide healthcare professionals with a dosing alternative for patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules, and may facilitate increased compliance. Currently the only liquid form of UDCA is from compounding pharmacies who make it at a physician's request for individual prescriptions.
Our significant recent business development activities include:
Exclusive option to purchase Censa
On December 16, 2017, we entered into a Future Acquisition Right and Joint Development Agreement with Censa, which became effective on January 4, 2018. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to fund certain development activities of Censa’s CNSA-001 program, in an aggregate amount expected to be approximately $17 million through proof of concept, and have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire Censa (the “Option”) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a separate Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”). In exchange for the Option, in January 2018, we paid Censa $10 million, $9 million of which was distributed to Censa’s equityholders, and paid Censa an additional $5 million upon Censa’s completion of a specified development milestone set forth in the Option Agreement, all of which was distributed to Censa’s equityholders.
If we exercise the Option, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will acquire Censa for $65 million in upfront consideration, subject to certain adjustments, paid as a combination of 20% in cash and 80% in shares of our common stock, valued at a fixed price of $21.40 per share; provided, however, that Censa may elect on behalf of its equityholders to receive the upfront consideration in 100% cash if the average price per share of our common stock for the ten trading days ending on the date we provide a notice of interest to exercise the Option is less than $19.26. In addition to the upfront consideration, if we exercise the Option and acquire Censa, we would be required to make further cash payments to Censa’s equityholders of up to an aggregate of $25 million if the CNSA-001 program achieves specified development and commercial milestones.
10

Licenses and Royalties
Ligand License Agreement
In 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Ligand"), granting us a worldwide license for the development, manufacture and commercialization of sparsentan, which we are developing for the treatment of FSGS and IgAN. Under the license agreement, Ligand granted us a sublicense under certain of its patents and other intellectual property in connection with the development and commercialization of sparsentan. Under the license agreement, Ligand is obligated to transfer to us certain information, records, regulatory filings, materials and inventory controlled by Ligand and relating to or useful for developing sparsentan. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize sparsentan in specified major market countries and other countries in which we believe it is commercially reasonable to develop and commercialize such products.
As consideration for the license, we are required to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, totaling up to $114.1 million. Should we commercialize sparsentan or any products containing any of the licensed compounds, we will be obligated to pay Ligand an escalating annual royalty between 15% and 17% of net sales of all such products. Through 2018, we have made milestone payments to Ligand of $7.2 million under the terms of the license agreement.
Under the terms of the license agreement, BMS has a right of first negotiation and Ligand has a right of second negotiation with respect to any license arrangement for a licensed compound except to the extent such rights may be waived.
The license agreement will continue until neither party has any further payment obligations under the agreement and is expected to continue for approximately 10 to 20 years from the effective date. Ligand may terminate the license agreement due to (i) our insolvency, (ii) our material uncured breach of the agreement, (iii) our failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize sparsentan as described above or (iv) certain other conditions. We may terminate the license agreement due to a material uncured breach of the agreement by Ligand.
Thiola License Agreement
In 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Mission Pharmacal Company ("Mission"), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market, sell and commercialize Thiola (Tiopronin) in the United States and Canada, and a non-exclusive license to use know-how relating to Thiola to the extent necessary to market Thiola. We paid Mission an up-front license fee of $3.0 million and through May 28, 2024 will pay guaranteed minimum royalties during each calendar year the greater of $2.0 million or 20% of our net sales of Thiola in the United States and Canada. 
Amendments to the original license agreement are as follows: In October 2015, the license agreement was amended to allow for us to secure enough active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") to ensure an adequate level of safety stock to prevent an interruption in the supply of Thiola and to prepare for a reformulation development project. In March 2016, the license agreement was amended to, among other things, include a new formulation development project for tiopronin tablets. In November 2017, the license agreement was amended to extend the license term, at a minimum, through May 2029. In November 2018, the license agreement was amended to extend the definition of territory beyond the United States and Canada.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and certain other jurisdictions for sparsentan and fosmetpantotenate, where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology that may be important to the development of our business.
Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes.
Fosmetpantotenate
Our patent portfolio covering compounds for the treatment of PKAN is comprised of five Retrophin-owned patent families. The first of these patent families includes patents and patent applications directed to fosmetpantotenate and structural analogs thereof, pharmaceutical compositions containing fosmetpantotenate (RE-024) or analogs thereof, and methods of using fosmetpantotenate or analogs thereof in the treatment of PKAN. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family included three U.S. patents (U.S. Patent No. 8,673,883, issued March 18, 2014, which we refer to herein as the ‘883 patent, U.S. Patent No. 9,181,286, issued November 10, 2015, and U.S. Patent No. 9,629,862, issued April 25, 2017), and one pending U.S. patent application (Application Serial No. 16/204,692, filed November 29, 2018). In addition, as of December 31, 2018 this patent family included two granted European patents (European Patent Nos. EP2841438 and EP3112372, which we refer to herein as the European ‘438 patent and the European ‘372 patent, respectively), a granted Chinese patent, a granted Japanese patent, a granted Hong Kong patent, a granted 
11

Russian patent, and corresponding foreign patent applications pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Russia. We expect the U.S. and foreign patents in this patent family to expire in April 2033.
Our second PKAN patent family is directed to a chemical genus that encompasses structural analogs of fosmetpantotenate, but not fosmetpantotenate itself. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family was comprised of a granted U.S. patent (U.S. Patent No. 9,896,464, issued February 20, 2018), a pending U.S. patent application (Application Serial No. 15/863,683, filed January 5, 2018) and a granted European patent (European Patent No. EP3060570, issued September 19, 2018). We expect any U.S. and European patents granted from this patent family to expire in October 2034.
Our third PKAN patent family is directed to another chemical genus that encompasses structural analogs of fosmetpantotenate, but not fosmetpantotenate itself. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family was comprised of pending patent applications in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand.
Our fourth PKAN patent family also is directed to a chemical genus that encompasses structural analogs of fosmetpantotenate, but not fosmetpantotenate itself. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family was comprised of an international patent application filed in 2017.
Our fifth PKAN patent family is directed to a pharmaceutical formulation of fosmetpantotenate. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family was comprised of an international patent application filed in 2018.
It is possible, assuming that fosmetpantotenate achieves regulatory approval and depending upon the date of any such approval, that the term of the ‘883 patent may be extended under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign jurisdictions upon regulatory approval. Likewise, it is possible, assuming that fosmetpantotenate achieves regulatory approval in Europe and depending upon the date of any such approval, that the term of the European ‘438 patent or the term of the European ‘372 patent may be extended in various European countries under the provisions governing Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs). Should we commercialize fosmetpantotenate, we may be obligated to pay royalties of up to 5% of net sales of all such products.
Sparsentan
Our patent portfolio for sparsentan is comprised of three distinct patent families, two of which are exclusively licensed from Ligand. One of the licensed patent families is owned by BMS, which exclusively licensed it to Ligand (the “BMS patent family”), and the other is owned by Ligand (the “Ligand patent family”). The third and fourth patent families are owned by Retrophin (the "Retrophin patent family").
The BMS patent family is directed to sparsentan and structural analogs thereof, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing sparsentan or a structural analog thereof. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family included three U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,638,937, which we refer to herein as the ‘937 patent; 6,835,741; and 6,852,745), of which one (U.S. Patent No. 6,638,937) claims sparsentan and pharmaceutical compositions that contain sparsentan. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, this patent family included a granted European patent and a granted Chinese patent. With the exception of the ‘937 patent, which the U.S. Patent and Trade Office ("USPTO") has determined is entitled to 175 days of patent term adjustment, we expect all U.S. and foreign patents in this patent family to expire in July 2019. In view of the USPTO determination that the ‘937 patent is entitled to 175 days of patent term adjustment, we expect the ‘937 patent to expire in December 2019.
The Ligand patent family is directed to methods of using sparsentan in the treatment of various diseases, including glomerulosclerosis and IgAN. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family included two U.S. patents (U.S. Patent No. No. 9,662,312, which we refer to herein as the ‘312 patent, and U.S. Patent No. 9,993,461, which we refer to herein as the ‘461 patent), a pending U.S. application (Application Serial No.  15/938,956, filed March 28, 2018), a European patent (European Patent No. EP2732818, which we refer to herein as the European ‘818 patent), a pending European application, and a granted Hong Kong patent. The ‘312 patent and the European ‘818 patent claim the use of sparsentan for treating glomerulosclerosis. The ‘461 patent claims both the use of sparsentan for treating glomerulosclerosis and the use of sparsentan for treating IgAN. We expect the U.S. and foreign patents in this patent family to expire in March 2030.
The first Retrophin patent family consists of an international patent application (i.e., a PCT application) filed in 2017, and our second Retrophin patent family consists of a provisional patent application filed in 2018.
It is possible, assuming that sparsentan achieves regulatory approval and depending upon the date of any such approval, that the term of either the ‘312 patent or the ‘461 patent may be extended under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign jurisdictions upon regulatory approval. Likewise, it is possible, assuming that sparsentan achieves regulatory approval in Europe and depending upon the date of any such approval, that the term of the European ‘818 patent may be extended in various European countries under the provisions governing Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs).
Thiola
Our patent portfolio for Thiola is comprised of a patent family which is exclusively licensed from Mission Pharmacal (the “Mission patent family”). The Mission patent family is directed to a new formulation of Thiola. As of December 31, 2018, this patent family included a U.S. patent application filed in 2018.

Regulatory Exclusivity
If we obtain marketing approval for sparsentan, fosmetpantotenate, CNSA-001 or other drug candidates in the United States or in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, we may be eligible for regulatory exclusivity for the approved drug. For example, in the United States, an FDA approved drug product may be eligible to receive five years of new chemical entity exclusivity or, for drugs granted an orphan designation by the FDA, seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. In Europe a new drug product approved by the EMA may receive eight years of data exclusivity and up to 11 years of marketing exclusivity or, in the case of orphan drugs, ten years of data exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any such regulatory exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. See “Government Regulation” below.
Chenodal
Chenodal received orphan drug designation in the United States for the treatment of CTX in 2010. Consequently, if Chenodal is the first chenodeoxycholic acid product to gain FDA approval for the treatment of CTX, we expect it will have 7 years of marketing exclusivity in the United States for that indication. Currently Chenodal does not have regulatory exclusivity in the United States.
Cholbam (Kolbam)
Cholbam received orphan drug designation in the United States for the treatment for pediatric and adult patients with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects and for patients with peroxisomal disorders, and therefore is expected to have marketing exclusivity in the U.S. for these indications until March 2022. 
Kolbam, the branded name of Cholbam in Europe, received marketing authorization in November 2015 from the EMA for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, encompassing select single enzyme defects. We expect Kolbam to have marketing exclusivity in Europe for these indications until September 2024.
Thiola
Thiola does not have regulatory exclusivity in the United States.
Trademarks
Our trademark portfolio includes both Retrophin-owned and Retrophin-licensed trademarks and is comprised of various U.S. and foreign registered trademarks and pending trademark applications relating to our company name, our commercial products (Thiola, Chenodal and Cholbam/Kolbam), and two of our product candidates (i.e. sparsentan and L-UDCA).
More specifically, as of December 31, 2018, our trademark portfolio included registered U.S. and foreign trademarks for the mark “RETROPHIN”, a registered U.S. trademark for the Retrophin logo, one registered U.S. trademark and one registered Canadian trademark for the mark “CHENODAL”, one registered U.S. trademark directed to the Chenodal logo, one registered U.S. trademark for the mark “MANCHESTER PHARMACEUTICALS”, one U.S. trademark application for the mark “KEEP IT BELOW THE LINE”, registered U.S. and foreign trademarks for the mark “CHOLBAM”, a registered European Community trademark for the mark “KOLBAM”, a registered U.S. trademark for the mark “TOTAL CARE HUB”, a registered U.S. trademark for the Total Care Hub logo, a registered U.S. trademark for a leaves logo, U.S. trademark applications and foreign registered trademarks related to sparsentan, and U.S. trademark applications relating to L-UDCA. In addition, under our license agreement with Mission we have an exclusive license to use Mission’s trademarks related to Thiola, including three registered U.S. trademarks and one registered Canadian trademark for the mark “THIOLA”, and several U.S. trademark applications.
Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary data and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. Consequently, we anticipate that trade secrets and know-how will, over time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from academic to industry scientific positions.
Manufacturing 
Nexgen Pharma manufactures Chenodal, New Zealand Pharma manufactures the active pharmaceutical ingredient for Cholbam, Patheon Inc. formulates and packages Cholbam, and Mission manufactures Thiola. 
We intend to continue to use our financial resources to accelerate development of our drug candidates rather than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to meet our pre-clinical and clinical trial manufacturing requirements by establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us. 
Should any of our drug candidates obtain marketing approval, we anticipate establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers in connection with the commercial production of our products. We have some flexibility in securing other manufacturers to produce 
13

our drug candidates; however, our alternatives may be limited due to proprietary technologies or methods used in the manufacture of some of our drug candidates.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
During fiscal 2018, we continued to utilize our specialty sales force to market our products. In order to commercialize our clinical drug candidates if and when they are approved for sale in the United States or elsewhere, we will need to increase our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities.
Commercialization
Through deep understanding of patient and healthcare provider needs, we believe we are able to: 

• | serve patients living with rare disease that have limited treatment options;


• | drive optimum performance of our marketed products;


• | educate and train healthcare providers about our products and the diseases for which they are approved to treat;


• | support access to and reimbursement coverage for our products in the U.S. without significant restrictions; and


• | minimize the number of patients who discontinue treatment or have low compliance with our products by providing patients with support services and disease education, to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable laws, to help them maximize the benefits of treatment.

Our U.S. commercial initiatives are designed to support patients living with rare diseases and clinicians treating these patients. We believe that it is possible to commercialize our products in the U.S. with a relatively small specialty sales force. The primary call points for Thiola include urologists and nephrologists. The primary call points for Cholbam are gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and metabolic specialists. We do not promote Chenodal using our sales force. 
Our sales force is differentiated by its high level of experience, averaging more than 15 years in pharmaceutical sales including over five years of experience in rare disease. Our commercial management and operations team has an average of more than 15 years of pharmaceutical experience focused on specialty and rare disease. 
Our small marketing team, supported by third-party agencies with rare disease experience, drives our commercialization and disease awareness efforts in the U.S. and countries where our products may be approved or available through named patient sales. Specifically, we implement a variety of marketing programs to educate physicians, including direct-to-physician contact by sales representatives, peer-to-peer educational programs, and participation in targeted medical convention programs. 
We distribute our products through one direct to patient pharmacy, Eversana (formerly Dohmen Life Science Services), who also provides our comprehensive patient support services (i.e., the Total Care Hub). This patient support program (for all U.S. commercial products) includes a case-managed approach to patient education, insurance verification and reimbursement support, co-pay and other financial assistance for eligible patients, monitoring and support of adherence, and 24/7 access to pharmacist counseling. 
Outside the U.S., including in the EU, we plan to continue to partner with local distributors and certain field-based personnel as necessary to conduct permitted commercial activities. Our near-term efforts are focused on securing pricing and reimbursement approval for Kolbam.
Medical Affairs
We have a medical affairs team in the U.S. which supports independent medical education programs and investigator-initiated studies by providing education and financial grants in a number of medical and disease-related areas. The responsibilities of medical affairs personnel also include providing education through the dissemination of medical information and publications, providing support in connection with our post-approval clinical commitments, and assisting in organizing scientific and medical advisory boards to obtain input from experts and practitioners on medical topics relevant to our products and diseases.
Government Regulation
Regulation by government authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. All of our products will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. Various federal and state statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage and record-keeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Drug Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical 
14

products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
We cannot market a drug product candidate in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:

• | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCP") requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMPs"); and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.

Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval at each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.  A sponsor may choose to pursue a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with FDA for the design of a Phase 3 trial. A SPA agreement is intended to provide assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocols are followed and the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of an NDA. An SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, if other new scientific concerns regarding product candidate safety or efficacy arise or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocols.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a 
15

compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program user fee. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10 months of filing; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within eight months of filing. Priority review can be applied to drugs to treat serious conditions that the FDA determines offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies ("REMS") to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA confers orphan drug status, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan indication are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation in and of itself does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular indication with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Prior to FDA approval, orphan designation provides incentives for sponsors including tax credits for clinical research expenses, the opportunity to obtain government grant funding to support clinical research, and an exemption from FDA user fees.
Fast Track Designation
Fast track is a process designed by the FDA to facilitate the development of drugs to treat serious conditions through expediting their review. The purpose is to get important new drugs to patients earlier. Fast Track addresses a broad range of serious conditions. Determining whether a condition is serious is a matter of judgment, but generally is based on whether the drug will have an impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the condition, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one.
A drug that receives Fast Track designation is eligible for some or all of the following:

• | more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the drug's development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval;


• | more frequent written communication from FDA about such things as the design of the proposed clinical trials and use of biomarkers;


• | eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review, if relevant criteria are met; and

16


• | rolling Review, which means that a drug company can submit completed sections of its Biologic License Application (BLA) or NDA for review by FDA, rather than waiting until every section is completed before the entire application can be reviewed. BLA or NDA review usually does not begin until the drug company has submitted the entire application to the FDA.

Once a drug receives Fast Track designation, early and frequent communication between the FDA and a drug company is encouraged throughout the entire drug development and review process. The frequency of communication assures that questions and issues are resolved quickly, often leading to earlier drug approval and access by patients.
Accelerated Approval
Under the FDA’s Subpart H accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA. 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments: Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;

17


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Pricing and Reimbursement
A portion of our end-user demand for our drugs comes from patients covered under Medicaid, Medicare and other federal and state government-related programs such as TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the VA. As required by Federal regulations, we will provide rebates and discounts in connection with these programs. 
Our commercial success depends in significant part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products will be available from third-party payers, including government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payer covers a particular product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to product acceptance.
Government authorities and other third-party payers are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third party payers also are carefully evaluating the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, which may require us to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
In addition, it is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted which could potentially impact the coverage and reimbursement rates for our products and also could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market.
There have been a number of enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industry that could affect our commercial success. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, (collectively, the “PPACA”) a law intended to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. Specifically, by way of example, the PPACA revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. PPACA also increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“ Tax Act”), includes a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1,2019, to increase the discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D from 50 percent to 70 percent, and close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain PPACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. The Texas U.S. District 
18

Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal or repeal and replace other elements of the PPACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers.
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes additional obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. 
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and numerous proposed and enacted legislation at both the state and federal levels designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, expedite generic competition, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, institute drug re-importation, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, HHS through CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, will affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. While some of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that the PPACA, as well as other federal and state healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any of our products, and could seriously harm our future revenues. In addition, it is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted which could potentially impact the reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and also could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market.
Health Care Regulatory Laws
In addition to FDA marketing restrictions and regulation of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict and regulate certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback statutes and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce; or in return for; purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that may induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal anti-kickback statute has been violated. Additionally, the 
19

PPACA amended the federal anti-kickback statute to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. The False Claims Act contains qui tam provisions, which allow a private individual, or relator, to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. For example, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate federal false claims laws.
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state controlled, in a manner that is different than in the United States. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in criminal or civil penalties or remedial measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity’s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains or transmits protected health information for or on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. We implemented compliance with the Sunshine Act starting with reporting year 2014 and continue to report as required.
Further, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and marketing codes, compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, and compliance with the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government.  Other various state level requirements include restricting payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; restricting various marketing practices; requiring prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products;  requiring the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes; requiring the registration of sales representatives; requiring the reporting of certain information related to drug pricing; and requiring drug manufacturers to track and report information related to payments, gifts, compensation, and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers. Additionally, states that have not implemented these types of regulations are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, administrative penalties, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, reputational harm, administrative burdens, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegation of non-compliance with these laws, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials and approval of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

Other Laws and Regulatory Processes
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the United States, including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and Nasdaq rules under which our stock is listed. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC, and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our accounts, our financial statements and other public disclosures are constantly considering and interpreting proposals and existing pronouncements designed to ensure that companies best display relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had 214 full-time employees.
