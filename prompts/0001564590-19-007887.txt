ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 We are a clinical biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class pharmacological therapies to restore and preserve vision for people with serious eye diseases. Our current product candidates focus on diseases affecting three major components of the eye: the retina, which is the tissue that lines the inside of the eye and is primarily responsible for vision; the choroid, which is the layer adjacent to the retina that supplies the retina with blood, oxygen and nourishment; and the sclera, which is the outer protective layer of the eye.
 Our suprachoroidal injection platform is a novel, patented approach for delivering pharmacotherapy to the back of the eye in the anatomic structure known as the suprachoroidal space, or SCS. The elasticity of the SCS allows for migration when fluid is injected between the choroid and sclera and allows the fluid to spread spherically toward the posterior regions of the eye where it is absorbed into adjacent tissue. We are able to precisely administer drugs into the SCS with our proprietary microinjector that utilizes a needle that is approximately one millimeter in length. This method of administration is different from intravitreal injections, the current standard for delivery of drugs for eye diseases, in that it facilitates more targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to chorioretinal structures.
 Our suprachoroidal injection technology is used in conjunction with our proprietary formulation of existing drug and novel therapies to create a therapeutic platform of product candidates to treat several serious eye diseases. With suprachoroidal injections, our product candidates are more directly administered to the retina and choroid and limit exposure to non-target tissues as compared to other ocular drug administration techniques such as injections of drug into the vitreous, a jelly-like substance that occupies the central portion of the eye. Intravitreal injections rely on diffusion of drug outward from the vitreous to the retina and choroid. This diffusion can result in lower concentrations of drug in these targeted areas and the drug spreading to unintended parts of the eye, potentially causing significant side effects. We believe treatment of eye disease via suprachoroidal injection of product candidates may provide a number of benefits, including lower frequency of administration, faster onset of therapeutic effect and an improved safety profile. 
 We hold the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize pharmacological agents for treatment of eye diseases via suprachoroidal injection and believe that suprachoroidal injections have the potential to become the standard of care for the treatment of retinal and choroidal diseases.
 The current development status of our product candidates is summarized in the chart below:

XIPERE (triamcinolone acetonide suprachoroidal injectable suspension) for Suprachoroidal Injection
 Our lead product candidate, XIPERE, formerly known as CLS-TA, is a proprietary, preservative-free suspension of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide, or TA, formulated for administration via suprachoroidal injection. Corticosteroids are approved for the treatment of diabetic macular edema, or DME, and are the standard of care in uveitis. They are effective at treating the inflammatory aspect of ocular disease, but when delivered locally, either topically as drops, intravitreally or by periocular injection, they have been associated with significant side effects, such as cataract formation or exacerbation, and elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, which can lead to glaucoma. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, therapies have also been shown to be effective in reducing other types of macular edema, but require frequent administration, in most cases either monthly or every other month after an initial period of monthly treatments.
 XIPERE for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis
 
Uveitis is a set of ocular inflammatory conditions affecting approximately 350,000 patients in the United States and more than one million worldwide. Approximately one-third of uveitis patients develop uveitic macular edema, a build-up of fluid in the macula, the area of the retina responsible for sharp, straight-ahead vision. Macular edema is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in uveitis patients and can occur from uveitis affecting any anatomic location—anterior, intermediate, posterior or panuveitis. The uveitis market is expected to grow to nearly $550 million by 2024 in the United States, and over $1 billion globally. 
 We are developing XIPERE initially for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. Based in part on the positive results from our Phase 3 PEACHTREE clinical trial, in December 2018, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for XIPERE for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis. On February 19, 2019 we received notification from the FDA that it had accepted the XIPERE NDA for review and had determined that the application was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date has been assigned for October 19, 2019. If approved, XIPERE would be the first therapy indicated for patients suffering from macular edema associated with uveitis.  We intend to begin commercializing XIPERE in the United States, if approved, in the first quarter of 2020.  
 
PEACHTREE was the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a drug candidate for patients with uveitic macular edema in which improvement in best corrected visual acuity, or BCVA, was the primary efficacy endpoint. It was also the first pivotal trial in which patients were evaluated across all types of uveitis: anterior, posterior, intermediate, and panuveitis. The trial met its primary endpoint with 47% of patients who received XIPERE every 12 weeks gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA as measured using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study, or ETDRS, scale, from baseline at week 24, compared to 16% of patients who underwent a sham procedure. This improvement was statistically significant, with a p-value of less than 0.001. All key secondary and additional endpoints of the PEACHTREE trial were also achieved. XIPERE was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the trial.
 

XIPERE for the treatment of diabetic macular edema
 
We are also studying XIPERE for the treatment of DME. DME is a sight-threatening disorder resulting from an accumulation of fluid in the macula caused by leakage from blood vessels damaged by poor glucose control as a consequence of diabetes mellitus. It is defined as retinal thickening of the macula. DME is the most common complication of diabetes in patients with diabetic retinopathy, causing images to appear blurry or wavy and colors to appear dull or washed out. We estimate that diabetic retinopathy affects approximately 8.3 million people in the United states, and that DME affects 1.1 million people in the United States.  
 
In May 2018, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as TYBEE, evaluating the safety and efficacy of administering XIPERE in combination with intravitreal EYLEA® (aflibercept), an anti-VEGF agent, in patients with DME. In TYBEE, patients in the control arm received only EYLEA. Patients in each arm of this trial achieved a statistically significant mean improvement in BCVA. The improvement in BCVA across arms was similar, with approximately one-half the number of treatment visits for patients in the combination arm. Based on consultation with our scientific and medical advisors, as well as review of our Phase 2 TYBEE clinical trial data and earlier Phase 1/2 DME clinical trial data, we believe there is a path forward with XIPERE in DME. We intend to pursue the development of XIPERE as monotherapy in DME and other potential indications outside of uveitis.
 XIPERE for the treatment of macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion
 
We were previously developing XIPERE in combination with an anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion, or RVO. On November 5, 2018, we announced that the primary endpoint of our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating XIPERE together with intravitreal Eylea in patients with RVO, which we refer to as SAPPHIRE, was not achieved, as approximately 50% of patients in both the combination arm and the control arm experienced a BCVA improvement of at least 15 
 4


letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment. In light of the 8-week topline data, we discontinued SAPPHIRE and TOPAZ, the companion Phase 3 trial to the SAPPHIRE trial assessing the efficacy and safety of suprachoroidal XIPERE together with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent (either Lucentis, ranibizumab, or Avastin, bevacizumab) in patients with RVO, as well as the clinical development of XIPERE in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of RVO.
Future potential product candidates 
 We believe that our SCS-focused approach has the potential to become more broadly used for the treatment of other back of the eye diseases, and we intend to develop additional product candidates for suprachoroidal injection based on the results of our current and planned clinical trials. In addition to uveitis, there are a number of ophthalmic conditions affecting the retina and choroid with unmet medical need for which suprachoroidal injection of medication may be beneficial and for which we may seek marketing authorization.
 We, alone and in collaboration with others, have performed multiple nonclinical studies in development areas such as small molecules or gene therapy as novel treatments for DME and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also known as wet AMD, and other ocular diseases that may benefit from suprachoroidal administration of additional medication for treatment or assisting durability.
 Our Platform
 We believe administration of pharmacological agents via suprachoroidal injection using our SCS Microinjector may provide improved levels of those agents to the targeted retina and choroid. We believe that our differentiated approach of injecting ocular drugs into the SCS may result in fewer side effects and improved amounts of drug at the diseased retina and choroid, as compared to intravitreal administration, a faster onset of therapeutic effect, a similar efficacy profile with lower drug amounts required, and longer duration of therapeutic effect with less frequent required injections. We also believe our platform offers the potential for safer, targeted ocular gene therapy without the risks of surgery and subretinal administration. Suprachoroidal administration of gene therapy could ultimately enhance access to care because it does not require specialized gene therapy surgery treatment centers. The procedure for suprachoroidal injection is conducted in an in-office setting and is similar in terms of patient preparation and duration to the procedure for intravitreal injection, and we therefore expect our products, if they achieve regulatory approval, to be incorporated into uveitis and retina specialists’ standard medical practice. 
 We, alone and in collaboration with others, have performed multiple nonclinical studies, in development areas such as small molecules, biologics and gene therapy, as potential treatments for DME, wet AMD, and other ocular diseases that may benefit from suprachoroidal administration of medication. Our drug candidates, SCS Microinjector and method of drug administration into the SCS are protected by 16 issued U.S. patents broadly directed to methods of administering drugs into the SCS by injection, including one design patent. In addition, our patent estate includes 14 patent applications pending in the United States, 29 issued foreign patents and 4 allowed foreign patents, 4 pending international PCT applications and 33 patent applications pending in major international markets, including the European Union, Canada, India, Japan, China and Australia, relating to our SCS delivery technology, as well as the formulations of our current therapeutic drug candidates and delivery device. Our issued patents are not scheduled to expire until between 2027 and 2035. Our patent applications relate to suprachoroidal injection technology and methods, our current therapeutic drug candidates and formulations, various therapeutic uses, including treatment of specific indications such as macular edema associated with uveitis and RVO, as well as DME and wet AMD, and administration of classes of drugs to the SCS, including anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-VEGF drugs. Our pending patent applications are not projected to expire until between 2027 and 2037. 
 XIPERE for macular edema associated with uveitis 
 Our lead product candidate, XIPERE, is a proprietary, preservative-free formulation of TA, specifically designed to be administered suprachoroidally using our SCS Microinjector for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the choroid and surrounding tissues. 
 We estimate that non-infectious uveitis affects over 350,000 patients in the United States, approximately one third of whom develop macular edema caused by inflammation. One of the hallmarks of uveitis is the accumulation of white blood cells in the different compartments of the eye such as the anterior segment, which is the area in front of the iris, the intermediate, which is the area directly behind the iris, the posterior, which is the area in and around the retina or choroid, or the pan, which is the accumulation of white blood cells in all of these compartments. Corticosteroids, such as TA, and other immunosuppressive agents that are administered either systemically or locally are the most common treatment for retinal diseases, including uveitic macular edema. However, many of these treatments result in only transient improvement and cause unwanted local or systemic side effects, such as cataracts and increased IOP which leads to glaucoma. In preclinical research, suprachoroidal injection of an investigational formulation of TA resulted in exposure of high levels of the corticosteroid to the retina, retinal pigmented epithelium, and choroid. This type of selective 
 5


chorioretinal targeting may provide rapid, sustained, and robust efficacy outcomes as a result of more specific and concentrated exposure of medication to relevant tissues. Suprachoroidal injection also limited corticosteroid exposure to the anterior chamber, iris-ciliary body, and lens, offering the potential to decrease the risk of cataracts, IOP elevation, and exacerbation of glaucoma. We believe that XIPERE will be at least as effective as commonly used formulations of TA in treating complications of uveitis, including the associated macular edema. If approved, XIPERE would be the first drug specifically indicated for macular edema associated with uveitis. 
 We believe that XIPERE will be at least as effective in treating uveitic macular edema as commonly used local treatments with corticosteroids. We believe that our suprachoroidal based local treatment may provide improved bioavailability of drug at the diseased retina and choroid, which may result in faster onset of therapeutic effect, a similar efficacy profile with lower drug amounts required, and longer duration of therapeutic effect, potentially resulting in a reduced frequency of necessary injections. We also believe that XIPERE may result in fewer side effects compared to commonly used corticosteroid treatments. 
 Pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial
 
We have completed PEACHTREE, a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of XIPERE administered through the SCS in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Based on feedback from our end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA held in May 2015, we believe that this trial will be the only pivotal clinical trial necessary to support approval of our NDA for this indication.
 
Clinical trial design
 PEACHTREE was conducted at 63
 investigational sites and enrolled 160 patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis, randomized either to a treatment arm consisting of 96 patients who received a 4.0 mg dose of XIPERE or to a sham injection procedure arm consisting of 64 patients. We used a sham injection procedure as a comparator for XIPERE, as opposed to an active drug, because there are no approved therapies for macular edema associated with uveitis against which to compare XIPERE, and there are no controlled, randomized trials with data in patients who can be used as an appropriate comparator arm. In order to simulate an injection to maintain masking, the sham injection procedure included all steps involved in the suprachoroidal injection procedure, except that a syringe with a needleless hub was used to apply pressure to the eye. Patients in each arm received their designated procedure at the beginning of the trial and a second procedure of the same type at week 12. All patients were followed and evaluated for a period of six months following the initial procedure. 
 Endpoints. The primary efficacy outcome of the trial was the percentage of patients who experienced an improvement of at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline at week 24. An improvement of 15 letters is considered clinically meaningful as it represents a doubling of the visual angle, indicating that patients were able to read letters half the size following study therapy compared to their vision at study entry. Secondary efficacy outcomes included additional measures of changes in BCVA and reductions in retinal thickness from baseline. Safety measures were monitored over the 24-week observation period and included the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events, including cataracts and increases in IOP. 
 Efficacy results.  In PEACHTREE, 45 of the 96 patients, or 47%, who received XIPERE at baseline and at 12 weeks gained at least 15 ETDRS letters in BCVA from baseline at week 24, compared to 10 of the 64 patients, or 16%, who underwent sham procedures at baseline and at week 12. This improvement, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, was statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001. These results are summarized in the figure below. 

6




Further, in terms of improvements in BCVA, the mean change from baseline was better in the active arm than the sham arm at each monthly evaluation. The mean improvement from baseline was also maintained throughout the evaluation period, with 9.6 letters gained at week 4 and 13.8 letters at week 24 in the active arm, compared to 1.3 letters at week 4 and 3.0 letters at week 24 in the sham arm. The mean improvements in BCVA were statistically significant at each 4-week evaluation point, each with a p-value of less than 0.001. The mean improvement from baseline at each 4-week evaluation point is shown in the figure below.

Improved vision could improve a patient’s quality of life and independence and potentially reduce burdens on the patient’s caregiver. In PEACHTREE, 2% of patients entered the study with vision of at least 20/40, or the ability to read 70 or more ETDRS letters. By week 24 in the treatment arm, 52% of patients could read 70 or more ETDRS letters, the minimum legal requirement to qualify for a driver’s license in most states, compared to 22% of patients in the control arm. 

In addition to these functional improvements in vision, there were anatomic improvements in macular edema, as demonstrated by other key secondary endpoints. Specifically, administration of XIPERE resulted in a mean reduction from baseline of 152.6 microns in central subfield thickness at week 24 in the active arm compared to a 17.9 micron mean reduction in the sham control arm, a result that was also statistically significant with a p-value of less than 0.001. These results are summarized in the figure below.

Signs of Inflammation Results.  Commonly evaluated signs of inflammation using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature, or SUN, scales resolved in more than two-thirds of the patients treated with XIPERE across three measures of inflammation of the eye. For example, 68% of patients in the treatment arm with any level of vitreous haze at baseline had vitreous haze scores of zero by the final visit at week 24, compared to 23% of patients in the control arm. Resolution of anterior chamber cells and anterior chamber flare was 72% and 74%, respectively, for patients in the treatment arm compared to 17% and 20%, respectively, for patients in the control arm. For patients with baseline scores of 2+ vitreous haze based on the SUN scale, 41% of patients experienced resolution in the treatment arm compared to 0% of patients in the control arm at week 24. Resolution on the SUN scales is defined as achieving a score of zero on the applicable SUN scale, implying no measurable inflammation was present. These results are summarized in the figure below.
Duration Results.  With respect to the durability of treatment effect, approximately 85% of the patients in the treatment arm did not receive rescue therapy, remaining on XIPERE treatment over the 24 weeks of the trial, compared to approximately 28% of patients in the control arm.

Safety results. XIPERE was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the trial. Through 24 weeks, corticosteroid-related elevated IOP adverse events were reported for approximately 11.5% of patients in the treatment arm, compared to 15.6% of patients in the control arm, when including patients who received corticosteroid rescue medication. Specifically, 72% of patients in the control arm were administered rescue medication, with 38 of the 46 receiving various forms of local corticosteroid treatments, such as intravitreal OZURDEX and periocular and intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. Of those 38 control arm patients receiving local corticosteroid rescue medication, 10 patients, or 26.3%, experienced elevated IOP adverse events. In the PeriOcular and INTravitreal Corticosteroids for Uveitic Macular Edema Trial (POINT) Study, a recent National Eye Institute clinical trial studying the effect of current commercial treatments on macular edema associated with uveitis, over 30% of uveitis patients who received intravitreal steroid injections experienced steroid-related elevated IOP adverse events and received treatments to lower IOP. The reduced number of IOP adverse events in the XIPERE-treated patients in PEACHTREE suggest an IOP-sparing benefit, possibly due to the unique compartmentalization and ocular distribution of the drug inherent to administration via suprachoroidal injection. Preclinical studies investigating suprachoroidal administration support this assertion, with low corticosteroid exposure observed within the anterior chamber and trabecular meshwork.
 
In PEACHTREE, adverse events involving changes in cataract grading from baseline were similar in each arm, with approximately 7.3% and 6.3% of patients in the treatment arm and control arm showing adverse event changes in cataract grading, respectively. Further, no cataract surgeries resulted from this trial. Three serious adverse events occurred in the trial, all of which were identified in the CLS-TA arm: sialadenitis, posttraumatic compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebral body, and a retinal detachment approximately 8 weeks after the injection procedure. None of these serious adverse events were deemed treatment related by the study investigator or led to study discontinuation.
 Additional trials 
 MAGNOLIA, an extension trial of PEACHTREE, followed 28 of the 96 patients who were in the treatment arm of PEACHTREE across 22 clinical sites for six additional months without protocol-directed treatment to better understand XIPERE’s long-term clinical profile. In MAGNOLIA, 50% of XIPERE-treated subjects maintained a mean improvement of 12.1 letters in BCVA from baseline through 36 additional weeks after their second suprachoroidal injection of XIPERE without requiring additional treatment.

In AZALEA, a Phase 3 safety trial, an additional 38 patients with non-infectious uveitis were enrolled in order to collect additional safety information required for our NDA submission. These patients were administered XIPERE at baseline and at week 12 and evaluated every 4 weeks after initial treatment, with a final evaluation at week 24. XIPERE was generally well tolerated, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported in the trial.
 Regulatory approval pathway 
 On February 19, 2019, we received notification from the FDA that the FDA had accepted the XIPERE NDA for review and had determined that the application was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The PDUFA goal date has been assigned for October 19, 2019. As part of our NDA submission under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, we relied on the results from all of our clinical trials as well as the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for TA and an analysis of available data from clinical literature. 
 We are also evaluating a number of options for potential submissions to regulatory agencies in additional territories outside of the United States for XIPERE for the treatment of patients with macular edema associated with uveitis. We intend to base any marketing applications in jurisdictions outside the United States, in part, on data obtained through these trials. 
 XIPERE for macular edema associated with retinal vascular diseases 
 DME
 We are also developing XIPERE for the treatment of DME. We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as TYBEE, evaluating the safety and efficacy of administering intravitreal Eylea, an anti-VEGF agent, and XIPERE to patients with DME, as compared to intravitreal Eylea alone. A total of 71 patients were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to receive either quarterly treatments of suprachoroidal XIPERE together with intravitreal Eylea at months 0 and 3 in the combination arm or four monthly treatments of intravitreal Eylea plus a sham suprachoroidal procedure at months 0, 1, 2 and 3 in the control arm, with patients in both arms receiving intravitreal Eylea treatment at months 4 and 5 as needed. Patient follow-up in TYBEE was six months after initial treatment.  Patients in each arm of this trial achieved a statistically significant mean improvement in BCVA as measured by the ETDRS letter scale from baseline over six months. When comparing the two arms, the difference in improvement in BCVA was not statistically significant. In TYBEE, patients who received both XIPERE and Eylea were able to achieve similar vision gains as the Eylea alone treatment arm with approximately half of the required treatments.
 In addition, patients in the combination arm and the control arm showed reduction in central subfield thickness, or CST, from baseline that was statistically significant. Specifically, 93% of patients in the combination arm had a greater than 50% reduction in excess CST at six months, compared to 73% of patients in the control arm.
 Suprachoroidal XIPERE in combination with intravitreal Eylea was generally well tolerated in the TYBEE trial, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported through the 24-week evaluation period. Elevated IOP adverse events were reported for 8.3% of patients in the combination arm, compared to 2.9% of patients in the control arm. Both the combination and control arms reported cataract adverse events, with approximately 5.6% of patients in the combination arm and 2.9% of patients in the control arm developing cataracts. 
 We also studied 20 patients with DME in an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial, which we refer to as HULK, to obtain safety data and to observe efficacy outcomes from administering a combination of intravitreal Eylea and XIPERE, as well as XIPERE alone, over a six-month evaluation period. In the trial, we observed a visual benefit for patients receiving XIPERE, with a greater benefit in treatment naïve eyes. Anatomic improvement was observed in all treated eyes, with more than two-thirds of those eyes achieving a greater than 50% reduction in excess central retinal thickness based on monthly measurements through six months after initial treatment. In the treatment naïve group, 40% of patients did not require retreatment over the entire six months, with an additional 20% requiring only one retreatment. XIPERE, including in patients who received as many as five injections, was well tolerated, with a low incidence of ocular side effects, including IOP elevations.
 We have consulted with our scientific and medical advisors to evaluate a path forward in our DME program. We believe there is a path forward with XIPERE in DME and intend to pursue the development of XIPERE as monotherapy in DME and other potential indications outside of uveitis.
 RVO
 
We were developing XIPERE in combination with an anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of macular edema associated with RVO, a sight-threatening disorder resulting from the blockage of a retinal vein. 
 
11


We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial, known as TANZANITE, in 46 patients with macular edema associated with RVO. In this trial, 23 patients in the active arm initially received XIPERE together with an intravitreal injection of the anti-VEGF agent Eylea, or intravitreal Eylea, and 23 patients in the control arm initially received only intravitreal Eylea. The objective of the trial was to determine whether patients receiving XIPERE together with intravitreal Eylea could sustain improvements in visual acuity and reductions in macular edema over the three month clinical trial while requiring fewer additional Eylea treatments than patients receiving intravitreal Eylea alone.  The primary endpoint of the trial was met, with patients in the active arm requiring an aggregate of 60% fewer additional Eylea treatments than patients in the control arm over three months, a result that was statistically significant (p=0.013).  In addition, patients in the active arm experienced greater improvement in visual acuity than those in the control arm, with patients in the active arm experiencing mean BCVA improvements at months one, two and three of 16, 20 and 19 letters, respectively, compared to improvements of 11, 12 and 11 letters, respectively, in the control arm at the same time points. 
 
 Based on the results of TANZANITE and after incorporating feedback from an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA held in late 2016, we enrolled patients in a 460 patient, multicenter, randomized, masked, controlled trial, to assess the efficacy and safety of XIPERE together with intravitreal Eylea in patients with RVO, which we refer to as SAPPHIRE. The primary endpoint of this trial was to determine the proportion of patients in each arm with a BCVA improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment. On November 5, 2018, we announced that the primary endpoint of SAPPHIRE was not achieved, as approximately 50% of patients in both the combination arm and the control arm experienced a BCVA improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment. In light of the 8-week topline data, we discontinued SAPPHIRE and TOPAZ, the companion Phase 3 trial to the SAPPHIRE trial assessing the efficacy and safety of suprachoroidal XIPERE together with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent (either Lucentis or Avastin) in patients with RVO, as well as the clinical development of XIPERE in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of RVO. 
 
Future potential product candidates 
 We believe that our SCS-focused approach has the potential to become more broadly used for the treatment of other back of the eye diseases, and we intend to develop additional product candidates for suprachoroidal injection based on the results of our current and planned clinical trials. We will then seek to secure appropriate regulatory authorizations to begin additional clinical testing for any such product candidates. In addition to uveitis, there are a number of ophthalmic conditions affecting the retina and choroid with unmet medical need for which suprachoroidal injection of medication may be beneficial and for which we may seek marketing authorization.
 We, alone and in collaboration with others, have performed multiple nonclinical studies in development areas such as small molecules or gene therapy as novel treatments for DME and wet AMD, and other ocular diseases that may benefit from suprachoroidal administration of additional medication for treatment or assisting durability.
 We believe administration of pharmacological agents via suprachoroidal injection may provide improved levels of those agents to the targeted retina and choroid, with the potential for enhanced efficacy. In addition, these medications may remain more localized to the areas of the eye that are diseased and away from other parts of the eye, with the potential for safety advantages. In preclinical studies investigating suprachoroidal administration of TA, low corticosteroid exposure was observed within the anterior chamber and trabecular meshwork. In addition, for medications that are water insoluble like TA, there may be durability benefits. Consequently, we believe that our differentiated approach of injecting ocular drugs into the SCS may result in improved amounts of drug at the diseased retina and choroid, as compared to intravitreal administration,
 a faster onset of therapeutic effect, a similar efficacy profile with lower drug amounts required, and longer duration of therapeutic effect with less frequent required injections.
 
Gene Therapy
 
During the past several years, gene therapy has demonstrated in preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by third parties that genetic material can be effectively and tolerably introduced to the retinal tissues, most often using an adeno associated virus, or AAV. Safe and reproducible delivery of gene therapy vector into the subretinal space is essential for successful targeting of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor rods or cones. Currently, the only approved retinal gene therapy and most investigational retinal gene therapies are delivered via retinal surgery at a limited number of specialized ocular gene therapy treatment centers. During the pars plana vitrectomy surgery, the surgeon creates a small hole in the retina to inject the gene therapy beneath the retina to the subretinal space without tearing or damaging the retina and macula. This process creates a small retinal detachment, which separates and exposes the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium to the gene therapy.  The retina is in a disease state and already compromised , and the procedure carries iatrogenic risk.  However, the success of this surgery is critical for the clinical efficacy of retinal gene therapy. Consequently, the surgery requires extensive training and the limited number of specialized ocular gene therapy centers creates patient access issues.

In preclinical studies we have conducted and through collaborations with both an academic center and gene therapy companies, we have observed that SCS injection can administer both viral and non-viral gene therapy. Using marker genes like green fluorescent protein and luciferase in both rabbits and non-human primates, we were able to use our SCS injection to achieve expression in the retina and choroid. We are dedicating some of our resources toward development of therapeutics using this approach. 
 In the February 2019 annual meeting of the Macula Society, researchers presented preliminary evidence of the potential for suprachoroidal administration of gene-based therapies. In a rabbit model, suprachoroidal administration of non-viral DNA nanoparticle gene therapy, or DNPs, marker gene luciferase activity was observed that was comparable to that seen from subretinal injections and significantly greater than that seen from untreated eyes. Suprachoroidally injected DNPs were well tolerated, showed luciferase activity in the choroid and retina of rabbit eyes and provided preliminary evidence of the potential for suprachoroidal administration of gene-based therapies. Specifically, suprachoroidal administration does not require detachment of the photoreceptors from the retinal pigment epithelium, and consequently, avoids the risk of iatrogenic subretinal injection to an already-compromised retina. Suprachoroidal injection procedure training is minimal and could ultimately enhance access to care because it would not have to be administered at a specialized gene therapy surgery treatment center. 
 
Consequently, we believe suprachoroidal administration may further enhance the value proposition of ocular gene therapy by potentially improving safety and expanding access. We are exploring both non-viral and viral gene therapies in preclinical studies both alone and in collaborations with an academic center and gene therapy companies. 
 The SCS Microinjector 
 Our drug candidates have been and will be specifically formulated to be injected with our SCS Microinjector via suprachoroidal injection in order to flow to the back of the eye. If our products are approved for marketing by applicable regulatory authorities, we will package the drug along with the SCS Microinjector syringe and two 30-gauge hollow microneedles of varying lengths, each less than 1.2 millimeters, within a custom-designed hub that optimizes insertion and suprachoroidal administration of drugs. 
 Our proprietary SCS Microinjector, shown below, can be used to inject a wide variety of drugs into the SCS. 
 


The suprachoroidal injection is designed to be carried out perpendicular to the sclera, at a site similar to an intravitreal injection, under local anesthesia. Once the microneedle penetrates the sclera and reaches the SCS, the boundary between the sclera and the choroid, the open bevel of the needle releases the drug between these two layers. Once drug is injected into the SCS, it spreads within the SCS to the back of the eye, where diseases manifest. The preparation and injection will require minimal training for the administering retinal specialist and can be accomplished in an in-office setting. 
 13


Current intravitreal injections are performed in a procedure similar to that of suprachoroidal injections, except that the hypodermic needles and syringes used in intravitreal injection procedures are designed so that the needle penetrates through all of the layers of the eye and drug is injected into the vitreous cavity, where the precise spatial location of the needle is not as important as when injecting into the SCS. Intravitreal injections are typically performed using a needle that is approximately five millimeters in length, or four times the length of our microneedle. Using a needle of this length, the physician penetrates past the sclera, choroid and retina until reaching the vitreous and does not receive any tactile feedback as to when the needle had reached one of the layers between the sclera and the vitreous. By contrast, our SCS Microinjector is designed to inject drug into the SCS. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own any manufacturing facilities. We utilize contract manufacturers to formulate and produce our drug candidates and to produce our SCS Microinjector used for our clinical trials. We procure the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our drugs from a third-party supplier. We expect to utilize third-party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our drugs and SCS Microinjector, if approved. 
 On May 8, 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with Gerresheimer Regensburg GmbH to supply our SCS Microinjector. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms, the Gerresheimer agreement has an initial term of five years, after which it renews in three-year increments unless either party gives notice of non-renewal at least one year in advance. Each party has the right to terminate the agreement for customary reasons such as material breach and bankruptcy. The Gerresheimer agreement contains provisions relating to compliance by Gerresheimer with current Good Manufacturing Practices, confidentiality and other customary matters for an agreement of this nature. We anticipate entering into commercial supply agreements with our other suppliers at a later date. 
 Commercialization 
 If approved by the FDA, we intend to commercialize our product candidates in the United States, and we may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions. Our management team has substantial experience in commercializing ophthalmic drugs at large and small companies including Genentech, Novartis, Alimera and Santen.
 There are approximately 1,900 uveitis and retina specialists in the United States. We believe we will be able to reach this concentrated set of specialists efficiently, with a small sales force combining expertise and demonstrated success, including retina and uveitis expertise, device training and understanding of the dynamics associated with launching buy-and-bill therapeutics.
 We intend to complement our sales force with a small field-based reimbursement support team, patient support services, and a small payor field team responsible for educating payors on the clinical data and value proposition supporting the on-label use of XIPERE and the SCS injection procedure.
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 
With respect to XIPERE, we face competition from other commercially available forms of TA and other injectable and implantable corticosteroids. Bristol-Myers Squibb markets TA under the brand name Kenalog. Kenalog is indicated only for intramuscular or intraarticular injection; however, it is used off-label for intraocular inflammation using intravitreal and periocular administration. There are also a number of generic equivalents of Kenalog. In addition, Alcon’s injectable TA, Triesence, is approved in the United States for the treatment of uveitis and other inflammatory conditions unresponsive to topical corticosteroids, although it is not indicated for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis or RVO or DME. OZURDEX, marketed by Allergan, is a bioerodable extended release implant that delivers the corticosteroid dexamethasone and is approved for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye and for macular edema due to RVO in both the United States and in the European Union, and received approval from the FDA to treat DME. 
 Additionally, there are several corticosteroid treatments intended for longer term steroid control once the patients have been ruled out for cataracts or susceptibility to elevated IOP. Bausch Health markets Retisert, an intravitreal implant of the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis. Eyepoint Pharmaceuticals recently received approval of Yutiq, an injectable form of fluocinolone acetonide for the treatment of chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye. 
 14


Iluvien, marketed by Alimera Sciences, has been approved in both the United States and the European Union for the treatment of DME. 
 Our product candidates could also compete with anti-VEGF drugs, which are the current standard of care for RVO, wet AMD and DME. Genentech’s products Lucentis and Avastin are both anti-VEGF antibodies. Lucentis is currently approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following RVO, DME and diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. Avastin is an anti-VEGF drug used off-label by uveitis and retina specialists in both the United States and in certain countries of the European Union for the treatment of numerous retinal diseases, but it is not indicated for ophthalmic use. In the United States, Regeneron’s anti-VEGF product, Eylea, is approved for the treatment of wet AMD, macular edema following RVO and DME and diabetic retinopathy. In the European Union, Eylea is approved for the treatment of wet AMD, DME and RVO. 
 Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient recruitment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs before we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or obtaining FDA market exclusivity, thereby delaying our product approvals. Competitors’ patent protection could also potentially delay FDA approval of our product candidates for up to 30 months, and we may still be subject to potential patent litigation that might arise beyond the 30 months. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Intellectual property 
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our technologies and methods of accessing the SCS, drug candidates and formulations as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for novel applications, uses, and technological innovations related to our drug candidates, proprietary delivery devices and core technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 Patents and patent applications 
 Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes 16 granted U.S. patents broadly directed to methods of administering drugs into the SCS by injection, including one design patent. In addition, our patent estate includes 14 patent applications pending in the United States, 29 issued foreign patents and four allowed foreign patents, four pending international PCT applications and 33 patent applications pending in major international markets, including the European Union, Canada, India, Japan, China and Australia, relating to our SCS delivery technology, as well as the formulations of our current therapeutic drug candidates and delivery device. Of these patents and patent applications, we license five of the 16 issued U.S. patents, four pending U.S. applications, 12of the issued foreign patents and one of the allowed foreign patents, and five foreign patent applications in major international markets, each relating to methods of delivering drugs to the eye by microneedle administration, pursuant to a license agreement with Georgia Tech Research Corporation and Emory University that is described below. With respect to the in-licensed international PCT applications, according to the terms of the license agreement, we advise Georgia Tech and Emory regarding the countries in which patent applications should be pursued. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, our issued in-licensed U.S. patents are expected to expire between 2027 and 2029, without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or extensions. Applications relating to SCS delivery technology and methods, our current therapeutic drug candidates and formulations, various therapeutic uses, including treatment of specific indications such as macular edema associated with uveitis and RVO, wet AMD as well as DME and improvement of specified clinical parameters, are expected to expire between 2027 and 2037, without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be extended by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and 
 15


granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. 
 Our product candidates are protected against genericization through numerous patents. In the case of XIPERE injected into the SCS, an applicant who files a paragraph 4 ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA certifying they may circumvent our patents must also demonstrate comparability of the proposed drug, which we believe may require a clinical trial in macular edema associated with uveitis, against our product, unless a biowaiver is obtained. 
 Third-party patent filings 
 Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products, including patents and applications related to surgical methods of accessing the SCS and certain formulations of TA. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. 
 Under U.S. law, a person may be able to patent a discovery of a new way to use a previously known compound, even if such compound itself is patented, provided the newly discovered use is novel and nonobvious. Such a method-of-use patent, however, if valid, only protects the use of a claimed compound for the specified methods claimed in the patent. This type of patent does not prevent persons from using the compound for any previously known use of the compound. Further, this type of patent does not prevent persons from making and marketing the compound for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. 
 License agreement with Emory and Georgia Tech 
 In July 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Emory University, or Emory, and the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, or GTRC, under which we received a worldwide exclusive license to specified patents relating to methods and devices for drug delivery using a microinjector. The field of the license covers all ophthalmic uses of the microinjector for mammals and birds. Under this license agreement, we have agreed to direct all prosecution of intellectual property to the licensors’ patent counsel and have agreed to pay for all intellectual property expenses associated with the licensed patents. 
 Under this license agreement, we made an initial $30,000 upfront payment and a $35,000 milestone payment upon dosing of the first human patient in a clinical trial. This license agreement requires us to make a $75,000 milestone payment upon the occurrence of a specified event relating to the commercialization of a drug developed using the licensed patents. On July 1, 2018, we paid Emory and GTRC $75,000 to extend the date by which we may achieve the commercialization milestone. We are obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $25,000, which will continue until the first commercial sale of a product covered by the licensed patents. Additionally, we will owe a low single-digit royalty on any worldwide net product sales related to the licensed patents, with minimum annual royalties starting at $15,000 per year after commercialization. The minimum annual royalty increases each year after the first commercial sale, up to a maximum amount of $100,000 per year in the sixth calendar year and in subsequent years. 
 We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of products related to the licensed patients. We are obligated to provide Emory and GTRC a written report detailing our activities related to the development and commercialization of products twice a year. 
 Royalties are calculated based on net sales of products covered by a patent licensed under the agreement, and are due on each such product sold as long as the patent covering that particular product is valid and unexpired. Unless otherwise terminated pursuant to its termination provisions, this license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents. We have the right to terminate this license agreement at any time upon 60 days’ written notice to Emory and GTRC. Emory and GTRC may also terminate this license agreement in the event of a material breach by us. This license agreement will immediately terminate if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents in a court or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction. 
 Trademarks, trade secrets and know-how 
 Our trademark portfolio currently consists of two registered trademarks in each of Australia, Korea, Russia and Singapore, four registered trademarks in Brazil and three pending applications in Brazil, two registered trademarks in Canada and three pending applications in Canada, five registered trademarks in China, four registered trademarks in the European Union, one registered trademark in each of India and New Zealand and one pending application in each of India and New Zealand, two registered trademarks in each of Israel and Japan, six registered trademarks in Mexico and one pending application in Mexico, five pending 
 16


applications in South Africa, four registered trademarks in the United States and three pending applications in the United States.  In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and employees. These and other agreements, such as invention assignment agreements, grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
 Government regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and device products under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. While it may be the case that when a drug and a device are used together, which is called a combination product, the FDA typically regulates the dispenser of a drug, such as a syringe co-packaged with a drug, as a drug itself. 
 In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. We have been advised that, within CDER, the division responsible for ophthalmology, which will have primary jurisdiction, views our product candidate as a drug. Based on our discussions with the FDA, including our pre-NDA meeting, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require changes to this approach, although the FDA could change its position during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit.
 Drugs 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include: 

• | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------


• | FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA, which might include an Advisory Committee review; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA or an IRB may nevertheless initiate a clinical hold after the 30 days if, for example, significant health risks arise. 
 In the United States, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the sites at which the trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. 
 17


Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap. These phases generally include the following: 
 Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics. 
 Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
 Phase 3. If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 
 Phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval. 
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition and quality of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, although waivers may be granted and exemptions apply in limited cases. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. 
 Review of application 
 Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review.   This is typically 10 months from the date of submission for drugs that are not new molecular entities, such as our product candidates. The review process can be expedited if priority review is granted.  In such a case, the FDA review period is only 6 months.  Alternatively, the FDA review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMPs and may also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. The device component of our products will also be subject to review as part of the NDA review process and its manufacturers subject to inspection for compliance with device cGMPs embodied in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a black box warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter, detailing the deficiencies and information required for reconsideration of the application. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for approved products, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications. 
 18


The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also require a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among other things, a medication guide, special training for prescribers and dispensers, and patient registries. 
 In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved devices or drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs, device cGMPs embodied in the QSR and combination product cGMPs that, for drug/device combination products, specify the requirements within the drug cGMPs and the QSR with which manufacturers must comply. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including without limitation the FDCA, the federal civil False Claims Act, other federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. 
 The Hatch-Waxman amendments 
 Our regulatory strategy is to pursue development of our drugs as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs under the FDCA. As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of drugs previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product. As such, under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. Therefore, if we can satisfy the conditions required for a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submission, it may eliminate the need for us to conduct some of the preclinical studies or clinical trials for the new product candidate that might otherwise have been required, although the review time is not shortened. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require us to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. 
 Orange Book listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the 
 19


drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the referenced drug, to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the date on which such patent expires or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The fourth certification described above is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. This section viii statement does not require notice to the patent holder or NDA owner. There might also be no relevant patent certification. 
 If the reference NDA holder and patent owners file patent litigation directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the case that is favorable to the applicant. Even if the 45 days expire, a patent infringement lawsuit can be brought and could delay market entry, but it would not extend the FDA-related 30-month stay of approval. 
 The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. 
 Non-patent exclusivity 
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug. 
 A drug, including one approved under a 505(b)(2) application, may obtain a three-year period of non-patent market exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the three-year exclusivity period. A 505(b)(2) NDA may also be subject to a five-year exclusivity period for a new chemical entity, whereby the FDA will not accept for filing, with limited exception, a product seeking to rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety or effectiveness for such new chemical entity. 
 Orphan drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan drugs are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing. In addition, an NDA for a product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as another drug’s showing of clinical superiority over the drug with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different active moieties for the same indication or obtain approval for the same active moiety for a different indication. In addition, doctors may prescribe products for off-label uses and undermine our exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same active moiety for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. 
 We do not plan to pursue orphan drug designation for XIPERE for the treatment of uveitis in the United States. However, we may seek designation for other products in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will obtain orphan drug designation for any products in any jurisdiction. Even if we are able to obtain orphan drug designation for a product, we cannot be sure that such product will be approved, that we will be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, if ever, or that we will be able to maintain any exclusivity that is granted.

Foreign regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Federal and state fraud and abuse, data privacy and security and transparency laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Therefore, even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend ourselves against enforcement or litigation due to the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in life sciences companies in the United States and some of the applicable laws are broad in scope.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the federal civil False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical, device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. 
 The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The federal criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal and civil statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare 
 21


benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. 
 Under HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by covered entities including certain health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH and their regulations, including the omnibus final rule published on January 25, 2013, also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.  Accordingly, state attorneys general (along with private plaintiffs) have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules.  New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. 
 In the EU/EEA, the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), or GDPR, went into effect on May 25, 2018 and replaced Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Privacy Directive).  The GDPR applies to identified or identifiable personal data processed by automated means (for example, a computer database of customers) and data contained in, or intended to be part of, non-automated filing systems (traditional paper files) as well as transfer of such data to a country outside of the EU/EEA.  Under the GDPR, fines of up to €20.0 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance.  The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data and creates additional rights for data subjects. Additionally, in June 2016, United Kingdom voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” which could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. In March 2017, the United Kingdom began the process to leave the EU by April 2019.  While the Data Protection Act of 2018, that “implements” and complements the GDPR has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the United Kingdom, it is still unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the United Kingdom will remain lawful under GDPR. We may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the United Kingdom privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.
 Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States.  Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households.  When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the CCPA will require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Legislators have stated that amendments will be proposed to the CCPA before it goes into effect, but it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. As currently written, the CCPA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
 Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and/or entities. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released its final rule implementing the Physician Payments Sunshine Act that imposes annual reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer and device manufacturer marketing practices, require registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, require drug manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drugs, or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to particular types of healthcare professionals and entities.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health care laws or regulations described above that are applicable to us, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 The physicians who use our product candidates, if approved, may be reimbursed by third-party payors for both the suprachoroidal injection using our SCS Microinjector and for the drug itself. On July 1, 2016, the American Medical Association, or AMA, approved a new Category III Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code for the suprachoroidal injection of pharmacologic agents. Category III codes are a set of temporary codes maintained by the AMA for emerging technology, services and procedures. Payment for these services or procedures are based on the coverage policies of individual third-party payors, including private insurers and government-funded programs, like Medicare, and Medicare administrative contractors. CPT code 0465T became effective on January 1, 2017, but we believe obtaining a separate CPT code for the use of our products is essential to our commercial success. We intend to seek a Category 1 CPT code and a separate Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, or HCPCS, code as maintained by CMS for the drug itself should we receive approval from the FDA. We believe that separate CPT and HCPCS codes will help third-party payors differentiate our drug candidates from other drugs currently on the market administered through intravitreal injections, although we can provide no assurance that CMS will approve the creation of a separate CPT code or HCPCS code. Additionally, there is no guarantee that these billing codes or the payment amounts, if any, associated with such codes will not change in the future. 
 Our strategy will include efforts to engage third-party payors to establish coverage, coding and reimbursement that will facilitate access to our product candidates and the SCS injection procedure as we expand our commercialization efforts in the United States. Our success in these efforts depends in part on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our product candidates are administered and for the drugs themselves. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for the procedures to administer our product candidates or for the product candidates themselves, or adverse changes in third-party payors’ policies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. 
 In the U.S., third-party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements. Failure to obtain favorable coverage policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
 In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, third-party payors from time to time update reimbursement amounts and also revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to ambulatory surgery centers, hospitals and physicians for the procedures performed administering our products, which could directly impact the demand for any of our product candidates that may be approved. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program updates to physician payments, which is done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. However, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula, and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025. MACRA also introduced a quality payment program under which individual providers with Medicare billings of $30,000 or 100 patient visits per year will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards. The quality payment program has two tracks, one known as the merit based incentive payment system for providers in the fee-for service Medicare program, and the advanced alternative payment model for providers in specific care models, such as accountable care organizations. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program will begin in 2019. At this time it is unclear how the introduction of the quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. Any changes in coverage and 
 23


reimbursement that further restricts coverage of our products or lowers reimbursement for procedures using our products could materially affect our business. 
 Healthcare reform 
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products, or for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or limit coverage of our products. The cost containment measures that third-party payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. 
 For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. 
 The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. In addition, the Affordable Care Act implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement

methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. On January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. While a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
