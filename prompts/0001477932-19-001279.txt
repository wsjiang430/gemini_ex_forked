Item 1. Business.
 
First Foods Group, Inc. (the "Company" or “First Foods”) is a smaller reporting company focused on developing its specialty chocolate line and participating in merchant cash advances through its 1st Foods Funding Division (the “Division”). First Foods continues to pursue new foodservice brands and menu concepts. 
 
On August 31, 2017, the Company formed Holy Cacao, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Holy Cacao”). Holy Cacao has 100 shares of no par value common stock authorized, issued and outstanding with 90 shares owned by the Company and 10 shares owned by non-controlling interests. Holy Cacao is dedicated to producing, packaging, distributing and selling specialty chocolate, as well as licensing its intellectual property (“IP”), including its name, brand, and packaging, to third parties. The Company has not been, is not, and has no current plans to be involved in producing, packaging, distributing or selling any product that is infused with a hemp-based or marijuana-based ingredient. The Company is in the business of licensing its IP to third parties that may produce, package, distribute or sell hemp-based or marijuana-based products, but only in those states where such activities are legal. The Company has not currently sold any product and has not currently earned any revenue from its Holy Cacao business. On February 27, 2019 the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) approved Holy Cacao’s trademark brand, “The Edibles’ Cult”. Holy Cacao has submitted multiple applications to the USPTO for additional brand names, including “Mystere” among others. The Company has executed two Holy Cacao agreements. On February 5, 2019, the Company signed a Consulting Agreement with a consultant to assist in the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of the Company’s chocolate product line. On March 26, 2019 the Company signed a Facility Access and Wholesale Production Purchase and Sale Agreement that allows it to use a fully staffed and fully equipped state of the art manufacturing facility to begin producing its specialty chocolate product and selling it to manufacturing and wholesaling companies. 
 
On October 25, 2017, the Company entered into a contract with TIER Merchant Advances LLC (“TIER”) to participate in the purchase of future receivables from qualified TIER merchants for the purpose of generating near-term and long-term revenue for the Company. The Company may also provide cash advances directly to merchants.
 
OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
We are primarily focused on developing our specialty chocolate line and related IP through our Holy Cacao subsidiary. We have developed twenty-three (23) proprietary recipes for our specialty chocolate product line that we have tested in a fully staffed and fully equipped state of the art manufacturing facility. We actively market our specialty chocolate product line on a full-time basis to our extensive network of manufacturers and wholesalers on an individual basis, as well as through multiple industry specific trade shows, through our on-line website presence, and through our ongoing collaboration with a diverse team of leading industry consultants who specialize in media relations, public relations, and investor relations. We have also obtained a trademark from the USPTO for “The Edibles’ Cult” brand and have submitted multiple applications to the USPTO for additional brand names, including “Mystere” among others. These efforts have culminated in two Holy Cacao agreements, including a Consulting Agreement with a consultant to assist in the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of the Company’s specialty chocolate product line and a Facility Access and Wholesale Production Purchase and Sale Agreement that allows us to begin commercial production of our specialty chocolate product line and allows our first commercial buyer to begin submitting purchase orders to us. 
 
We are secondarily involved in merchant cash advance participations. When a merchant cash advance is purchased, the Company records a merchant cash advance participation receivable for the purchase price. The purchase price consists of the merchant cash advance principal plus an up-front commission that is amortized over the term of the merchant cash advance. The amount of the commission is negotiated between the Company and TIER for each contract. The standard commission is 15% of the merchant cash advance principal but can be reduced depending upon the credit worthiness of the merchant. If a merchant cash advance contract is signed in one period, but not paid until a subsequent period, a corresponding liability is established in the current period.
 
At the time the merchant cash advance is purchased, the Company records a deferred revenue liability, which is the total future receivable due to the Company less the principal amount of the merchant cash advance. Revenue is recognized and the deferred liability is reduced over the term of the merchant cash advance.
 
TIER maintains a bank account on behalf of the Company. Each day, TIER receives payment, reflected in the bank account, for each merchant cash advance TIER has purchased on behalf of the Company from various merchant cash advance providers. The Company reduces its merchant cash advance balance by the cash received, which is net of platform fees. Platform fees are a daily charge associated with the ACH service and the financial and reporting management software platform provided by TIER. The platform fees are also negotiated between the Company and TIER for each contract but are typically 4% of the daily merchant cash advance principal amount.

TARGET MARKET AND OUR NICHE WITHIN
 
Our highest priority target market consists of chocolate manufacturers and wholesalers who have a desire to use our high-end, specialty chocolate as an important raw ingredient for their ultimate retail product. We continue to pursue target markets that, based upon the experience of our Board, offer high growth potential that we can realize by applying our niche franchising expertise.
 
Our secondary target market consists of merchant cash advance participations. We are aware of an increasing demand for lending services and products for small businesses, and we believe the merchant cash advance market is in a growth mode that presents us with significant opportunity. Furthermore, we believe the small business lending market is underserved and the ability of small businesses to obtain credit with traditional banking institutions is difficult. Our niche approach is to participate with other syndicated participants in a broad range of merchant cash advances, as well as selectively issue merchant cash advances directly to merchants we know well.
 
COMPETITION, OUR COMPETITIVE STRATEGY AND METHODS OF COMPETITION
 
Our competition consists of companies that operate in the specialty chocolate industry. Our competitive strategy is to target the consumers of specialty, high-end chocolate.
 
MARKETING, MARKETING OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES
 
The Company markets its specialty chocolate, as well as related IP and packaging, to existing and emerging food service companies, focusing specifically on brand development. 
 
Our Marketing Objectives are as follows:
 

· | Establishing and promoting our presence in our selected targeted market; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Building a network of food service industry professional relationships and referrals.

 
To promote and market our products, we have invoked the following strategies:
 

· | Enhanced our online presence via our Company website reflecting our scope of products offered.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Implemented a PR campaign to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business. 

 
Currently, the Company’s officers and directors promote our specialty chocolate, IP and packaging through many channels, including networking at local industry events and Internet sources. The Company does not actively market its merchant cash advance participation because all marketing activities are performed by the merchant cash advance providers, such as TIER. We anticipate that, as the Company grows over the next twelve months, pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the food service industry and by using technical and marketing consultants, which will allow qualified individuals to join our management team and Board of Directors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
The Company has engaged market and branding consultants to research and develop specialty chocolate products, IP and packaging targeted to particular states within the US. 
 
EMPLOYEES
 
The Company currently has one full time employee, Mark J. Keeley, who is a director and our Chief Financial Officer. Harold Kestenbaum is a director consultant serving in the role of interim Chief Executive Officer. Abraham Rosenblum is a director serving in the role of Secretary. These individuals, along with director Hershel Weiss, are responsible for operations, product development, sales and marketing, fund raising, implementation of our general strategy and execution of our business plan. Additionally, the Company retained a prospective employee to become a permanent employee when he obtains his United States visa and the Company may legally hire him. It is anticipated that this employee will work in the facility we have contracted and will assist with the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of the Company’s specialty chocolate product line.
 
Our future business and operating results depend significantly on the continued contributions and active participation of the aforementioned individuals. These individuals would be difficult or impossible to replace. The loss of these key contributors, or their failure to perform, could materially and adversely affect our Company's operations. While we may obtain Key Man insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the loss incurred in the event these individuals are lost.
 
Our officers and directors receive compensation for their services during the development stage of our business operations. Our officers and directors are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf. We anticipate adding a permanent Executive Chef over the next twelve (12) months. We do not currently have any benefits, such as health or life insurance, available to our employee or directors.
