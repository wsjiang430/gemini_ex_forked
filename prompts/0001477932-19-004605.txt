ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate History

We were incorporated under the name Imagine Media, Ltd. on August 10, 2007. From inception through early 2009, our business was to publish and distribute Image Magazine, a monthly entertainment guide for the Denver, Colorado area. We generated only limited revenue and essentially abandoned our business plan in January 2009.

On September 19, 2011, we, Imagine Media, Ltd., a Delaware corporation, acquired approximately 52% of the outstanding shares of TransBiotec, Inc., (“TBT”) from TBT’s directors in exchange for 12,416,462 shares of our common stock. The accounting for this transaction was identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except that no goodwill, or other intangibles were recorded, as the members of TransBioTec retained the majority of the outstanding common stock of Imagine Media LTD after the share exchange. These directors of TBT were Charles Bennington, Devadatt Mishal, Nicholas Limer, and Sam Satyanarayana. At the time, these shares represented approximately 52% of our outstanding common stock. TBT was a California corporation. In connection with this transaction, two of our officers resigned and Charles Bennington and Nicholas Limer were appointed as directors and as our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, and our Secretary, respectively, and Ronald Williams was appointed as our Chief Technology Officer.

On January 17, 2012, our Board of Directors amended our Certificate of Incorporation changing our name from Imagine Media, Ltd. to TransBiotec, Inc. On January 31, 2012, we acquired approximately 45% of the remaining outstanding shares of TBT in exchange for 10,973,678 shares of our common stock. In connection with this transaction, two of our directors resigned and Sam Satyanarayana, Ronald Williams and Devadatt Mishal were appointed directors. Because of the September 2011 and January 2012 acquisitions of TBT common stock, we currently own approximately 98% of the outstanding shares of TBT, and we control its Board of Directors and officer positions. The remaining approximately 2% is owned by non-affiliated individuals that did not participate in the share exchange.

Because of the acquisition, TBT’s business is our business and, unless otherwise indicated, any references to “us” or “we” include the business and operations of TBT. Due to our approximately 98% ownership of TBT, the approximately 2% non-controlling interest is combined with ours in the attached financial statements.

Our offices are located at 400 N. Tustin Ave., Suite 225, Santa Ana, CA, 92705, telephone number (714) 667-7139.

Business Overview

General

We have developed an alcohol detection device called “SOBR”. The device is a patented device for use in detecting alcohol in a person’s system by testing the ethanol content in their perspiration. Once SOBR is developed and tested, we plan to market the device to four primary business segments: (i) as an aftermarket-installed device to companies and institutions that employ or contract with vehicle drivers, such as trucking companies, limousine companies, and taxi cab companies, where the system will be marketed as a preventative drunk driving detection system, with a possible ignition locking device, (ii) the original equipment manufacturing (OEM) market, where the device would be installed in new vehicles during the original building of a vehicle, (iii) companies and institutions that have an interest in monitoring their employees’ or contractors’ alcohol level due to their job responsibilities, such as surgeons prior to entering surgery, pilots prior to flying aircraft, mineworkers prior to entering a mine, or the military for personnel returning to a military base from off-base leave or prior to leaving for a mission, and (iv) companies that would want to provide knowledge to their customers of their current alcohol level, such as lounge and bar owners, or customers attending a golfing event. We believe SOBR offers a unique solution to the national alcohol abuse problem. Currently, we have several “prototype” units fully developed that we believe are ready for use but are also constantly looking for ways to improve the device and will develop it further if we find improvements to the device. 

Regarding the use in vehicles, we believe SOBR offers a unique solution to the national drunk driving problem and are currently performing beta testing of SOBR for this use. Our objective is to grow our sales and manufacturing of SOBR by aggressively pursuing the original equipment market (“OEM”) once final beta testing is completed. We intend to seek an experienced OEM partner to introduce SOBR to the new automotive market. We believe that an increase in public awareness and consumer interest will generate a demand for alcohol sensing technology and we hope that auto manufactures will begin installing SOBR as a factory installed option. We will also market SOBR to international car manufacturers, which may want to gain a market advantage over domestic auto manufacturers. We will seek to enter other markets as well, such as commercial trucking, as well as seek to have included in federal legislation a requirement that a alcohol sensing devices with ignition locking systems be retrofitted in all vehicles in the U.S.

On October 29, 2018, we entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with First Capital Holdings, LLC (“FCH”). The LOI sets forth the terms under which we could potentially acquire certain assets related to robotics equipment from FCH in exchange for shares of our common stock equal to 60% of our then outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis. The LOI was non-binding and subject to various conditions that must be met in order for the parties to close the transaction, including, but not limited to, (i) TransBiotec being current in its reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) TransBiotec completing a reverse stock split of its common stock such that approximately 8,000,000 shares will be outstanding immediately prior to closing the transaction with no convertible instruments other than as set forth herein, (iii) TransBiotec having no more than $125,000 in outstanding debt, all in the form of convertible notes that mature in two years post-closing and are convertible into shares of TransBiotec common stock at $2.00 per share; (iv) FCH completing any necessary audits and reviews of the financial statements related to the assets by a PCAOB-approved independent registered accounting firm, and (v) the parties executing definitive documents related to the potential transaction.

On May 6, 2019, we signed a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with IDTEC, LLC, to acquire certain assets related to robotics equipment, which our management believes is synergistic with our current assets, from IDTEC in exchange for shares of our common stock equal to 60% of our then outstanding common stock. The APA is subject to several conditions precedent, primarily: (i) we must be current in our reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) we must complete a reverse stock split of our common stock such that approximately 8,000,000 shares will be outstanding immediately prior to closing the transaction with no convertible instruments other than as set forth in the APA and our authorized common stock must be reduced to 100,000,000 shares, (iii) we must not have more than approximately $150,000 in current liabilities, and (iv) IDTEC must complete any necessary audits and reviews of the financial statements related to the assets by a PCAOB-approved independent registered accounting firm. 

In advance of closing the transaction, IDTEC and a few other affiliated parties have been advancing funds to us and/or on our behalf for the costs related to the transaction, as well as for further developing and enhancing our current SOBR product. The funds advanced will be turned into promissory notes at the closing of the APA and are expected to be around $1 million by the time we close the transaction.

The description of the APA set forth in this report is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of that document, which is attached as Exhibit 10.6 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference. 

If the closing occurs, the assets being acquired under the APA are the same assets that were subject to the Letter of Intent with First Capital Holdings, LLC we previously announced our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on November 6, 2018.

Our only product is SOBR. The SOBR device is a patented device for use in detecting alcohol in a person’s system by measuring the ethanol content in their perspiration and determining whether that level is over or under a preset level set by the installer or a trained technician. SOBR works by having an individual touch a sensor for approximately six seconds, the sensor is specific to ethanol. It detects ethanol secreted through sweat that emanates from the hands. The product is produced in two basic forms. The first is an in-vehicle system that can be connected to an interlock system to prevent the operation of the vehicle in the event the sensor detects measurable ethanol content. The second product is a portable unit that can be used anywhere.

The in-vehicle unit can be in any machine, including automobiles, buses, trucks, boats and aircraft. Once the driver touches the sensor for approximately six seconds, the SOBR device detects ethanol secreted through sweat that emanates from the hands. If the vehicle is fitted with an interlock device, then the ethanol level is instantly translated into an engine "start" or "no-start" signal. SOBR can also initiate random real-time tests while the vehicle is operating to ensure that the operator's ethanol level does not increase over the preset limit after the vehicle is started. If the system is tampered with while parked, the vehicle will not start. If the device is tampered with while driving, alarms will activate, such as the vehicle lights and horn, drawing attention to the vehicle. If a vehicle is equipped with a Global Positioning System, or Data Transmission Module, SOBR can alert fleet operators or others monitoring a vehicle of the detection of alcohol above preset levels.

When SOBR is installed in a vehicle, the system is virtually unnoticeable, unlike breathalyzer ignition interlock systems. SOBR requires approximately one hour to install in a vehicle. The control box can be mounted under the dash in the interior of the vehicle. In new vehicles the sensor can be installed as part of the steering wheel. In retrofits, the sensor is installed on the dashboard for easy access. We believe that our cost to manufacture a SOBR device will be approximately $100, and if the unit is installed in a vehicle the installation cost will be approximately $75. We estimate a per unit sales price range of $500 to $550, SOBR requires a semi-annual recalibration much like current smog devices. The recalibration is accomplished with a hand held device plugged into the control box and requires a trained technician approximately one hour to complete.

We plan to license the installation and recalibration rights to the automotive service industry.

The portable unit is similar in size and looks to a black, non-flip mobile telephone and can be temporarily attached to a solid fixture for more convenient usage. The portable unit can be used to test individuals before they are allowed to perform certain functions. As a portable unit the system will signal through the use of lights whether the tested individual is over a preset level. The company utilizing the device may then use the information how it sees fit.

Marketing

We have developed a marketing plan that our management believes will gain market recognition, as well as hopefully generate demand, for the SOBR device, primarily through trade shows, industry publications, general solicitation, social media, and public relations. We plan to sell the SOBR device through the use of selling groups, such as channel sales, distributors, and independent sales contractors. We believe the primary market for the in-vehicle SOBR device initially is the commercial vehicle market, such as trucking companies, taxi cab companies, limousine companies, and bus companies. Many of these companies have a significant financial interest in eliminating drunk drivers from their operations. Secondarily, individuals may desire to monitor a family member's vehicle, such as an automobile operated by a minor or a family member with a past alcohol issue.

We believe the primary market for the portable SOBR device is its use by companies and institutions that have an interest in monitoring their employees’ or contractors’ alcohol level due to their job responsibilities, such as surgeons prior to entering surgery, pilots prior to flying aircraft, mineworkers prior to entering a mine, or the military for personnel returning to a military base from off-base leave.

As a result, we initially plan to market SOBR to the voluntary, commercial market:


o | commercial transportation companies that operate tractor trailers, taxis, construction vehicles, boats, trains, aircraft and other vehicles;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | local, state and federal government agencies that operate fire trucks, police cars and public transportation systems; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | individuals that desire to monitor a family member's vehicle, such as a vehicle operated by a minor.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | a variety of government and military employees, such as sailors in the Navy who might be tested before boarding a ship after off-base leave.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We plan to establish a distribution system of individuals and companies including value-added resellers (VARS), channel sales teams, and independent contractors, to sell the products to the market.

On July 10, 2014, we entered into a Master Distribution Agreement with A.G. Global Capital (“A.G. Global”), pursuant to which A.G. Capital will be the exclusive distributor of our SOBR alcohol testing device in the Republic of Turkey (“Turkey”), the Kingdom of Sweden (“Sweden”) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (“GCC”) comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Although we are still performing beta testing of SOBR, on January 15, 2016, we received a purchase order from our distributor, AG Global Capital, for 250 of our SOBR Ignition Interlock devices. These devices were for a trucking company located in Turkey. Under the terms of the purchase order we would receive $35,000 as payment for the devices once the devices are delivered. However, during 2016, the purchaser notified our distributor that they wish to put the purchase order on hold due to the political and social unrest in Turkey in order to see how things play out. In 2017, the deal terminated due to the unrest in that region of the world.

Manufacturing

We manufactured the prototype SOBR devices we have to date (approximately 10 devices) in-house from over-the-counter components. The primary part is the sensor, which is an over-the-counter sensor, which we program in-house with our proprietary programming to have the sensor perform the necessary functions in the SOBR device. Currently, we use one specific sensor from one manufacturer but we believe that we would be able to use other sensor in the event this manufacturer stopped selling the sensor we currently use.

Eventually, if we grow and need to mass manufacture the device, we are planning to manufacture of all components of the SOBR, as well as component assembly, through subcontracted to third parties and perform the final assembly, testing and calibration of the SOBR device at the company’s California location. In order to assemble the SOBR device, a manufacturer only needs the space, manpower, and common, non-exotic equipment.

We are actively working with outside engineering firms for testing and validation. We are progressing and encouraged with the initial findings. We have ongoing discussions with a couple of industrial design firms to work with us on the final design for the launch of the product. We expect to complete our final internal testing in 2019 and move forward with the steps necessary to bring a much-needed product to market. We had research and development costs during the year ended December 31, 2018, which are included in general and administrative expenses in the attached financial statements.

Competition

Currently, to our knowledge, breath analyzer ignition interlocks are the only products on the market that can detect alcohol and lock the ignition system of a vehicle. There are several limitations inherent with current design of breath analyzers that can be circumvented and are invasive in their appearance and use. At present, their market is substantially made up of the mandated market (the legal market as a punitive testing device). If breath analyzer sales occur outside the mandated market, to our knowledge, that represents a much smaller sales number as percentage of business.

We believe SOBR has the following advantages over the majority of traditional breath analyzers:


o | Can be programmed to work during the entire operation of the vehicle without distracting the driver; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | The system can be considered as non-invasive comparatively; 
o | Easy retro fit installation; 
o | Unobtrusive in the vehicle; 
o | Difficult to circumvent; 
o | Possible opportunity for the consumer to obtain insurance discounts that could offset some costs of the system. Although presently no insurance company is offering a premium discount, nor do we see that happening in the near future.


To date the breath analyzer companies are predominantly focused on the mandated market and are not pursuing the commercial market with the same effort.

Intellectual Property

As a portable unit, the system will signal through the use of lights that the tested individual is over a preset level.

When SOBR is installed in a vehicle the system is less noticeable than the most common breathalyzer ignition interlock systems. SOBR requires approximately one hour to install in a vehicle. The control box can be mounted under the dash in the interior of the vehicle. In new vehicles, the sensor can be installed as part of the steering wheel as well as many other places in the vehicle that are convenient easily assessable to the driver. In retrofits, the sensor is installed on the dashboard for easy access. We believe that our cost to manufacture a SOBR device will be approximately $100, and if the unit is installed in a vehicle, the installation cost will be approximately $75. SOBR requires a semi-annual recalibration much like current smog devices. The recalibration is accomplished with a hand held device plugged into the control box and requires a trained technician approximately one hour to complete.

We plan to license the installation and recalibration rights to various retail and service businesses in the automotive service industry.

SOBR is protected by the following three patents, filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 


1. | Patent 6620108, which expires on December 26, 2021, pertains to the technology that identifies the vehicle's operator.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Patent 7173536, which expires on August 28, 2024, pertains to the substance detection and alarm system.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Patent 7377186, which expires on April 6, 2025, pertains to the interface system between the substance detection system and vehicle ignition system. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. | Patent 9296298, which expires on December 9, 2034, pertains to an alcohol detection system for vehicle driver testing with integral temperature compensation.

Since we have not generated revenue to date from any of the above patents, and we are still in the developmental stage, we expensed the patent costs; therefore, they are not recognized as intangible assets on the balance sheet. 

Government Regulation

At the present time, only the judicially-mandated market is regulated. Devices sold into this market must be approved by state government agencies. Since we plan to enter this market last, we will not, initially, be subject to government regulation. However, we realize we would be subject to regulation if and when we were to enter the mandated market.

Regarding the use in vehicles, we believe SOBR offers a unique solution to the national drunk driving problem and have been and are continuing to perform beta testing of SOBR for this use. Our objective is to grow our sales and manufacturing of SOBR by aggressively pursuing the original equipment market (“OEM”) once final beta testing is completed. We intend to seek an experienced OEM partner to introduce SOBR to the new automotive market. We believe that an increase in public awareness and consumer interest as well as potential cost savings will generate a demand for alcohol sensing technology. We hope that auto manufactures will begin installing SOBR as a factory installed option. If that happens, we expect it would occur for some time in the future. We will also market SOBR to international car manufacturers that may want to gain a market advantage over domestic auto manufacturers. We will seek to enter other markets as well, such as commercial trucking, as well as seek to have included in federal legislation a requirement that alcohol sensing devices with ignition locking systems be retrofitted in all vehicles in the U.S. France is one country that has created laws that mandate vehicles to have an alcohol detection device on all private vehicles.

Regarding the use in monitoring employees and contractors in certain industries, such as surgeons, pilots and the military, we are in the process of meeting with potential customers in certain identified business segments.

Currently, we do not have the money or funding to achieve the above goals and we will not be able to achieve our goals unless we are successful in obtaining funding through this offering and potentially future offerings as well, all which may serve to dilute the ownership position of our current and future shareholders.

Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we do not have any employees. Our executive officers are independent contractors.
