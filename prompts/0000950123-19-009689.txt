ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 Founded in 1906, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (“SSI”), an Oregon corporation, is one of North America’s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products. Worldwide demand for recycled scrap metal is driven primarily by steel production levels, as recycled scrap metal is the primary feedstock for steel mill production using electric arc furnace (“EAF”) technology and one of the raw materials utilized for steel manufacturing using blast furnace technology. Steel mills around the world, including those in the North American domestic market in which our own steel mill operates, are the primary end markets for our ferrous recycled scrap metal. Specialty steelmakers, foundries, refineries, smelters, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors globally are the primary end markets for our nonferrous recycled scrap metal. Our steel mill in Oregon produces finished steel products using internally sourced recycled scrap metal as the primary raw material and sells to industrial customers primarily in North America.
SSI acquires and recycles auto bodies, rail cars, home appliances, industrial machinery, manufacturing scrap and construction and demolition scrap through its 96 auto and metals recycling facilities. We source material through well-developed, regional supply chains that collect scrap from large and small businesses and individuals. Our largest source of auto bodies is our own network of 51 retail self-service auto parts stores, which operate under the commercial brand-name Pick-n-Pull. The majority of our auto parts stores are located in close geographic proximity to our regional metals recycling operations which have large-scale shredders and deep water port access. The level of vertical integration of our auto parts stores and metals recycling operations provides for efficient processing of salvaged automobiles into recycled metal products for new metal production in steel mills and smelters globally or for further processing by other customers.

We utilize a variety of systems and technologies to process recycled metals ranging from iron and steel to aluminum, copper, brass, lead, stainless steel, zinc and other nonferrous metals for use in the manufacture of new or refined products. With scrap recycling facilities located in 23 States, Puerto Rico and Western Canada, we are well-positioned to efficiently acquire scrap metal throughout North America and deliver recycled metal products to customers around the world from our seven deep water ports, and also to our steel mill in Oregon. In fiscal 2019, we sold our products to customers located in 27 countries, including the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, and we sold to external customers or delivered to our steel mill an aggregate of 4.3 million tons of ferrous recycled scrap metal and sold 667 million pounds of nonferrous recycled scrap metal to external customers.
Our internal organizational and reporting structure includes two operating and reportable segments: the Auto and Metals Recycling (“AMR”) business and the Cascade Steel and Scrap (“CSS”) business.
AMR is our largest segment, representing 78% of our total revenues from sales to external customers in fiscal 2019. AMR generated 92% of its revenues in fiscal 2019 from sales of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal, with the remainder generated primarily from retail auto parts and other sales. AMR’s revenues from sales of recycled scrap metal, disaggregated by major product category, were 72% ferrous scrap metal and 28% nonferrous scrap metal in fiscal 2019. Our metals recycling operations reported within CSS also generate revenue from external sales of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal.
 CSS produces finished steel products such as rebar, wire rod, coiled rebar, merchant bar and other specialty products using ferrous recycled scrap metal primarily sourced internally from its metals recycling operations and other raw materials. CSS’s finished steel products are primarily used in nonresidential and infrastructure construction in North America. In fiscal 2019, CSS sold 478 thousand short tons of finished steel products.
 In fiscal 2019, we implemented productivity initiatives aimed at delivering $35 million in annual benefits in order to mitigate the weaker price environment in the ferrous and nonferrous markets. We expect these benefits to be achieved through a combination of production cost efficiencies, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and increases in retail auto parts sales. We achieved approximately $30 million of the total targeted benefits in fiscal 2019, with the full $35 million in annual benefits expected to be achieved in fiscal 2020.
 See Note 16 – Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the primary activities of each reportable segment, total assets by reportable segment, operating results from continuing operations by reportable segment, revenues from external customers and concentration of sales to foreign countries.

AMR
 Business
 AMR sells ferrous and nonferrous recycled scrap metal in both foreign and domestic markets. AMR acquires, processes and recycles auto bodies, rail cars, home appliances, industrial machinery, manufacturing scrap and construction and demolition scrap through its 91 auto and metals recycling facilities. Our largest source of auto bodies is our own network of retail auto parts stores, which operate under the commercial brand-name Pick-n-Pull. AMR procures salvaged vehicles and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through its 51 self-service auto parts stores located across the U.S. and Western Canada. Upon acquiring a salvaged vehicle, we remove catalytic converters, aluminum wheels and batteries for separate processing and sale prior to placing the vehicle in our retail lot. After retail customers have removed desired parts from a vehicle, we may remove remaining major component parts containing ferrous and nonferrous metals, which are primarily sold to wholesalers. The remaining auto bodies are crushed and shipped to our metals recycling facilities to be shredded, or sold to third parties where geographically more economical.
AMR processes mixed and large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by crushing, torching, shearing, shredding and sorting, resulting in scrap metal pieces of a size, density and metal content required by customers to meet their production needs. The manufacturing process includes physical separation of ferrous and nonferrous materials through automated and manual processes into various sub-classifications, each of which has a value and metal content used by our customers for their end products. One of the most efficient ways to process and sort recycled scrap metal is through the use of shredding and separation systems.
AMR operates six deep water port locations, five of which are equipped with large-scale shredders. AMR’s largest port facilities in Everett, Massachusetts; Oakland, California; and Tacoma, Washington each operate a mega-shredder with 7,000 to 9,000 horsepower. Our port facilities in Salinas, Puerto Rico and Kapolei, Hawaii each operate a shredder with 1,500 and 4,000 horsepower, respectively. Our port facility in Providence, Rhode Island does not operate a shredder, but exports ferrous recycled scrap metal acquired in the regional market. Our shredders are designed to provide a denser product and, in conjunction with advanced separation equipment, a more refined form of ferrous scrap metal which is used efficiently by steel mills in the production of new steel. The shredding process reduces auto bodies and other scrap metal into fist-size pieces of shredded recycled scrap metal. The shredded material is then carried by conveyor under magnetized drums that attract the ferrous scrap metal and separate it from the mixed nonferrous scrap metal and other residue, resulting in a consistent and high-quality shredded ferrous product. The mixed nonferrous scrap metal and residue then pass through a series of additional mechanical sorting systems designed to separate the nonferrous metal from the residue.

--------------------------------

 
The remaining mixed nonferrous metal is then further sorted by product and size grade before being sold as joint products, which include zorba (primarily aluminum), zurik (primarily stainless steel) and shredded insulated wire (primarily copper and aluminum). AMR invests in nonferrous metal extraction and separation technologies in order to maximize the recoverability of valuable nonferrous metal and to meet the metal purity requirements of customers. AMR also purchases nonferrous metal directly from industrial vendors and other suppliers and aggregates and prepares this metal for shipment to customers by ship, rail or truck.
 In addition to the sale of recycled metal products processed at our facilities, AMR also brokers the sale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal generated by industrial entities and demolition projects to customers in the domestic market.
 Products
 AMR’s primary products consist of recycled ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal. Ferrous recycled scrap metal is a key feedstock used in the production of finished steel and is largely categorized into heavy melting steel (“HMS”), plate and structural (“bonus”) and shredded scrap (“shred”), although there are various grades of each category depending on metal content and the size and consistency of individual pieces. These attributes affect the product’s relative value. Our nonferrous products include mixed metal joint products recovered from the shredding process, such as zorba, zurik and shredded insulated wire, as well as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, nickel, brass, titanium, lead, and high temperature alloys. We also sell catalytic converters to specialty processors that extract the nonferrous precious metals including platinum, palladium and rhodium.
Prior to the shredding process, AMR sells serviceable used auto parts from salvaged vehicles through its self-service auto parts stores located across the U.S. and Western Canada. Each retail self-service store offers an extensive selection of vehicles (including domestic and foreign cars, vans and light trucks) from which customers can remove and purchase parts. We employ proprietary information technology systems to centrally manage and operate the geographically diverse network of auto parts stores, and we regularly rotate the inventory to provide customers with greater access to parts. In general, we believe the list prices of auto parts at our self-service stores are significantly lower than those offered at full-service auto dismantlers, retail car parts stores and car dealerships.
Customers
 AMR sells its ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal products globally to steel mills, foundries, refineries, smelters, wholesalers and other recycled metal processors. AMR’s self-service auto parts stores also serve retail customers seeking to obtain serviceable used auto parts at a competitive price. Retail customers remove the parts without the assistance of store employees and pay a listed price for the part. AMR also supplies a small portion of its scrap metal to CSS’s shredding operation in Portland, Oregon, the substantial majority of which is processed and delivered to CSS’s steel mill.

 In fiscal 2019, the five countries from which AMR derived its largest revenues from external customers were the United States, Bangladesh, Turkey, Vietnam, and South Korea which collectively accounted for 76% of total AMR external revenues. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, the five countries from which AMR derived its largest revenues from external customers accounted for 75% and 81%, respectively, of total AMR external revenues. We generally attribute revenues from external customers to individual countries based on the country in which the customer is located.
 AMR’s five largest external ferrous scrap metal customers accounted for 37% of external recycled ferrous metal revenues in fiscal 2019, compared to 33% and 31% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. AMR had no external customers that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.

Total sales volumes of ferrous scrap metal vary from year-to-year due to the level of demand, availability of supply, general economic conditions, infrastructure spending, relative currency values, availability of credit and other factors. Ferrous scrap metal sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and nearly all of our large shipments of ferrous scrap metal to foreign customers have historically been supported by letters of credit.
 The table below sets forth, on a revenue and volume basis, the amount of recycled ferrous scrap metal sold by AMR to foreign and domestic customers, including sales to CSS, during the last three fiscal years ended August 31:

 AMR’s retail auto parts sales accounted for less than 10% of SSI’s consolidated revenues in each of the periods presented.
 Pricing
 Domestic and foreign prices for ferrous and nonferrous recycled scrap metal are generally based on prevailing market rates, which differ by region, and are subject to market cycles that are influenced by worldwide demand from steel and other metal producers as well as by the availability of materials that can be processed into saleable scrap metal, among other factors. Sanctions and trade actions, including tariffs, quotas and restrictions or bans on access to certain markets and licensing and inspection requirements can also impact pricing for the affected products. Ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal sales contracts generally provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed to which, in most cases, includes freight.
 AMR responds to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on its operating income. The spread between selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap metal (metal spread) is subject to a number of factors, including differences in the market conditions between the domestic regions where scrap metal is acquired and the areas in the world to which the processed metals are sold, market volatility from the time the selling price is agreed upon with the customer until the time the scrap metal is purchased, and changes in transportation costs. We believe AMR generally benefits from sustained periods of stable or rising recycled scrap metal selling prices, which allow it to better maintain or increase both operating income and scrap metal flow into its facilities. When recycled scrap metal selling prices decline, particularly for a sustained period, AMR’s operating margins typically compress.
The sales prices for auto parts from salvaged vehicles are deeply discounted from prevailing national new and refurbished sales prices offered at full-service auto dismantlers, retail auto parts stores and car dealerships. Our stores provide a list price, available at each location and online. Prices for auto bodies sold to third parties and for major component parts, such as engines, transmissions and alternators sold to wholesalers, are based on prevailing scrap market rates which differ by region and are subject to market cycles. Prices for catalytic converters sold to third-party processors are based on prevailing market rates for the extracted precious metals including platinum, palladium and rhodium. By consolidating shipments of auto bodies and component parts, we are able to optimize prices by focusing on larger wholesale customers that pay a premium for volume and consistency of shipments.

Markets
 Global production of finished steel products drives demand for materials used in the steel-making process, including ferrous recycled scrap metal which is the primary feedstock used in EAFs and can also be used in blast furnaces to manufacture steel. AMR exports ferrous recycled scrap metal primarily to countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region and North, Central and South America. Ferrous exports made up 66%, 71% and 70% of AMR’s total ferrous sales volume in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe long-term demand for recycled metals will continue to be driven by factors including global economic growth and an increased focus on environmental policies promoting natural resource conservation, lower greenhouse gas emissions and lower energy costs. We believe the significant environmental benefits and production efficiencies associated with EAF steel-making, which uses scrap metal as a primary raw material, compared to blast furnace steel-making, which primarily uses iron ore mined from natural resources, will positively contribute to worldwide long-term demand for ferrous recycled scrap metal.
Nonferrous exports made up 60%, 63% and 59% of AMR’s total nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The substantial majority of AMR’s nonferrous joint products recovered from the shredding process are sold to the export market and comprise in the range of 40% to 45% of AMR’s total nonferrous sales volumes. China has historically been the primary destination for our nonferrous exports, representing 39%, 64% and 76% of AMR’s total nonferrous export sales volumes in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The concentration of AMR’s combined nonferrous exports to countries in Asia other than China and to Europe increased in fiscal 2019 and 2018 primarily in response to new regulations, increased inspection and licensing requirements, import quotas and tariffs on U.S. scrap imports put in place by China beginning in fiscal 2018.
Distribution
AMR delivers recycled ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal to foreign customers by ship and to domestic customers by barge, rail and road transportation networks. Cost efficiencies are achieved by operating deep water terminal facilities in Everett, Massachusetts; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Providence, Rhode Island, all of which are owned, except for the Providence, Rhode Island facility which is operated under a long-term lease. We also have access to deep water terminal facilities at Kapolei, Hawaii and Salinas, Puerto Rico through public docks. The use of deep water terminals enables us to load ferrous material in large vessels capable of holding up to 50,000 tons for trans-oceanic shipments. We believe the use of our owned and leased terminal facilities is advantageous because it allows us to more effectively manage loading costs and minimize the berthing delays often experienced by users of unaffiliated terminals. From time to time, AMR may enter into contracts of affreightment, which guarantee the availability of ocean going vessels, in order to manage the risks associated with ship availability and freight costs.
Our nonferrous products are shipped in 20- to 30-ton capacity containers from ports and rail ramps located in close proximity to our recycling facilities. Containerized shipments are exported by marine vessels to customers globally, and domestic shipments are typically shipped to customers by rail or by truck.
AMR sells used auto parts from its self-service retail stores. Both before and after retail customers have removed desired parts from acquired salvaged vehicles, we extract and consolidate certain valuable ferrous and nonferrous components from auto bodies for shipment by truck primarily to wholesale customers. We also remove and collect catalytic converters from salvaged vehicles for shipment by truck to specialty processers which extract the nonferrous precious metals. The salvaged auto bodies are crushed and shipped by truck to our metals recycling facilities where geographically feasible, or to third-party recyclers, for shredding.
Sources of Unprocessed Metal
 The most common forms of purchased unprocessed metal are obsolete machinery and equipment, such as automobiles, railroad cars, railroad tracks, home appliances and other consumer goods, waste metal from manufacturing operations and demolition metal from buildings and other infrastructure. Unprocessed metal is acquired from a diverse base of suppliers who unload at our facilities, from drop boxes at suppliers’ industrial sites, and through negotiated purchases from other large suppliers, including railroads, manufacturers, automobile salvage facilities, metal dealers, various government entities and individuals. We typically seek to locate our retail auto parts stores in major population centers with convenient road access. Our auto parts store network spans 15 states in the U.S. and two provinces in Western Canada, with a majority of the stores concentrated in regions where our large shredders are located. Through our network of auto parts stores, we seek to obtain salvaged vehicles from five primary sources: private parties, tow companies, charities, auto auctions and municipal and other contracts. AMR has a program to purchase vehicles from private parties called “Cash for Junk Cars” which is advertised in local markets. Private parties either call a toll-free number and receive a quote for their vehicle or obtain an instant online quote. The private party can either deliver the vehicle to one of our retail locations or arrange for the vehicle to be picked up. AMR also employs car buyers who travel to vendors and bid on vehicles. Further, AMR enters into limited duration contracts with public entities and other third parties for vehicle dismantling and disposal services, which provide a source of low-cost salvage vehicles. The expiration of such contracts may lead us to seek alternative sources of vehicles, potentially at a higher cost.

The majority of AMR’s scrap metal collection and processing facilities receive unprocessed metal via major railroad routes, waterways or highways. Metals recycling facilities situated near industrial manufacturing and major transportation routes have the competitive advantage of reduced freight costs because of the significant cost of freight relative to the cost of metal. The locations of AMR’s West Coast facilities provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in the Northern California region, northward to Western Canada and Alaska, and to the East, including Idaho, Montana, Utah, Colorado and Nevada. The locations of the East Coast facilities provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in New York, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Eastern Canada and, from time to time, the Midwest. In the Southeastern U.S., approximately half of AMR’s ferrous and nonferrous unprocessed metal volume is purchased from industrial companies, including auto manufacturers, with the remaining volume being purchased from smaller dealers and individuals. These industrial companies provide AMR with metals that are by-products of their manufacturing processes.
The supply of scrap metal from these various sources can fluctuate with the level of economic activity in the U.S. and can be sensitive to variability in scrap metal prices, particularly in the short term. The supply of scrap metal can also fluctuate, to a lesser degree, due to seasonal factors, such as severe weather conditions, which can inhibit scrap metal collections at our facilities and production levels in our yards. Severe weather conditions can also adversely impact the timing of shipments of our products, the level of manufacturing activity utilizing our products, and retail admissions at our auto parts stores.
Backlog
 As of September 30, 2019, AMR had a backlog of orders to sell $104 million of export ferrous metal compared to $86 million at the same time in the prior year primarily due to the timing of sales. Additionally, as of September 30, 2019, AMR had a backlog of orders to sell $28 million of export nonferrous metal compared to $34 million at the same time in the prior year primarily reflecting lower average selling prices. We expect to fill the entirety of the backlog of orders for export ferrous and nonferrous metal during fiscal 2020.
 Competition
 AMR competes in the U.S. and in Western Canada for the purchase of scrap metal with large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal, steel mills that own scrap yards, and with smaller metals facilities and dealers. AMR’s auto stores compete for the purchase of end-of-life vehicles with other auto dismantlers, used car dealers, auto auctions and metals recyclers. In general, the competitive factors impacting the purchase of scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles are the price offered by the purchaser, the proximity of the purchaser to the source of scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles, and the purchaser’s ability to efficiently collect the scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles from certain suppliers’ locations. AMR also competes with brokers that buy scrap metal on behalf of domestic and foreign steel mills.
Demand for AMR’s products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors. AMR competes globally for the sale of processed recycled metal to finished steel and other metal product producers. The predominant competitive factors that impact recycled metal sales are price (including duties and shipping cost), reliability of service, product quality, the relative value of the U.S. dollar and the availability and price of raw material alternatives, including scrap metal substitutes such as pig iron and direct-reduced iron (both derived from iron ore), and semi-finished products, such as steel billets. Our ability to compete in certain export markets may be impacted by sanctions and trade actions, such as tariffs, quotas and other import restrictions, and by licensing and inspection requirements. Such restrictions may require us to perform additional processing and packaging of certain nonferrous recycled scrap metal products, as well as engage in increased inspection and certification activities, in order to continue selling into the affected markets.
AMR also competes for the sale of used auto parts to retail customers with other self-service and full-service auto dismantlers. The auto parts industry is characterized by diverse and fragmented competition and comprises a large number of aftermarket and used auto parts suppliers of all sizes, ranging from large, multinational corporations which serve both original equipment manufacturers and the aftermarket on a worldwide basis to small, local entities which have more limited supply. The main competitive factors impacting the retail sale of auto parts are price, availability and visibility of product, quality and convenience of the retail stores to customers.
AMR’s ability to process substantial volumes of scrap metal products, advanced processing equipment, number and geographic dispersion of locations, access to a variety of different modes of transportation, and the operating synergies of its integrated platform provide its business with the ability to compete successfully in varying market conditions.

CSS
 Business
 CSS operates a steel mini-mill in McMinnville, Oregon that produces a range of finished steel long products such as reinforcing bar (rebar) and wire rod. The primary feedstock for the manufacture of its products is ferrous recycled scrap metal. CSS’s steel mill obtains substantially all of its scrap metal raw material requirements from its integrated metals recycling and joint venture operations. CSS’s metals recycling operations comprise a collection, shredding and export operation in Portland, Oregon, four feeder yard operations located in Oregon and Southern Washington, and one metals recycling joint venture ownership interest. Additionally, CSS purchases small volumes of ferrous scrap metal from AMR and sells ferrous and nonferrous recycled scrap metal primarily into the export market. CSS’s revenues from external sales of recycled scrap metal account for less than 10% of SSI’s consolidated revenues in all of the periods presented.
Manufacturing
CSS’s melt shop includes an EAF, a ladle refining furnace with enhanced steel chemistry refining capabilities, and a five-strand continuous billet caster, permitting the mill to produce special alloy grades of steel not currently produced by other mills on the West Coast of the U.S. The melt shop produced 537 thousand, 561 thousand and 489 thousand short tons of steel in the form of billets during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The substantial majority of these billets are reheated in a natural gas-fueled furnace and are then hot-rolled through the rolling mill to produce finished steel products. The rolling mill has an effective annual production capacity under current conditions of approximately 580 thousand tons of finished steel products.
Our steel mill has an operating permit issued under Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which governs certain air quality standards. The permit is based on an annual production capacity of approximately 950 thousand tons. The permit was first issued in 1998 and has since been renewed through February 1, 2018. The permit renewal process occurs every five years, and the renewal process is underway; however, the existing permit is extended by administrative rule until the current renewal process is finalized.
Products
 CSS produces semi-finished goods (billets) and finished goods, consisting of rebar, coiled rebar, wire rod, merchant bar and other specialty products. Semi-finished goods are predominantly used for CSS’s finished products, but also have been produced for sale to other steel mills. Rebar is produced in either straight length steel bars or coils and used to increase the strength of poured concrete. Coiled rebar is preferred by some manufacturers because it reduces the waste generated by cutting individual lengths to meet customer specifications and, therefore, improves yield. Wire rod is steel rod, delivered in coiled form, used by manufacturers to produce a variety of products such as chain link fencing, nails, wire, stucco netting, and pre-stressed concrete strand. Merchant bar consists of rounds and square steel bars used by manufacturers to produce a wide variety of products, including bolts, threaded bars, and dowel bars. CSS is also certified to produce high-quality rebar to support nuclear power plant construction and has a license to produce certain patented high-strength specialty steels. CSS monitors the market for new products in order to identify opportunities to expand its product lines and sales.

Customers
 CSS’s finished steel customers are primarily steel service centers, construction industry subcontractors, steel fabricators, wire drawers and major farm and wood products suppliers. During fiscal 2019, CSS sold its finished steel products to customers located primarily in the Western U.S. and Western Canada. Customers in California accounted for 54%, 48%, and 53% of CSS’s steel revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. CSS’s ten largest steel customers accounted for 49%, 46% and 51% of its steel revenues during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No CSS steel customer accounted for 10% or more of SSI’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.
The metals recycling operations within CSS also sell ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal products to external customers comprising primarily steel mills, foundries, refineries, smelters and other recycled metal processors in Asia.
Pricing
 CSS’s finished steel product prices differ by product size and grade. Selling prices are influenced by the price of raw materials, including the cost of recycled ferrous scrap metal and required consumables including graphite electrodes and alloys, as well as regional demand in the West Coast market. Selling prices for our finished steel products may also be affected by the price and availability of steel imports.
 Distribution
 CSS sells finished steel products directly from its mini-mill in McMinnville, Oregon and its owned distribution center in City of Industry, California (Los Angeles area). Finished steel products are shipped from the mini-mill to the distribution center primarily by rail. The distribution center facilitates sales by maintaining an inventory of products close to major customers for just-in-time delivery. CSS communicates regularly with major customers to determine their anticipated needs and plans its rolling mill production schedule accordingly. Finished steel shipments to customers are made by common carrier, primarily truck or rail.
 CSS delivers recycled ferrous scrap metal to export customers by bulk ship using its deep water terminal facility in Portland, Oregon, and nonferrous recycled scrap metal to export customers in containers by ship.
 Supply of Scrap Metal
 We believe CSS operates the only mini-mill in the Western U.S. that obtains its scrap metal requirements from an integrated metals recycler. CSS’s metals recycling operations provide its steel mill with a mix of recycled metal grades, which allows the mill to achieve optimum efficiency in its melting operations.
Energy Supply
 CSS needs electricity to run its steel manufacturing operations, primarily its EAF. CSS purchases electricity under a long-term contract with McMinnville Water & Light (“MW&L”), which in turn relies on the Bonneville Power Administration. We entered into our current contract with MW&L in October 2011 that will expire in September 2028.
 CSS’s steel manufacturing operations also need natural gas to run its reheat furnace, which is used to reheat billets prior to running them through the rolling mill. CSS meets this demand through a natural gas agreement with a utility provider that obligates CSS at each month-end to purchase a volume of gas based on its projected needs for the immediately subsequent month on a take-or-pay basis priced using published natural gas indices. 
 Energy costs represented 5%, 4%, and 5% of CSS’s cost of goods sold in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Backlog
 As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, CSS had a backlog of finished steel orders of $14 million and $33 million, respectively. We expect to fill the entirety of the backlog of orders for finished steel products during fiscal 2020.
 Competition
 The primary domestic competitors of CSS for the sale of finished steel products include Nucor Corporation’s manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Utah and Washington, and Commercial Metals Company’s manufacturing facilities in Arizona and California. In addition to domestic competition, CSS competes with foreign steel producers, principally located in Asia, Canada, Mexico and Central and South America, primarily in shorter length rebar and certain wire rod grades. The principal competitive factors in CSS’s market are price, quality, service, product availability and the relative value of the U.S. dollar.

For more than a decade, CSS’s steel manufacturing operation, as part of a U.S. industry coalition, petitioned the U.S. Government under our international trade laws for relief in the form of antidumping and countervailing duties against wire rod and rebar products from a number of foreign countries. Many of those cases were successful and led to a decrease in finished steel imports into CSS’s domestic markets from the peak reached in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2019, antidumping duty orders were in effect related to imports of rebar from Belarus, China, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, Moldova, Poland, Taiwan, Turkey and Ukraine; a countervailing duty order was in effect related to imports of rebar from Turkey; antidumping duty orders were in effect related to imports of wire rod from Belarus, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Moldova, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Trinidad and Tobago; and countervailing duty orders were in effect related to imports of wire rod from Brazil, China, Italy, and Turkey.
The duties imposed as part of these orders are periodically reassessed through the administrative review process. In addition, every five years the U.S. Government conducts sunset reviews to determine whether revocation of the orders would likely lead to resumption of dumping and subsidization and negatively impact the U.S. domestic industry. Affirmative decisions allow the orders to continue for an additional five years. The sunset review for rebar from Belarus, China, Indonesia, Latvia, Moldova, Poland and Ukraine was initiated in June 2018 and, following an affirmative sunset decision in October 2018, orders covering these countries remain in place for another five years. The third sunset review covering wire rod from Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Moldova and Trinidad and Tobago, was initiated in June 2019 and is pending. The first sunset review covering rebar from Mexico and Turkey (from the 2014 investigation) will commence in October 2019.
There are antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect in Canada covering rebar from Belarus, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, Spain and Turkey that we expect will continue to lead to a reduction in the volume of imports into Canada from these countries.
The long-term effectiveness of existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders related to imports of wire rod and rebar products is largely uncertain and is impacted by the U.S. Government’s ability to efficiently identify and respond to violations of U.S. international trade laws affecting CSS’s steel manufacturing operations.
 In March 2018, the President of the United States imposed tariffs in the amount of 25 percent and 10 percent on imports of certain steel and aluminum products, respectively. The imposition of the tariffs was the conclusion of an investigation started in April 2017 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that allows for an exemption from normal international trade rules if imports of a product are harming national security. Currently, imports from Argentina, Australia, Brazil and South Korea are exempt from these duties pursuant to various agreements, including quotas. In May 2019, the President announced an agreement with Canada and Mexico that eliminated the Section 232 tariffs on steel from those countries. As part of the agreement, Mexico and Canada also suspended their retaliatory duties on U.S. imports. The elimination of the 25% duty on U.S.-origin steel imports into Canada has allowed CSS to resume shipping steel to Western Canada. Sales of finished steel products to customers in Canada represented 3%, 7%, and 6% of our steel mill’s external sales in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The European Union continues to impose retaliatory duties on U.S.-origin steel imports. The Department of Commerce also implemented an exclusion process whereby U.S. entities can request that certain products be excluded from the Section 232 tariffs. CSS reviews any exclusion requests relevant to its product line to determine whether an objection might be appropriate.

Environmental Matters
 Impact of Legislation and Regulation
 Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our operations. Our businesses are subject to extensive local, state and federal environmental protection, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations relating to, among others:

• | Remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The discharge of materials and emissions into the air;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | The prevention and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The management, treatment and discharge of wastewater and storm water;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Climate change;
--+----------------


• | The generation, discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and secondary materials; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The protection of our employees’ health and safety.
--+----------------------------------------------------

These environmental laws regulate, among other things, the release and discharge of hazardous materials into the air, water and ground; exposure to hazardous materials; and the identification, storage, treatment, handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
 Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international regulatory and legislative initiatives to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) was authorized to regulate carbon dioxide under the U.S. Clean Air Act. The EPA subsequently initiated a series of regulatory efforts aimed at addressing greenhouse gases as pollutants, including finding that GHG emissions endanger public health, implementing mandatory GHG emission reporting requirements, and setting carbon emission standards for light-duty vehicles.
 Environmental legislation and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years, and it is likely that we will be subject to even more stringent environmental standards in the future. Legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress to address GHG emissions and global climate change, including “cap and trade” programs, and some form of federal climate change legislation or additional federal regulation is possible. A number of states, including states in which we have operations and facilities, have considered, are considering or have already enacted legislation to develop information or address climate change and GHG emissions, including state-level “cap and trade” programs. Currently, we are required to annually report GHG emissions from our steel mill to the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the EPA.
Although our objective is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we have, in the past, been found to be not in compliance with certain environmental laws and regulations and have incurred liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with such violations. In December 2000, we were notified by the EPA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties that owns or operates, or formerly owned or operated, sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. See discussion in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
In fiscal 2019, capital expenditures related to environmental projects were $36 million, and we expect to spend in the range of $15 million on capital expenditures related to environmental projects in fiscal 2020.
Indirect Consequences of Future Legislation and Regulation
 Future legislation or increased regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with laws and regulations concerning and limitations imposed on climate change and GHG emissions. The potential costs of allowances, taxes, fees, offsets or credits that may be part of “cap and trade” programs or similar future legislative or regulatory measures are still uncertain, and the future of these programs or measures is unknown. Any adopted future climate change and GHG laws or regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to or complying with such requirements. Furthermore, even without such laws or regulations, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the metals recycling and steel manufacturing industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our products.
GHG legislation and regulation is expected to have an effect on the price of electricity, especially electricity generated using carbon-based fuels. Since the electricity supply for CSS includes a significant element of hydro-generated production which is not subject to GHG legislation and regulation, CSS’s energy costs are less likely to be impacted than those of competitors using electricity generated by carbon-based fuels. In addition, demand for scrap metal may increase from mills with blast furnaces as they seek to maximize the scrap metal component of raw material infeed, which requires less energy than melting iron ore.
Since the use of recycled iron and steel instead of iron ore to make new steel results in savings in the consumption of energy, virgin materials and water and reduces mining wastes, we believe our recycled metal products position us to be more competitive in the future for business from companies wishing to reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the environment. In addition, the EAF at our steel mill generates significantly less GHG emissions than traditional blast furnaces.

Physical Impacts of Climate Change on Our Costs and Operations
 There has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with rising sea levels as well as extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms. Extreme weather conditions may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. As many of our recycling facilities are located near deep water ports, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to receive scrap metal, process the scrap metal through our shredders and ship products to our customers. Periods of extended adverse weather conditions may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Potential adverse impacts from climate change, including rising temperatures and extreme weather conditions, may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an inability to maintain standard operating hours.
Employees
As of September 30, 2019, we had 3,363 full-time employees, consisting of 2,581 employees at AMR, 595 employees at CSS and 187 corporate administrative and shared services employees. Of these employees, 735 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Cascade Steel Rolling Mills contract with the United Steelworkers of America, which covers 279 of these employees, was renewed and ratified in October 2019 and will expire on March 31, 2022. We believe that in general our labor relations are good.
