ITEM 1.     BUSINESS 
Overview
 
Founded in 1932 and incorporated in Delaware in 1989, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ethan Allen Global, Inc., and Ethan Allen Global, Inc.’s subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ethan Allen” or the “Company”), is a leading interior design company, manufacturer and retailer in the home furnishings marketplace. Today we are a global luxury international home fashion brand that is vertically integrated from design through delivery, which affords our clientele a value proposition of style, quality and price. We provide complimentary interior design service to our customers and sell a full range of furniture products and decorative accents through a retail network of approximately 300 design centers in the United States and abroad as well as online at ethanallen.com. The design centers represent a mix of independent licensees and Company-owned and operated locations. We own and operate six manufacturing facilities, including three manufacturing plants and one sawmill in the United States and one upholstery manufacturing plant in Mexico and one case goods manufacturing plant in Honduras.
Business Strategy
 
Our strategy has been to position Ethan Allen as a preferred brand offering complimentary design service together with products of superior style, quality and value to provide consumers with a comprehensive, one-stop shopping solution for their home furnishing and interior design needs. In carrying out our strategy, we continue to expand our reach to a broader consumer base through a diverse selection of attractively priced products, designed to complement one another, reflecting current fashion trends in home decorating. We continuously monitor changes in home fashion trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal market research, and regular communication with our retailers and design center design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer trends. We believe that the observations and input gathered enable us to incorporate appropriate style details into our products to react quickly to changing consumer tastes.
Product

The majority of the products we sell are built by artisans in our North American plants. Most upholstery frames are hand-assembled and stitching is guided by hand. We select international partners who are as committed to quality and social responsibility as we are. All case goods frames are made with premium lumber and veneers. We use best-in-class construction techniques, including mortise and tenon joinery and four-corner glued dovetail joinery on drawers. We combine technology with personal service and maintain an up-to-date broad range of styles and custom options in keeping with today’s home decorating trends. These factors continue to define Ethan Allen, positioning us as a fashion leader in the home furnishing industry.
 
The interior of our design centers, which have been substantially refreshed during the past three fiscal years, are organized to facilitate display of our product offerings, both in room settings that project the category lifestyle and by product grouping to facilitate comparisons of the styles and tastes of our customers. To further enhance the experience, technology is used to expand the range of products viewed by including content from our website and 3-D digital images in applications used on large touch-screen flat panel displays.
 
Product Development
 
Using a combination of employees and designers, we design the majority of the products we sell. All of our products are Ethan Allen branded. This important facet of our vertically integrated business enables us to control the design specifications and establish consistent levels of quality across all our product programs. In addition to our four United States manufacturing facilities, we have an upholstery manufacturing facility in Mexico and a case goods manufacturing facility in Honduras. Approximately 75% of our products are manufactured or assembled in these North American facilities. We selectively outsource the remaining 25% of our products, primarily from Asia. We carefully select our sourcing partners and require strict compliance with our specifications and quality standards. We believe that strategic investments in our manufacturing facilities balanced with outsourcing from foreign and domestic suppliers would enable us to accommodate any significant future sales growth and allow us to maintain an appropriate degree of control over cost, quality and service to our customers.
Raw Materials and Other Suppliers 
 
The most important raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing are lumber, veneers, plywood, hardware, glue, finishing materials, glass, laminates, steel, fabrics, foam, and filling material. The various types of wood used in our products include cherry, ash, oak, maple, prima vera, African mahogany, birch, rubber wood and poplar.

Fabrics and other raw materials are purchased both domestically and outside the United States . We have no significant long-term supply contracts, and have sufficient alternate sources of supply to prevent disruption in supplying our operations. We maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, which we believe contribute to our ability to obtain competitive pricing. Lumber prices and availability fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand. The cost of some of our raw materials such as foam and shipping costs are dependent on petroleum cost. Higher material prices, cost of petroleum, and costs of sourced products could have an adverse effect on margins.
 
Appropriate amounts of lumber and fabric inventory are typically stocked to maintain adequate production levels. We believe that our sources of supply for these materials are sufficient and that we are not dependent on any one supplier.
 
We enter into standard purchase agreements with foreign and domestic suppliers to source selected products. The terms of these arrangements are customary for the industry and do not contain any long-term contractual obligations on our behalf. We believe we maintain good relationships with our suppliers. 
 
Segments 
 
We have strategically aligned our business into two reportable segments: Wholesale and Retail. These two segments represent strategic business areas of our vertically integrated enterprise that operate separately and provide their own distinctive services. This vertical structure enables us to offer our complete line of home furnishings and accents while controlling quality and cost. We evaluate performance of the respective segments based upon net sales and operating income. Inter-segment transactions result, primarily, from the wholesale sale of inventory to the retail segment, including the related profit margin. Financial information, including sales, operating income and long-lived assets related to our segments are disclosed in Note 19, Segment Information, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company operated 144 design centers (our retail segment) and our independent retailers operated 158 design centers. Our wholesale segment net sales include sales to our retail segment, which are eliminated in consolidation, sales to our independent retailers and unaffiliated third parties.
 
The following charts depict net sales related to our reportable segments.
 


We believe that the demand for furniture generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence, housing market conditions and unemployment rates. For both our segments, the second and fourth quarters are historically the seasonally highest-volume sales quarters. However, during fiscal 2019, we experienced our largest sales volume quarter for our wholesale business during the first quarter while our retail segment had its highest sales volume during the second quarter. We believe this fiscal 2019 experience was not an indicator that our seasonal trends are changing.
 
Retail Segment
 
The retail segment, which accounted for 79% of net sales during fiscal 2019, sells home furnishings and accents to consumers through a network of Company operated design centers. Retail revenue is generated upon the retail sale and delivery of our products to our retail customers through our network of service centers. Retail profitability reflects (i) the retail gross margin, which represents the difference between the retail net sales price and the cost of goods, purchased primarily from the wholesale segment, and (ii) other operating costs associated with retail segment activities.
 
We measure the performance of our design centers based on net sales and written orders booked on a comparable period basis. Comparable design centers are those which have been operating for at least 15 months, including relocated design centers provided the original and relocated design center location had been operating for at least 15 months on a combined basis. During the first three months of operations of newly opened design centers, written orders are booked but minimal net sales are achieved through the delivery of products. Design centers we acquire from independent retailers are included in comparable design center sales in their 13th full month of Ethan Allen-owned operations. The frequency of our promotional events as well as the timing of the end of those events can also affect the comparability of orders booked during a given period. Due to the nature of the business in which the retail segment operates, there are no customer concentration risks.

The retail segment’s product line revenue, expressed as a percentage of net sales, is comprised of approximately 48% in upholstered products, 30% case goods and the remaining 22% in home accents and other.
 
During fiscal 2019, we acquired two new design centers in the United States from independent retailers and closed six locations, which is net of three relocations. The geographic distribution of retail design center locations is disclosed under Item 2, Properties, contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Wholesale Segment
 
The wholesale segment, which accounted for 21% of net sales during fiscal 2019, is principally involved in the development of the Ethan Allen brand and encompasses all aspects of design, manufacture, sourcing, marketing, sale and distribution of our broad range of home furnishings and accents. Wholesale revenue is generated upon the sale and shipment of our products to our retail network of independently operated design centers, Company operated design centers and other contract customers. Sales to ten of our largest customers accounted for 21% of revenues within our wholesale segment during fiscal 2019.
 
Within the wholesale segment, we maintain revenue information according to each respective product line (i.e. case goods, upholstery, and home accents). Case goods include items such as beds, dressers, armoires, tables, chairs, buffets, entertainment units, home office furniture, and wooden accents. Upholstery items include sleepers, recliners and other motion furniture, chairs, ottomans, custom pillows, sofas, loveseats, cut fabrics and leather. Skilled artisans cut, sew and upholster custom-designed upholstery items which are available in a variety of frame, fabric and trim options. Home accent items include window treatments and drapery hardware, wall decor, florals, lighting, clocks, mattresses, bedspreads, throws, pillows, decorative accents, area rugs, wall coverings and home and garden furnishings.
 
Wholesale profitability includes (i) the wholesale gross margin, which represents the difference between the wholesale net sales price and the cost associated with manufacturing and/or sourcing the related product, and (ii) other operating costs associated with wholesale segment activities.
 
The wholesale segment’s product line revenue, expressed as a percentage of net sales, is comprised of approximately 50% in upholstered products, 33% case goods and the remaining 17% in home accents and other.
 
As of June 30, 2019, our wholesale backlog was $46.4 million (as compared to $56.5 million as of June 30, 2018) which is anticipated to be serviced in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our backlog was down 18.0% as our manufacturing operations returned to normal throughput as compared to the prior year’s longer production lead-times primarily related to the GSA contract startup. Our wholesale backlog fluctuates based on the timing of net orders booked, manufacturing schedules and efficiency, the timing of sourced product receipts, the timing and volume of wholesale shipments, and the timing of various promotional events. Because orders may be rescheduled and/or canceled and the sourcing timing may change, the measure of backlog at a point in time is not necessarily indicative of future sales performance.
 
Our independent retailers are required to enter into license agreements with us, which (i) authorize the use of certain Ethan Allen trademarks and (ii) require adherence to certain standards of operation, including a requirement to fulfill related warranty service agreements. We are not subject to any territorial or exclusive retailer agreements in North America.
 
The geographic distribution of manufacturing and distribution locations is disclosed under Item 2, Properties, contained in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Talent
 
Since our founding, we have built a collaborative culture that recognizes and rewards innovation and offers employees a variety of opportunities and experiences. Our employees are critical to our success and are one of the main reasons we continue to execute at a high level. We believe our continued focus on making employee engagement a top priority will help us provide high quality products and services to our customers.
 
At June 30, 2019 our employee count totaled 4,700, a decrease from 5,200 a year ago, which reflects the impact of restructuring actions taken to further optimize our manufacturing and logistics operations. The majority of our employees are employed on a full time basis and we believe we maintain good relationships with our employees. None of our employees are represented by unions or collective bargaining agreements.

Customer Service Offerings
 
We offer numerous customer service programs, each of which has been developed and introduced to consumers in an effort to make their shopping experience easier and more enjoyable.
Gift Card. This program allows customers to purchase and redeem gift cards through our website or at any participating retail design center, which can be used for any of our products or services.
 
Ethan Allen Consumer Credit. The Ethan Allen Platinum consumer credit program offers customers a menu of custom financing options. Financing offered through this program is administered by a third-party financial institution and is granted to our customers on a non-recourse basis to the Company. Customers may apply for an Ethan Allen Platinum card at any participating design center or online at ethanallen.com.
 
Marketing
 
Rooted in the five pillars of our brand – diversity of style, quality and craftsmanship, sustainability, complimentary design service, and premier in-home delivery – Ethan Allen’s marketing programs are designed to drive traffic to our retail network of approximately 300 design centers as well as to our e-commerce and social sites.
 
Our marketing approach begins with a customer experience that exemplifies the Ethan Allen difference. Through interactions in the design center, monitoring and response to online reviews and social channels, and surveys, we work to incorporate the voices of our customers into every decision we make. By deploying customer relationship management tools, we are further segmenting our target markets, creating a more personalized shopping experience and developing more personalized content than ever before.
 
Our new Ethan Allen Platinum consumer credit program, designed to make the Ethan Allen brand accessible to everyone, had a successful national launch and should continue to attract both new prospects and returning customers.
 
Through both paid and owned channels, we continue to position Ethan Allen as an aspirational yet approachable brand. We deliver these messages in a variety of ways – locally, nationally, and globally – to connect and engage with our target audience and drive sales. Direct mail continues to be a critical marketing medium for us. Our magazine, distributed to almost 22 million households, enables customers and prospects to immerse themselves in inspirational photos of our products; it is also a frequent starting point for conversations with our designers. We strive to be present at natural connection points with customers, using targeted direct mail pieces like our new mover's brochure. Along with our magazine, each direct mail piece is distributed to a targeted marketing segment based on data collected internally and through independent market research.
 
In addition to newspapers and shelter magazines, local efforts complement and strengthen our national marketing strategy with many markets increasing their reach through targeted broadcast, streaming radio, local digital and robust social initiatives.
 
As online shopping takes on increasing importance, we have continued to improve both user experience and conversion optimization on ethanallen.com and ethanallen.ca. We invest in both paid and organic search engine marketing, and we work to improve the local search rankings of each design center location. We have also continued to improve our programs for collecting user-generated content, both from customers and designers, which showcases the way our customers are living with Ethan Allen. Our new EA InHomeTM mobile app, which utilizes augmented reality, gives customers the ability to preview products in their space before they make a purchase; our 3-D room planner, available in design centers, offers an even more immersive experience and helps move customers toward conversion.
 
Significant growth in our organic social following, including a 25% increase in Instagram followers during the 2018 calendar year, and paid social campaigns help bring awareness of the Ethan Allen brand to every demographic. We utilize these channels to build a sense of community, and by extension brand loyalty, among our current and prospective customers.
 
Competition
 
We believe the home furnishings industry competes primarily on the basis of product styling and quality, personal service, prompt delivery, product availability and price. We further believe that we effectively compete on the basis of each of these factors and that, more specifically under our vertical structure, our complimentary interior design service, direct manufacturing, white glove delivery service, product presentations, and website create a competitive advantage, further supporting our mission of providing consumers with a complete home decorating and design solution. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves further with the quality of our interior design service through our intensive training and the caliber of our design consultants. Our objective is to continue to develop and strengthen our retail network by (i) expanding the Company operated retail business through the repositioning and opening of new design centers, (ii) obtaining and retaining independent retailers, encouraging such retailers to expand their business through the opening or relocation of new design centers with the objective of increasing the volume of their sales, (iii) further expanding our sales network through our independent design associates and realtor referral programs, and (iv) further expanding our ecommerce.

At Ethan Allen, our internet strategy is to drive traffic into our design centers by combining technology with excellent personal service. Though our customers have the opportunity to buy our products online, we take the process further. With so much of our product customizable, we encourage our website customers to get personal help from our interior design professionals either in person or by chatting online with one of our qualified design consultants. This complimentary direct contact with one of our knowledgeable interior designers creates a competitive advantage through our excellent personal service. This enhances the online experience and regularly leads to internet customers becoming customers of our network of interior design centers.
Retail Design Centers
 
We continue to strengthen the Ethen Allen brand with many initiatives, including the opening of new design centers and relocating or consolidating certain existing design and service centers, regularly updating presentations and floor plans, and strengthening of the qualifications of our designers through training and certification.
 
Ethan Allen design centers are typically located in busy retail settings as freestanding destinations or as part of town centers, lifestyle centers, suburban strip malls or shopping malls, depending upon the real estate opportunities in a particular market. Our 144 Company operated retail design centers average approximately 15,300 square feet in size with 63% of them ranging between 10,000 and 20,000 square feet, while 21% being less than 10,000 square feet and the remaining 16% being greater than 20,000 square feet. During the past 10 years, 37% of our design centers are new or have been relocated.
 
Combining technology with personal service in our design centers has allowed us to reduce the size of our design centers. In the past five years, we have either opened or relocated a total of 24 new design centers that have an average size of approximately 9,000 square feet. These smaller footprint design centers reflect our direction as we move forward in repositioning our retail design centers. These new and relocated design centers also reflect our shift from destination and shopping mall locations to lifestyle centers that better project our brand and offer increased traffic opportunities.
 
We strive to maintain consistency of presentation throughout our retail design centers through a comprehensive set of standards and display planning assistance. These interior display design standards enable each design center to present a high quality image by using focused lifestyle settings and select product category groupings to display our products and information to facilitate design solutions and to educate consumers. We also create a consistent brand projection through our exterior facades and signage.
 
Distribution and Logistics
 
We distribute our products through four distribution centers, owned by the Company, strategically located in North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Virginia. These distribution centers provide efficient cross-dock operations to receive and ship product from our manufacturing facilities and third-party suppliers to our retail network of Company and independently operated retail service centers. Retail service centers prepare products for delivery into customers’ homes. At June 30, 2019, our Company operated retail design centers were supported by 13 Company operated retail service centers and 14 service centers operated by third parties.
 
While we manufacture to custom order the majority of our products, we also stock certain case goods, upholstery and home accents to provide for quick delivery of in-stock items and to allow for more efficient production runs. We utilize independent carriers to ship our products.
 
Our practice has been to sell our products at the same delivered cost to all Company and independently operated design centers throughout the United States, regardless of their shipping point. This policy creates pricing credibility with our wholesale customers while providing our retail segment the opportunity to achieve more consistent margins by removing fluctuations attributable to the cost of shipping. Further, this policy eliminates the need for our independent retailers to carry significant amounts of inventory in their own warehouses. As a result, we obtain more accurate consumer product demand information.

Environmental Sustainability and Social Responsibility 
 
We continue to be focused on environmental and social responsibility while incorporating uniform social, environmental, health and safety programs into our global manufacturing standards.
 
Our environmental (green) initiatives include but are not limited to the use of responsibly harvested Appalachian woods, and water-based finishes and measuring our carbon footprint, greenhouse gases and recycled materials from our operations. We have eliminated the use of heavy metals and hydrochlorofluorocarbons in all packaging. Our mattresses and custom upholstery use foam made without harmful chemicals and substances. We have implemented the Enhancing Furniture’s Environmental Culture (“EFEC”) environmental management system sponsored by the American Home Furnishing Alliance (“AHFA”) at all our domestic manufacturing, distribution and service center facilities, and have expanded these efforts to our retail design centers, which have now been registered in EFEC. Our Mexico and Honduras facilities are also registered under the AHFA's EFEC program. Our United States manufacturing, distribution and service centers have also achieved Sustainable by Design (“SBD”) registration status under the EFEC program. SBD provides a framework for home furnishings companies to create and maintain a corporate culture of conservation and environmental stewardship by integrating socio-economic policies and sustainable business practices into their manufacturing operations and sourcing strategies.
 
The Company requires its sourcing facilities that manufacture Ethan Allen branded products to implement a labor compliance program and meet or exceed the standards established for preventing child labor, involuntary labor, coercion and harassment, discrimination, and restrictions to freedom of association. These facilities are also required to provide a safe and healthy environment in all workspaces, compliance with all local wage and hour laws and regulations, compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and are required to authorize Ethan Allen or its designated agents (including third-party auditing companies) to engage in monitoring activities to confirm compliance.
 
We work to ensure our products are safe in our customers’ homes through responsible use of chemicals and manufacturing substances.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks, service marks and copyrights for the Ethan Allen name, logos and designs in a broad range of classes for both products and services in the United States and in many foreign countries. In addition, we have registered, or have applications pending for certain of our slogans utilized in connection with promoting brand awareness, retail sales and other services and certain collection names. We view such trademarks and service marks as valuable assets and have an ongoing program to diligently monitor and defend, through appropriate action, against their unauthorized use.
Government Regulation
 
The Company is subject to reporting requirements, disclosure obligations and other recordkeeping requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the various local authorities that regulate each location in which we operate.
