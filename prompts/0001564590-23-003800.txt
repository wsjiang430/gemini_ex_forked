OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global development and commercialization of cytisinicline for smoking cessation and nicotine addiction. With more than one billion smokers globally and over 30 million smokers in the United States alone, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death, responsible for more than eight million deaths annually worldwide. Our primary focus is to address this global epidemic.
 We also plan to continue expanding our focus to address other methods of nicotine addiction such as e-cigarettes/vaping. The use of e-cigarettes continues to be widespread, with most recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating nearly 11 million adult users in the United States alone in 2019.  While e-cigarettes have been historically viewed as less harmful than combustible cigarettes, their long-term safety remains controversial. In a recent study that we conducted surveying approximately 500 users of nicotine vaping devices or e-cigarettes, approximately 73% of participants responded that they intend to quit vaping within 
 4


the next three to 12 months. Of those who intended to quit even sooner, within the next 3 months, more than half stated they would be extremely likely to try a new prescription product to help them do so. We believe that cytisinicline, if approved, could be the first prescription drug indicated for vape and e-cigarette users who are ready to quit their nicotine addiction.
 Our management team has significant experience in growing emerging companies focused on the development of under-utilized pharmaceutical compounds to meet unmet medical needs. We intend to use this experience to develop and ultimately commercialize cytisinicline either directly or via strategic collaborations.
 Cytisinicline is an established smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by Sopharma AD, or Sopharma, for over 20 years. We are evaluating an improved dosing and administration of cytisinicline that is expected to improve compliance and outcomes for smokers. We have an exclusive license and supply agreement with Sopharma for the development and commercialization of cytisinicline outside of Sopharma’s territories which are predominately located in Central and Eastern Europe. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used Sopharma’s cytisinicline product to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,700 smokers in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. 
 Cytisinicline is a naturally occurring, plant-based alkaloid. Cytisinicline is structurally similar to nicotine and has a well-defined, dual-acting mechanism of action that is both agonistic and antagonistic. It is believed to aid in smoking cessation and the treatment of nicotine addiction by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain by reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms through agonistic effects on nicotine receptors and by reducing the reward and satisfaction associated with nicotine through antagonistic properties.  
In 2018, the U.S. Adopted Names Council adopted cytisinicline as the non-proprietary, or generic, name for the substance also known as cytisine.
 Cytisinicline Ongoing and Recent Clinical Developments
 Company-Sponsored Clinical Trials for Smoking Cessation Indication
 Completed Phase 3 ORCA-2 Trial
 In April 2022, we announced positive topline results for the Phase 3 ORCA-2 clinical trial. ORCA-2 was initiated in October 2020 and evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 mg cytisinicline dosed three times daily compared to placebo in 810 adult smokers at 17 clinical sites in the United States. ORCA-2 participants were randomized to one of three study arms to determine the smoking cessation efficacy and safety profile of cytisinicline when administered for either 6 or 12 weeks, compared to placebo. All subjects received standard behavioral support and were assigned to one of the following groups:

• | Arm A: 12 weeks of placebo
--+---------------------------


• | Arm B: 6 weeks of cytisinicline, followed by 6 weeks of placebo
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Arm C: 12 weeks of cytisinicline
--+---------------------------------

 The ORCA-2 study had two independent primary endpoints that evaluated the success of smoking abstinence for both 6-week and 12-week durations of cytisinicline treatment, compared to placebo. The primary endpoints for ORCA-2 were biochemically verified continuous abstinence measured during the last four weeks of each treatment duration. Both the 6- and 12-week cytisinicline treatments demonstrated significantly better quit rates than placebo at the end of treatment with odds ratios of 8.0 and 6.3, respectively (both p values < 0.0001). An odds ratio, or OR, is a statistic that quantifies the strength of the association between two events, for example, cytisinicline treatment and smoking abstinence. Therefore, in this study, the OR represents the odds that smoking abstinence (or quitting) will occur if cytisinicline treatment is given, compared to the odds of quitting smoking if placebo is given (i.e., without cytisinicline treatment). Thus, the overall results indicated that smokers receiving 3 mg cytisinicline TID were six to eight times more likely to stop smoking compared to smokers receiving placebo.

Ongoing Phase 3 ORCA-3 Trial
 In January 2022, we initiated our Phase 3 ORCA-3 clinical trial. ORCA-3 is a confirmatory Phase 3 trial required for registrational approval of cytisinicline in the United States and has the same design as the Phase 3 ORCA-2 trial. The Phase 3 trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 mg cytisinicline dosed three times daily compared to placebo in 792 adult smokers at 20 clinical sites. ORCA-3 participants were randomized to one of three study arms to evaluate cytisinicline administered for either 6 or 12 weeks, compared to placebo. All subjects will receive standard behavioral support and will be assigned to one of the following groups:

• | Arm A: 12 weeks of placebo
--+---------------------------


• | Arm B: 6 weeks of cytisinicline, followed by 6 weeks of placebo
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Arm C: 12 weeks of cytisinicline
--+---------------------------------

 The primary outcome measure of success in the ORCA-3 trial is biochemically verified continuous abstinence during the last four weeks of treatment in the 6 and 12-week cytisinicline treatment arms compared with placebo.  Each treatment arm will be compared independently to the placebo arm, and the trial will be determined to be successful if either or both of the cytisinicline treatment arms show a statistical benefit compared to placebo. Secondary outcome measures will be conducted to assess continued abstinence rates through six months from the start of study treatment. Last subject dosing occurred in January of 2023, and we expect topline ORCA-3 data results to be reported in the second quarter of 2023.
 Completed Company-Sponsored Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 In June 2019, we announced positive top line results for the Phase 2b ORCA-1 trial and defined the dose selection of 3 mg, three times daily, or TID, for our Phase 3 development. ORCA-1 was the first trial in our Ongoing Research of Cytisinicline for Addiction Program, or ORCA Program, that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of cytisinicline for smoking cessation, nicotine addiction therapy, and potential benefit in other indications.
 ORCA-1 was initiated in October 2018 and evaluated 254 smokers in the United States. The trial evaluated both 1.5 mg and 3 mg doses of cytisinicline on the standard declining titration schedule as well as a more simplified TID dosing schedule, both over 25 days. The trial was randomized and blinded to compare the effectiveness of the cytisinicline doses and schedules to respective placebo groups. Subjects were treated for 25 days, provided behavioral support, and followed up for an additional four weeks to assess continued smoking abstinence after the 25-day treatment. 
 The primary endpoint in the study was the reduction in daily smoking, a self-reported measure. Three of the four cytisinicline treatment arms demonstrated a statistically significant reduction, p<0.05, compared to placebo. The fourth arm trended to significance (p= 0.052). Across all treatment arms, over the 25-day treatment period, subjects on cytisinicline experienced a 74-80% median reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, compared to a 62% reduction in the placebo arms. 
 The secondary endpoint of the trial was a 4-week continuous abstinence rate, which is the relevant endpoint for regulatory approval. All cytisinicline treatment arms showed significant improvements in abstinence rates compared to the placebo arms. Notably, the 3 mg TID cytisinicline arm demonstrated a 50% abstinence rate at week 4, compared to 10% for placebo (p<0.0001) and a continuous abstinence rate, weeks 5 through 8, of 30% for cytisinicline compared to 8% for placebo (p= 0.005). Smokers in the 3 mg TID arm had an OR of 5.04 (95% CI: 1.42, 22.32) for continuous abstinence from week 5 to week 8, compared with placebo. In this study, the results indicated that smokers receiving 3 mg cytisinicline TID were five times more likely to stop smoking compared to smokers receiving placebo.
 At week 4, all four cytisinicline arms demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.05) reductions in expired carbon monoxide, or CO, a biochemical measure of smoking activity. Expired CO levels had declined by a median of 71-80% in the cytisinicline treatment arms, compared to only 38% in the placebo arms. The greater reductions in expired CO levels for the cytisinicline arms versus placebo suggest that placebo-treated subjects may have over-reported their reduction in cigarettes smoked or overcompensated with greater inhalation while smoking fewer cigarettes. 
 Cytisinicline was well-tolerated with no serious adverse effects, or SAEs, reported. The most commonly reported (>5%) adverse effects, or AEs, across all cytisinicline treatment arms versus placebo arms were abnormal dreams, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infections, and nausea. In the 3 mg TID treatment arm versus placebo arms, the most common AEs were abnormal dreams, insomnia, and constipation (each 6% vs 2%), upper respiratory tract infections (6% vs 14%), and nausea (6% vs 10%), respectively. Compliance with study treatment was greater than 94% across all arms. 
 We presented the ORCA-1 results in September 2019 at the annual European meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, or SRNT, held in Oslo, Norway and the trial results were published in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research in April 
 6


2021. Based on the results of the ORCA-1 trial, we have selected 3 mg TID for Phase 3 development. Overall, the 3 mg dose administered TID demonstrated the best overall safety and efficacy when compared to the 1.5 mg dose or the declining titration schedule evaluated in ORCA-1. At the SRNT European meeting held in September 2021, exploratory analyses were presented that showed cytisinicline treatment had an earlier onset of sustained abstinence compared to placebo and that the cytisinicline TID schedule appeared more effective for achieving sustained abstinence in smokers who had previously failed to quit on varenicline compared to the declining titration schedule. 
 
In November 2019, we held a type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to review the ORCA-1 results and our revisions to the Phase 3 clinical program using the simplified 3 mg TID dosing schedule. The FDA agreed that the 3 mg TID dosing schedule was acceptable. 
 Other Clinical Trials
 
We are conducting two clinical studies required for the NDA: one pharmacokinetics, or PK, study to evaluate for any increased cytisinicline blood levels in subjects who have various levels of renal impairment, and another study to evaluate for any effects of cytisinicline on QT interval prolongation. Plans for both studies, were first discussed with the FDA as part of an end of Phase 2 meeting in 2018, followed by more detailed review and agreement with the FDA during 2022. In addition, we are conducting a final PK study to determine various remaining PK parameters for the 3 mg TID cytisinicline regimen, including the timing of steady state dosing. Results from these studies are anticipated to be available in 2023.
 
Company-Sponsored Clinical Trials for an E-cigarette (nicotine vaping) Cessation Indication
 Ongoing Phase 2 ORCA-V1 Clinical Trial
 In July 2021, we announced that we were awarded a grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to evaluate the use of cytisinicline as a treatment for cessation of nicotine e-cigarette use. This initial grant award, in the amount of $320,000, disbursed on August 1, 2021, and was utilized to complete critical regulatory and clinical operational activities, such as protocol finalization, clinical trial site identification, and submission of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, to the FDA for investigating cytisinicline in nicotine e-cigarette users. In November 2021, we announced that the FDA had completed their review and accepted the IND application to investigate cytisinicline as a cessation treatment in this population. 
 
In June 2022, following NIDA/NIH review of completed milestones, we announced that we were awarded the next grant funding from NIDA in the amount of approximately $2.5 million and that we initiated the ORCA-V1 Phase 2 Clinical trial. 
 
ORCA-V1 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 mg cytisinicline dosed three times daily compared to placebo in 160 adult e-cigarette users at five clinical trial locations in the United States. Participants were randomized to receive cytisinicline or placebo for 12 weeks in combination with standard cessation behavioral support. We announced in February 2023 that the last subject dosed had occurred and that we expect topline ORCA-V1 data results to be reported in the second quarter of 2023.
 
The full grant award of $2.8 million is expected to cover approximately half of the total ORCA-V1 clinical study costs. The Primary Investigators for the grant are our President and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Cindy Jacobs, and Dr. Nancy Rigotti, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director, Tobacco Research and Treatment Center, Massachusetts General Hospital.
 
Other Recent Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trials
 
In June 2020, we announced the topline results from the independent, investigator-sponsored Phase 3 RAUORA trial. RAUORA was a non-inferiority study comparing cytisinicline to Chantix (varenicline) in Māori (indigenous New Zealanders) and whānau (family) of Māori. The study was led by Dr. Natalie Walker, Associate Professor at the University of Auckland, and was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. The study enrollment was planned for 2,140 subjects. In total, 1,105 Māori or whānau expressed interest in participating in the study and a total of 679 were randomized to receive either cytisinicline or varenicline. The average age of participants in the trial was 43 years and approximately 70% of the participants were women. 
 
The study compared cytisinicline administered on a schedule of 25 days of declining titration followed by twice-daily dosing for a total of 12 weeks with varenicline administered on a schedule of seven days of inclining titration followed by twice-daily dosing for a total of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was a comparison of biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence rates at six months, and the trial was designed to assess if the two agents were non-inferior to each other.

The primary endpoint of the non-inferiority trial was to demonstrate that cytisinicline quit rates would be no less than 10% lower than the quit rates for varenicline. Topline results indicated that the RAUORA trial achieved its primary endpoint in showing that cytisinicline plus behavioral support was at least as effective as varenicline plus behavioral support at 6 months. Cytisinicline met the pre-specified non-inferiority endpoint and was trending towards superiority with an Absolute Risk Difference of +4.29 in favor of cytisinicline (95% CI -0.22 to 8.79), demonstrating a 4.29% improvement in quit rates in favor of cytisinicline. Specifically, continuous abstinence rates at 6 months, verified by expired CO, were 12.1% for cytisinicline compared to 7.9% for varenicline. The Relative Risk was 1.55 on an intent-to-treat basis, indicating that subjects in the cytisinicline arm were approximately one and a half times more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months compared to subjects who received varenicline.
 
Additionally, significantly fewer overall AEs were reported in cytisinicline-treated subjects (Relative Risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.65, p<0.001). Notably, of the subjects who experienced adverse events, cytisinicline subjects reported significantly less nausea, insomnia and vivid dreams (p<0.05).
 
The final RAUORA trial results and additional analyses were presented at the SRNT European Annual Meeting in September 2020 and were published in the journal Addiction in March 2021. Also presented at the SRNT Europe Annual Meeting in September 2020 were results from a preclinical study conducted at the University of Cambridge Department of Biochemistry. The study was designed to examine the in vitro binding characteristics of cytisinicline compared to varenicline at the human 5-HT3 receptor. Using a radioligand antagonist displacement design, the study reported an IC50 of 0.50 mM for cytisinicline and 0.25 µM for varenicline, representing a 2000-greater fold agonist binding affinity to the 5-HT3 receptor for varenicline compared to cytisinicline. Agonist activation of 5-HT3 receptors in the brain stem has been shown to induce nausea and vomiting. The data demonstrating the difference in binding potency at the 5-HT3 receptor provide potential rationale for the lower overall incidence of adverse events reported for cytisinicline compared to varenicline.
 Non-clinical 
 Non-clinical toxicology studies were sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or NCCIH, a division of the NIH and by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, to assist in our IND for investigating cytisinicline as a smoking cessation treatment. We filed this IND application for cytisinicline with the FDA in 2017, which included the NCCIH sponsored non-clinical studies. Additional NCCIH and NCI sponsored non-clinical toxicology studies were later submitted in support for initiating our Phase 3 program.
 Non-clinical toxicology studies that are required for a New Drug Application, or NDA, include two longer-term chronic toxicology studies and two carcinogenicity studies, which were completed as company-sponsored studies and submitted to the FDA.  
 
OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE - CYTISINICLINE
 Overview of Cytisinicline
 Our product candidate, cytisinicline, is a naturally occurring, plant-based alkaloid. Cytisinicline is structurally similar to nicotine and has a well-defined, dual-acting mechanism of action that is both agonistic and antagonistic. It is believed to aid in smoking cessation and the treatment of nicotine addiction by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain by reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms through agonistic effects on nicotine receptors and by reducing the reward and satisfaction associated with nicotine through antagonistic properties. 
 Cytisinicline is an established smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by Sopharma for over 20 years. We are evaluating an improved dosing and administration of cytisinicline that is expected to improve compliance and outcomes for smokers. We have an exclusive license and supply agreement with Sopharma for the development and commercialization of cytisinicline outside of Sopharma’s territories which are predominately located in Central and Eastern Europe. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used Sopharma’s cytisinicline product to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,700 smokers in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand.
 Cytisinicline Mechanism of Action
 Cytisinicline is a partial agonist that binds with high affinity to the alpha-4 beta-2, or α4β2, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Through dual-acting partial agonist/partial antagonist activity, cytisinicline is believed to help reduce nicotine cravings, withdrawal symptoms and reward and satisfaction associated with smoking. The α4β2 nicotinic receptor is a well-understood target in addiction. When nicotine binds to this receptor, it causes dopamine to be released in the mid-brain, reinforcing the dopamine reward system. This receptor has been implicated in the development and maintenance of nicotine addiction. Cytisinicline is believed to act as a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic receptor, preventing nicotine from binding and releasing dopamine.

Cytisinicline Opportunity
 
We have an exclusive license and supply agreement with Sopharma for the development and commercialization of cytisinicline outside of Sopharma’s territory, which consists of certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, as well as Vietnam. We intend to develop and commercialize cytisinicline in the United States, and thereafter to target other markets outside of Sopharma’s territory, such as Western Europe, Japan, China, Australasia, Southeast Asia and Latin and South America.
 We are developing cytisinicline as an aid to smoking cessation and treatment for nicotine addiction to address the limitations of both prescription drugs and of Over-the-Counter, or OTC, products. We believe that a substantial market exists in the United States, European Union, or EU, and the rest of the world for a safe and effective smoking cessation treatment. We believe cytisinicline can serve as a cost-effective alternative to existing treatments, with the potential for better efficacy than nicotine replacement therapies, or NRTs, and a potentially superior side effect profile than existing prescription smoking cessation products. Our goal is to obtain approval from the FDA and from other regulatory agencies for the sale and distribution of cytisinicline in the United States and subsequently to other countries outside of Sopharma’s territory.
 Cytisinicline Clinical Development
 Non-clinical toxicology studies were sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or NCCIH, a division of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, to assist in our IND. In June 2017, we filed our IND application for cytisinicline with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which included the NCCIH sponsored non-clinical studies. Additional non-clinical reproductive toxicology studies have also been conducted by NCCIH and NCI, with three such studies already submitted to the FDA. 
 Other non-clinical toxicology studies that are required for a New Drug Application, or NDA, include two longer-term chronic toxicology studies and two carcinogenicity studies, which were completed as company-sponsored studies and submitted to the FDA.  
 In August 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisinicline in normal healthy volunteers. We completed the food effect study and announced the results in November of 2017 demonstrating similar bioavailability of cytisinicline in fed and fasted subjects.
 In October 2017, we initiated a clinical study assessing the repeat-dose pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, effects of 1.5 mg and 3 mg cytisinicline in 26 healthy volunteer smokers when administered over the 25-day declining titration course of treatment as marketed by Sopharma in their territories. Final results were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, or SRNT, in February 2019. All 26 subjects completed the study. Predictable increases in plasma cytisinicline concentrations were observed with increasing unit dosing from 1.5 mg to 3 mg. Smokers in the study were not required to have a designated or predetermined quit date. Overall, subjects had an 80% reduction in cigarettes smoked, 82% reduction in expired CO, and 46% of the subjects achieved biochemically verified smoking abstinence by day 26. Subjects who received 3 mg cytisinicline over the 25 days had a trend for higher smoking abstinence compared to subjects who received 1.5 mg cytisinicline. The AEs observed were mostly mild with transient headaches as the most commonly reported event. No SAEs were observed in the study.
 In December 2017, we initiated a series of drug metabolism, drug-to-drug interaction, and transporter studies of cytisinicline and results from these studies were announced in June 2018. These studies demonstrated that cytisinicline has no clinically significant interaction with any of the hepatic enzymes commonly responsible for drug metabolism nor clinically significant interaction with drug transporters. This suggests that cytisinicline may be administered with other medications without the need to modify the dose of any co-administered medications. We will continue to evaluate any new FDA guidance on whether additional drug-to-drug interactions studies will be required prior to a future NDA filing.
 We have met with the FDA to identify the steps required for the approval of cytisinicline. We held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in May 2018 to review and receive guidance on our Phase 3 clinical program and overall development plans for cytisinicline to support an NDA. This review included submitted results from non-clinical studies, standard drug-to-drug interaction and reproductive/teratogenicity studies. Detailed plans for chronic toxicology, carcinogenicity studies, and additional clinical studies regarding renal impairment, QT interval prolongation, longer term exposure and adequate demonstration of safety and efficacy from our planned randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials were also discussed.

In 2018, Sopharma commercially launched a newly formulated cytisinicline tablet with improved shelf life in their territories. In May 2018, we initiated a study to evaluate the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisinicline in volunteer smokers using this new formulation and data results were announced in September 2018. The study demonstrated similar bioavailability of cytisinicline in fed and fasted subjects. Cytisinicline was extensively absorbed after oral administration with maximum cytisinicline concentration levels observed in the blood within less than two hours with or without food. Total excretion levels of cytisinicline also remained equivalent in both the fed and fasted states, and the 3 mg dose using this new formulation of cytisinicline was well tolerated.
 In the third quarter of 2018, the United States Adopted Names Council adopted cytisinicline as the non-proprietary, or generic, name for the substance also known as cytisine.
 In December 2018, we announced that the FDA agreed with our Initial Pediatric Study Plan, specifically, providing a full waiver for evaluating cytisinicline in a pediatric population. The reasons for the full waiver were based on the low numbers of children smoking under the age of 12 and the logistical difficulties of recruiting treatment-seeking smokers in the adolescent age group. The agreed upon Initial Pediatric Study Plan is expected to be included as part of our future application for marketing approval of cytisinicline.
 In March 2019, we initiated a clinical trial to assess the dose limiting AEs that would define the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, for a single administered oral dose of cytisinicline. This study evaluated smokers who received one single dose of cytisinicline. The starting dosage of cytisinicline was 6 mg and was to be increased in separate groups of subjects for each escalated dose level until stopping criteria (based on the occurrence of dose-limiting AEs) were reached. A safety review after each dose level was performed by an independent Data Safety Monitor Committee, or DSMC, before escalation to the next dose level. Six dose levels were pre-planned with 21 mg cytisinicline as the highest dose level. When the MTD was not reached at 21 mg, the study was amended to evaluate doses up to 30 mg, as recommended by the DSMC. At this 30 mg dose, the stopping criteria of serious or severe AEs were still not met, but the DSMC recommended stopping the study since the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms were approaching an MTD level. The results were reviewed with the FDA, with an agreement that further escalation beyond the single 30 mg dose was not required. This Phase-1 study was a requirement for our future NDA and marketing approval of cytisinicline. It fulfills an FDA requirement to evaluate potential safety issues in the event patients exceed a recommended single dose outside of a clinical trial setting.
 In June 2019, we announced positive top line results for the Phase 2b ORCA-1 trial and defined the dose selection of 3 mg, three times daily, or TID, for our Phase 3 development. ORCA-1 was the first trial in our ORCA Program that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of cytisinicline for smoking cessation, nicotine addiction, and potential benefit in other indications.
 ORCA-1 was initiated in October 2018 and evaluated 254 smokers in the United States. The trial evaluated both 1.5 mg and 3 mg doses of cytisinicline on the standard declining titration schedule as well as a more simplified TID dosing schedule, both over 25 days. The trial was randomized and blinded to compare the effectiveness of the cytisinicline doses and schedules to respective placebo groups. Subjects were treated for 25 days, provided behavioral support, and followed up for an additional four weeks to assess continued smoking abstinence after the 25-day treatment. 
 The primary endpoint in the study was the reduction in daily smoking, a self-reported measure. Three of the four cytisinicline treatment arms demonstrated a statistically significant reduction, p<0.05, compared to placebo. The fourth arm trended to significance (p= 0.052). Across all treatment arms, over the 25-day treatment period, subjects on cytisinicline experienced a 74-80% median reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, compared to a 62% reduction in the placebo arms. 
 The secondary endpoint of the trial was a 4-week continuous abstinence rate, which is the relevant endpoint for regulatory approval. All cytisinicline treatment arms showed significant improvements in abstinence rates compared to the placebo arms. Notably, the 3 mg TID cytisinicline arm demonstrated a 54% abstinence rate starting at week 4, compared to 16% for placebo (p<0.0001) and a continuous abstinence rate, weeks 5 through 8, of 30% for cytisinicline compared to 8% for placebo (p= 0.005). Participants in the 3 mg TID arm had an OR of 5.04 (95% CI: 1.42, 22.32) for continuous abstinence from week 5 to week 8, compared with placebo indicating that smokers receiving 3 mg cytisinicline TID were five times more likely to stop smoking compared to smokers receiving placebo.
 At week 4, all four cytisinicline arms demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.05) reductions in expired CO a biochemical measure of smoking activity. Expired CO levels had declined by a median of 71-80% in the cytisinicline treatment arms, compared to only 38% in the placebo arms. The greater reductions in expired CO levels for the cytisinicline arms versus placebo suggest that placebo-treated subjects may have over-reported their reduction in cigarettes smoked or overcompensated with greater inhalation while smoking fewer cigarettes.

Cytisinicline was well-tolerated with no SAEs reported. The most commonly reported (>5%) AEs across all cytisinicline treatment arms versus placebo arms were abnormal dreams, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infections, and nausea. In the 3 mg TID treatment arm versus placebo arms, the most common AEs were abnormal dreams, insomnia, and constipation (each 6% vs 2%), upper respiratory tract infections (6% vs 14%), and nausea (6% vs 10%), respectively. Compliance with study treatment was greater than 94% across all arms.
We presented the ORCA-1 results in September 2019 at the annual European meeting of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco, or SRNT, held in Oslo, Norway. Based on the results of the ORCA-1 trial, we have selected 3 mg TID for Phase 3 development. Overall, the 3 mg dose administered TID demonstrated the best overall safety and efficacy when compared to other doses and administrations studied in ORCA-1. 
 
In November 2019, we held a type C meeting with the FDA to review the ORCA-1 results and our revisions to the Phase 3 clinical program using the simplified 3 mg TID dosing schedule. The FDA agreed that the 3 mg TID dosing schedule was acceptable. We also discussed with the FDA timing for the submission of the 13-week interim report from the second ongoing chronic toxicology study to support the longer treatment durations of 6- and 12-weeks in the Phase 3 clinical program. This interim chronic toxicology report was submitted in the second quarter of 2020 to the FDA.
 
In June 2020, we announced topline results from the independent, investigator-sponsored Phase 3 RAUORA trial. RAUORA was a non-inferiority study comparing cytisinicline to Chantix (varenicline) in Māori (indigenous New Zealanders) and whānau (family) of Māori. The study was led by Dr. Natalie Walker, Associate Professor at the University of Auckland, and was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. In total, 1,105 Māori or whānau expressed interest in participating in the study and a total of 679 were randomized to receive either cytisinicline or varenicline. The average age of participants in the trial was 43 years and approximately 70% of the participants were women. 
 
The study compared cytisinicline administered on a schedule of 25 days of declining titration followed by twice-daily dosing for a total of 12 weeks with varenicline administered on a schedule of seven days of inclining titration followed by twice-daily dosing for a total of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was a comparison of biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence rates at 6 months, and the trial was designed to assess if the two agents were non-inferior to each other.  
 
Topline results indicated that the RAUORA trial achieved statistical significance in showing that cytisinicline plus behavioral support was at least as effective as varenicline plus behavioral support at 6 months. In addition, the trial showed that cytisinicline resulted in significantly fewer reported nausea adverse events as well as significantly fewer overall adverse events when compared to varenicline (p<0.001). 
 
The final RAUORA trial results and additional analyses were presented at the SRNT European Annual Meeting in September 2020 and were published in the Journal Addiction in 2021. The primary endpoint of the non-inferiority trial was to demonstrate that cytisinicline quit rates would be no less than 10% lower than the quit rates for varenicline. Results showed that cytisinicline met the pre-specified non-inferiority endpoint and was trending towards superiority with an Absolute Risk Difference of +4.29 in favor of cytisinicline (95% CI -0.22 to 8.79), demonstrating a 4.29% improvement in quit rates in favor of cytisinicline. Specifically, continuous abstinence rates at 6 months, verified by exhaled CO, were 12.1% for cytisinicline compared to 7.9% for varenicline. The Relative Risk was 1.55 on an intent-to-treat basis, indicating that subjects in the cytisinicline arm were approximately one and a half times more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months compared to subjects who received varenicline.
 
Additionally, significantly fewer overall AEs were reported in cytisinicline-treated subjects (Relative Risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.65, p<0.001), indicating that subjects on cytisinicline were roughly half as likely to experience AEs compared to subjects on varenicline. Notably, of the subjects who experienced adverse events (111 in the cytisinicline arm compared to 138 in the varenicline arm), there was significantly less nausea and vivid dreams on cytisinicline treatment when compared to varenicline treatment.
 
Also presented at the SRNT Europe Annual Meeting in September 2020 were results from a preclinical study conducted at the University of Cambridge Department of Biochemistry. The study was designed to examine the in vitro binding characteristics of cytisinicline compared to varenicline at the human 5-HT3 receptor. Using a radioligand antagonist displacement design, the study reported an IC50 of 0.50 mM for cytisinicline and 0.25 µM for varenicline, representing a 2000-greater fold agonist binding affinity to the 5-HT3 receptor for varenicline compared to cytisinicline. Agonist activation of 5-HT3 receptors in the brain stem has been shown to induce nausea and vomiting. The data demonstrating the difference in binding potency at the 5-HT3 receptor provide potential rationale for the lower overall incidence of adverse events reported for cytisinicline compared to varenicline.

In October 2020, we initiated our Phase 3 ORCA-2 clinical trial and in April 2022 announced positive topline results. ORCA-2  evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 mg cytisinicline dosed three times daily compared to placebo in 810 adult smokers at 17 clinical sites in the United States. ORCA-2 participants were randomized to one of three study arms to determine the smoking cessation efficacy and safety profile of cytisinicline when administered for either 6 or 12 weeks, compared to placebo. All subjects received standard behavioral support and were assigned to one of the following groups:
  
• | Arm A: 12 weeks of placebo
--+---------------------------


• | Arm B: 6 weeks of cytisinicline, followed by 6 weeks of placebo
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Arm C: 12 weeks of cytisinicline
--+---------------------------------

 The ORCA-2 study had two independent primary endpoints that evaluated the success of smoking abstinence for both 6-week and 12-week durations of cytisinicline treatment, compared to placebo. The primary endpoints for ORCA-2 were biochemically verified continuous abstinence measured during the last 4 weeks of each treatment duration. Both the 6- and 12-week cytisinicline treatments demonstrated significantly better quit rates than placebo with ORs of 8.0 and 6.3, respectively. 
 In January 2022, we initiated our Phase 3 ORCA-3 clinical trial. ORCA-3 is a confirmatory Phase 3 trial required for registrational approval of cytisinicline in the United States and has the same design as the Phase 3 ORCA-2 trial. The Phase 3 trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 mg cytisinicline dosed three times daily compared to placebo in 792 adult smokers at 19 clinical sites. ORCA-3 participants were randomized to one of three study arms to evaluate cytisinicline administered for either 6 or 12 weeks, compared to placebo. All subjects will receive standard behavioral support and will be assigned to one of the following groups:
  
• | Arm A: 12 weeks of placebo
--+---------------------------


• | Arm B: 6 weeks of cytisinicline, followed by 6 weeks of placebo
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Arm C: 12 weeks of cytisinicline
--+---------------------------------

 The primary outcome measure of success in the ORCA-3 trial is biochemically verified continuous abstinence during the last four weeks of treatment in the 6 and 12-week cytisinicline treatment arms compared with placebo.  Each treatment arm will be compared independently to the placebo arm, and the trial will be determined to be successful if either or both of the cytisinicline treatment arms show a statistical benefit compared to placebo. Secondary outcome measures will be conducted to assess continued abstinence rates through six months from the start of study treatment. We expect topline ORCA-3 data results to be reported in the second quarter of 2023.
 In July 2021, we announced that we were awarded a grant from NIDA, to evaluate the use of cytisinicline as a treatment for cessation of nicotine e-cigarette use. This initial grant award, in the amount of $320,000, commenced on August 1, 2021, and was utilized to complete critical regulatory and clinical operational activities, such as protocol finalization, clinical trial site identification, and submission of an IND application to the FDA for investigating cytisinicline in nicotine e-cigarette users. In November 2021, we announced that the FDA had completed their review and accepted the IND application to investigate cytisinicline as a cessation treatment in this population. 
 
In June 2022, following NIDA/NIH review of completed milestones, we announced that we were awarded the next grant funding from NIDA in the amount of approximately $2.5 million to conduct the ORCA-V1 Phase 2 Clinical trial.
 
Following the funding grant, we announced the initiation of the ORCA-V1 Phase 2 Clinical trial in the same month. 
 
ORCA-V1 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3 mg cytisinicline dosed three times daily compared to placebo in 160 adult e-cigarette users at five clinical trial locations in the United States. Participants were randomized to receive cytisinicline or placebo for 12 weeks in combination with standard cessation behavioral support. We expect topline ORCA-V1 data results to be reported in the second quarter of 2023.
 
The full grant award of $2.8 million is expected to cover approximately half of the total ORCA-V1 clinical study costs. The Primary Investigators for the grant are our President and Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Cindy Jacobs, and Dr. Nancy Rigotti, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Director, Tobacco Research and Treatment Center, Massachusetts General Hospital.
Completed Cytisinicline Clinical Trials
 Cytisinicline has been previously tested in more than 2,700 participants during three large, randomized, independent investigator-sponsored Phase 3 clinical trials using Sopharma’s product. These trials were conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements. The objective of these independent groups was to further define the efficacy and safety of cytisinicline according to 
 12


GCP standards. Subsequently, we ran the Phase 2b ORCA-1 dose selection trial in 254 smokers in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alternative cytisinicline dosing and schedules compared to respective placebo groups.
 Company-Sponsored Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 Phase 3 ORCA-2 Trial
 In April 2022, we announced positive topline results for the Phase 3 ORCA-2 clinical trial. ORCA-2 was initiated in October 2020 and evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 mg cytisinicline dosed three times daily compared to placebo in 810 adult smokers at 17 clinical sites in the United States. ORCA-2 participants were randomized to one of three study arms to determine the smoking cessation efficacy and safety profile of cytisinicline when administered for either 6 or 12 weeks, compared to placebo. All subjects received standard behavioral support and were assigned to one of the following groups:

• | Arm A: 12 weeks of placebo
--+---------------------------


• | Arm B: 6 weeks of cytisinicline, followed by 6 weeks of placebo
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Arm C: 12 weeks of cytisinicline
--+---------------------------------

 The ORCA-2 study had two independent primary endpoints that evaluated the success of smoking abstinence for both 6-week and 12-week durations of cytisinicline treatment, compared to placebo. The primary endpoints for ORCA-2 were biochemically verified continuous abstinence measured during the last 4 weeks of each treatment duration. Both the 6- and 12-week cytisinicline treatments demonstrated significantly better quit rates than placebo with ORs of 8.0 and 6.3, respectively. 
  
• | Subjects who received 12 weeks of cytisinicline treatment had 6.3 times higher odds, or likelihood, to have quit smoking during the last 4 weeks of treatment compared to subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). The abstinence rate during weeks 9-12 was 32.6% for cytisinicline compared to 7.0% for placebo.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Subjects who received 6 weeks of cytisinicline treatment had 8.0 times higher odds, or likelihood, to have quit smoking during the last 4 weeks of treatment compared to subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001). The abstinence rate during weeks 3-6 was 25.3% for cytisinicline compared to 4.4% for placebo.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The secondary endpoints measured continuous abstinence after treatment out to 24 weeks. Both the 6- and 12-week secondary endpoints for continuous abstinence demonstrated significantly better quit rates for cytisinicline treated subjects than placebo. The continuous abstinence rate from week 9 to 24 was 21.1% for the 12-week cytisinicline arm compared to 4.8% for placebo, with an OR of 5.3 (p<0.0001). The continuous abstinence rate from week 3 to 24 was 8.9% for the 6-week cytisinicline arm compared to 2.6% for placebo, with an OR of 3.7 (p=0.0016).
 A third secondary endpoint compared the two cytisinicline treatment arms and evaluated for an increased risk in relapse from week 6 to week 24 when subjects were switched to placebo during week 6 to week 12 (Arm B) instead of receiving cytisinicline for another 6 weeks during week 6 to week 12 (Arm C). The analysis showed that there was no increased risk of smoking relapse in subjects who had successfully quit smoking by week 3 through week 6 if they received placebo instead of continuing cytisinicline from week 6 to week 12.
 Cytisinicline was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported. The most commonly reported adverse events (occurring greater than 5% overall in the study) for placebo, 6-week cytisinicline, and 12-week cytisinicline, respectively, were:
 
 
 | Placebo | 6-Weeks Cytisinicline | 12-Weeks Cytisinicline
Insomnia | 4.8% | 8.6% | 9.6% 
Abnormal Dreams | 3.0% | 8.2% | 7.8% 
Headaches | 8.1% | 6.7% | 7.8% 
Nausea | 7.4% | 5.9% | 5.6% 

 
Additional analyses from the ORCA-2 trial were presented at the SRNT annual meeting in March 2023. We expect to submit additional findings for presentation at future medical conferences and are in the process of publishing the ORCA-2 trial results.
 Company-Sponsored Phase 2 Clinical Trial
 Phase 2b ORCA-1 Trial
 We conducted the Phase 2b ORCA-1 dose selection trial, which was initiated in October 2018 and evaluated 254 smokers in the United States. The trial evaluated both 1.5 mg and 3 mg doses of cytisinicline on the standard declining titration schedule as well as a more simplified TID dosing schedule, both over 25 days. The trial was randomized and blinded to compare the effectiveness of the cytisinicline doses and schedules to respective placebo groups. All subjects were treated for 25 days, provided behavioral support, and followed up for an additional four weeks to assess smoking abstinence. 
 The primary endpoint in the study was the reduction in daily smoking, a self-reported measure. Three of the four cytisinicline treatment arms demonstrated a statistically significant reduction, p<0.05, compared to placebo. The fourth arm trended to significance (p= 0.052). Across all treatment arms, over the 25-day treatment period, subjects on cytisinicline experienced a 74-80% median reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, compared to a 62% reduction in the placebo arms. 
 The primary endpoint in the study was the reduction in daily smoking, a self-reported measure. Three of the four cytisinicline treatment arms demonstrated a statistically significant improvement, p<0.05, compared to placebo. The fourth arm trended to significance (p= 0.052). Across all treatment arms, over the 25-day treatment period, subjects on cytisinicline experienced a 74-80% median reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, compared to a 62% reduction in the placebo arms. 
 The secondary endpoint of the trial was a 4-week continuous abstinence rate, which is the relevant endpoint for regulatory approval. All cytisinicline treatment arms showed significant improvements in abstinence rates compared to the placebo arms. Notably, the 3 mg TID cytisinicline arm demonstrated a 50% abstinence rate at week 4, compared to 10% for placebo (p<0.0001) and a continuous abstinence rate, weeks 5 through 8, of 30% for cytisinicline compared to 8% for placebo (p= 0.005). Smokers in the 3 mg TID arm had an OR of 5.04 (95% CI: 1.42, 22.32) for continuous abstinence from week 5 to week 8, compared with placebo, meaning, smokers receiving 3 mg cytisinicline TID were five times more likely to stop smoking compared to smokers receiving placebo.
 At week 4, all four cytisinicline arms demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.05) reductions in expired carbon monoxide, or CO, a biochemical measure of smoking activity. Expired CO levels had declined by a median of 71-80% in the cytisinicline treatment arms, compared to only 38% in the placebo arms. The greater reductions in expired CO levels for the cytisinicline arms versus placebo suggest that placebo-treated subjects may have over-reported their reduction in cigarettes smoked or overcompensated with greater inhalation while smoking fewer cigarettes.

Cytisinicline was well-tolerated with no serious adverse effects, or SAEs, reported. The most commonly reported (>5%) adverse effects, or AEs, across all cytisinicline treatment arms versus placebo arms were abnormal dreams, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infections, and nausea. In the 3 mg TID treatment arm versus placebo arms, the most common AEs were abnormal dreams, insomnia, and constipation (each 6% vs 2%), upper respiratory tract infections (6% vs 14%), and nausea (6% vs 10%), respectively. Compliance with study treatment was greater than 94% across all arms. 
A summary of AEs reported in subjects in the ORCA-1 trial is included in the table below. 
 
 
 | TID | Declining Titration | Pooled 
 | 1.5 mg(n=52) | 3.0 mg(n=50) | 1.5 mg(n=51) | 3.0 mg(n=50) | Cytisinicline(n=203) | Placebo(n=51)
At least 1 AE | 20 (39%) | 21 (42%) | 29 (57%) | 23 (46%) | 93 (46%) | 24 (47%) 
URTI | 5 (10%) | 3 (6%) | 3 (6%) | 2 (4%) | 13 (6%) | 7 (14%) 
Abnormal dreams | 4 (8%) | 3 (6%) | 4 (8%) | 7 (14%) | 18 (9%) | 1 (2%) 
Nausea | 1 (2%) | 3 (6%) | 5 (10%) | 3 (6%) | 12 (6%) | 5 (10%) 
Insomnia | 4 (8%) | 3 (6%) | 3 (6%) | 4 (8%) | 14 (7%) | 1 (2%) 
Headache | 6 (12%) | 2 (4%) | 1 (2%) | 1 (2%) | 10 (5%) | 2 (4%) 
Fatigue | 3 (6%) | 1 (2%) | 1 (2%) | 2 (4%) | 7 (3%) | 2 (4%) 
Constipation | 1 (2%) | 3 (6%) | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | 4 (2%) | 1 (2%) 

 
The outcome of the ORCA-1 trial was the selection of 3 mg TID for Phase 3 development. Overall, the 3 mg dose administered TID demonstrated the best overall safety and efficacy when compared to other doses and administrations studies in ORCA-1. The results from ORCA-1 study were published in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research in 2021.

Independent Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trials
 TASC Trial
 The Tabex Smoking Cessation, or TASC, trial, was sponsored by the United Kingdom, or U.K., Centre for Tobacco Control Studies and evaluated cytisinicline versus placebo in 740 primarily moderate-to-heavy smokers treated for 25 days in a single center in Warsaw, Poland. The TASC trial was designed as a Real World Evidence trial of cytisinicline that included minimal behavioral support. The primary outcome measure was sustained, biochemically verified smoking abstinence for 12 months after the end of treatment. The TASC trial was conceived by Professor Robert West (Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London) and was funded by a grant from the National Prevention Research Initiative, including contributions from Cancer Research U.K., the U.K. Medical Research Council, U.K. Department of Health and others. We, through Sopharma, provided the study drug used in this trial.
 The results of the TASC trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011. The rate of sustained 12-month abstinence was 8.4% in the cytisinicline arm as compared with 2.4% in the placebo group (p=0.001). These results showed that the cytisinicline arm had an OR of 3.4 for sustained 12-month abstinence (the OR standard measure of association between an exposure (cytisinicline treatment) and an outcome (continuous smoking abstinence) in this study, indicated that smokers receiving cytisinicline were 3.4 times more likely to stop smoking compared to placebo for one year). The rate of sustained 6-month abstinence was 10.0% in the cytisinicline arm as compared with 3.5% in the placebo group (p<0.001). Cytisinicline was well tolerated with a slight but significant increase in combined gastrointestinal AEs (upper abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia and dry mouth; cytisinicline 51/370 (13.8%) and placebo 30/370 (8.1%). Otherwise, the safety profile of cytisinicline was similar to that of placebo with no other significant differences in the rate of side effects in the two trial arms. 
 A summary of AEs reported in ten or more subjects in the TASC trial is included in the table below.

(1) | The incidence of events was analyzed according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities System Organ Class, or SOC, categorization and preferred terms. Participants who reported more than one event in a system category were counted only once for the category. SOC categories for other events (those reported by fewer than 10 participants) were as follows: general (five events within cytisine and five with placebo), cardiac (four with cytisine and two with placebo), musculoskeletal and connective tissue (three with cytisine and three with placebo), infections (one with placebo), immune system (one with placebo) and metabolism and nutrition (one with placebo).

 CASCAID Trial
 The second investigator led Phase 3 trial, the Cytisine As a Smoking Cessation Aid, or CASCAID, non-inferiority trial, was sponsored by the Health Research Council of New Zealand and was an open-label trial that randomized 1,310 adult daily heavy smokers. Patients were randomized to receive either cytisinicline for 25 days or NRT for 8 weeks. Both treatment groups were offered low intensity telephone behavioral support during trial treatment. The primary outcome measure was continuous self-reported abstinence from smoking one month after quit date. The CASCAID trial was conducted by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. We, through Sopharma, provided the cytisinicline in the form of commercial Tabex™ used in this trial.
 16


The results of the CASCAID trial, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December 2014, showed that cytisinicline was superior to NRT for smoking cessation and, specifically, that cytisinicline had an OR of 1.43 for sustained six-month abstinence (the OR standard measure of association between an exposure (cytisinicline treatment) and an outcome (continuous smoking abstinence) in this study, indicated that smokers receiving cytisinicline were 1.43 times more likely to stop smoking compared to receiving NRT for six months). The rate of continuous one-month abstinence was 40% in the cytisinicline arm as compared with 31% in the NRT arm (p<0.001). A secondary outcome included the rate of continuous six-month abstinence which was 22% in the cytisinicline arm as compared with 15% in the NRT arm (p=0.002). Cytisinicline was generally well tolerated, although self-reported AEs were slightly higher in the cytisinicline arm compared with the NRT arm. The most frequent AEs for cytisinicline were nausea and vomiting (30/665 (4.6%)) and sleep disorders (28/665 (4.2%)). Reports of these same AEs in the NRT arm were as follows: nausea and vomiting (2/655 (0.3%)) and sleep disorders (2/655 (0.3%)). 
 
A summary of AEs reported in subjects in the CASCAID trial is included in the table below.

 RAUORA Trial
 The third investigator led Phase 3 trial was a non-inferiority study comparing cytisinicline to Chantix (varenicline) in Māori (indigenous New Zealanders) and whānau (family) of Māori. The study was led by Dr. Natalie Walker, Associate Professor at the University of Auckland, and was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. In total, 1,105 Māori or whānau expressed interest in participating in the study and a total of 679 were randomized to receive either cytisinicline or varenicline. The average age of participants in the trial was 43 years and approximately 70% of the participants were women.
 
17



The study compared cytisinicline administered on a schedule of 25 days of declining titration followed by twice-daily dosing for a total of 12 weeks with varenicline administered on a schedule of seven days of inclining titration followed by twice-daily dosing for a total of 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was a comparison of biochemically confirmed continuous abstinence rates at 6 months, and the trial was designed to assess if the two agents were non-inferior to each other. We, through Sopharma, provided the cytisinicline in the form of commercial Tabex™ used in this trial.
 
Topline results indicated that the RAUORA trial achieved statistical significance in showing that cytisinicline plus behavioral support was at least as effective as varenicline plus behavioral support at 6 months. In addition, the trial showed that cytisinicline resulted in significantly fewer reported nausea adverse events as well as significantly fewer overall adverse events when compared to varenicline (p<0.001). 
 
The final RAUORA trial results and additional analyses were presented at the SRNT European Annual Meeting in September 2020 and were published in the Journal Addiction in 2021. The primary endpoint of the non-inferiority trial was to demonstrate that cytisinicline quit rates would be no less than 10% lower than the quit rates for varenicline. Results showed that cytisinicline met the pre-specified non-inferiority endpoint and was trending towards superiority with an Absolute Risk Difference of +4.29 in favor of cytisinicline (95% CI -0.22 to 8.79), demonstrating a 4.29% improvement in quit rates in favor of cytisinicline. Specifically, continuous abstinence rates at 6 months, verified by expired CO, were 12.1% for cytisinicline compared to 7.9% for varenicline. The Relative Risk was 1.55 on an intent-to-treat basis, indicating that subjects in the cytisinicline arm were approximately one and a half times more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months compared to subjects who received varenicline.
 
Additionally, significantly fewer overall AEs were reported in cytisinicline-treated subjects (Relative Risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.65, p<0.001). Notably, of the subjects who experienced adverse events (111 in the cytisinicline arm compared to 138 in the varenicline arm), there was significantly less nausea and vivid dreams with cytisinicline treatment compared to varenicline treatment.
 Safety Reporting 
 As cytisinicline has been marketed in Central and Eastern Europe for over 20 years, substantial safety reporting exists for cytisinicline. Sopharma has not reported any new safety signals with cytisinicline and there have not been any changes to the expected benefit or risk of cytisinicline treatment.
OVERVIEW OF SMOKING CESSATION MARKET AND TREATMENT OPTIONS 
 Overview of the Tobacco Epidemic
 Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death worldwide and in the United States. The World Health Organization, or WHO, estimates that there are approximately 1.3 billion tobacco users globally and that tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year. More than 7 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use, while around 1.2 million are the result of the exposure of non-smokers to second-hand smoke.  
 Cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States, including more than 41,000 deaths resulting from exposure to second-hand smoke, which equates to about one in five deaths annually, or 1,300 deaths every day. 
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, estimates that the annual cost of smoking related illnesses in the United States is more than $300 billion in direct medical care and lost productivity. Over 16 million people in the United States are living with a disease caused by smoking. Among these diseases are cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also increases risk for tuberculosis, certain eye diseases and problems of the immune system, including rheumatoid arthritis. More than 87% of lung cancer deaths, 61% of all pulmonary disease deaths, and 32% of all deaths from coronary heart disease are attributable to smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke according to the CDC. Tobacco smoking is highly addictive, and research suggests that nicotine may be as addictive as heroin, cocaine and alcohol. The CDC estimates that more people in the United States are addicted to nicotine than any other drug and reports that, in 2015, nearly 70% of smokers desired to quit and 55% made an attempt to do so in the prior year. Despite the high number of attempts, fewer than one in ten people are successful in their attempt to quit each year. Additionally, up to 60% of people who quit smoking relapse in the first year.

One increasingly popular alternative to smoking is the use of e-cigarettes, or vaping, which deliver liquid nicotine into a mist or vapor which is inhaled.  This method of consumption avoids the chemicals that are associated with cigarette smoke but may have other associated health and safety issues. The emerging use of e-cigarettes is contributing to the growing population of people who are addicted to nicotine. 
 According to data from the National Health Interview Survey, published by the CDC in November 2020, it is estimated that nearly 11 million adults in the United States used e-cigarettes in 2019.  
 In a study that we conducted and that was presented at the 2021 SRNT Annual Meeting, surveying approximately 500 users of nicotine vaping devices or e-cigarettes, approximately 73% of participants responded that they intend to quit vaping within the next three to 12 months. Of those who intended to quit even sooner, within the next 3 months, more than half stated they would be extremely likely to try a new prescription product to help them do so. We believe that cytisinicline, if approved, could be the first prescription drug indicated for vape and e-cigarette users who are ready to quit their nicotine addiction.
 
Overview of Smoking Cessation Marketplace & Treatments 
 According to DelveInsight’s 2020 report “Smoking Cessation Market Insights, Epidemiology and Market Forecast”, global revenues for prescription smoking cessation therapies are estimated to reach $5.6 billion by 2030. 
 Only two non-nicotine, prescription treatments for smoking cessation are currently available in the United States: “varenicline” (formerly marketed by Pfizer as Chantix) and “bupropion” (formerly marketed by GlaxoSmithKline as Zyban). Both are currently available as generic formulations. Varenicline requires a three-month treatment period and bupropion is recommended for a period between seven and 12 weeks. While both have been proven effective in aiding smoking cessation, they are also associated with significant side effects and early discontinuations from treatment. Varenicline’s labeling indicates elevated instances of nausea, abnormal dreams, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting may be experienced by varenicline-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients, and buproprion’s product label discloses potential adverse reactions including insomnia, rhinitis, dry mouth, dizziness, nervous disturbance, anxiety, nausea, constipation, arthralgia and seizures. High uptake into the brain combined with activity at “off target” receptors could be responsible for varenicline’s adverse event profile.
 In June 2021, Pfizer Inc. halted the distribution of Chantix after heightened levels, above the FDA’s acceptable daily intake limit, of nitrosamines were found in some lots of Chantix pills. In September 2021, Pfizer announced a nationwide recall in the United States of all lots of Chantix and have also withdrawn the product in other countries around the globe. Prior to market withdrawal and launch of generic Chantix (varenicline), global sales of branded Chantix peaked at $1.1 billion. Of those sales, approximately 75% were attributable to the U.S. market.
 The vast majority of OTC smoking cessation aids are NRTs. NRTs come in many forms, including gums, lozenges and patches, and have been shown to be less effective than prescription drugs. For example, a Cochrane Group independent database review of nicotine receptor partial agonists published in 2016 compared varenicline with a number of NRTs and varenicline has been proven to be more effective than the NRTs, as demonstrated in head-to-head studies.
 
LICENSE & SUPPLY AGREEMENTS 
 Sopharma  
 In 2009 and 2010, we entered into a license agreement, or the Sopharma License Agreement, and a supply agreement, or the Sopharma Supply Agreement, with Sopharma. Pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement, we were granted access to all available manufacturing, efficacy and safety data related to cytisinicline, as well as a granted patent in several European countries including Germany, France and Italy related to oral dosage forms of cytisinicline. Additional rights granted under the Sopharma License Agreement include the exclusive use of, and the right to sublicense, the trademark Tabex in all territories—other than certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, as well as Vietnam, where Sopharma or its affiliates and agents already market Tabex—in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of products. Under the Sopharma License Agreement, we agreed to pay a nonrefundable license fee. In addition, we agreed to make certain royalty payments equal to a mid-teens percentage of all net sales of Tabex branded products in our territory during the term of the Sopharma License Agreement, including those sold by a third party pursuant to any sublicense which may be granted by us. We have agreed to cooperate with Sopharma in the defense against any actual or threatened infringement claims with respect to Tabex. Sopharma has the right to terminate the Sopharma License Agreement upon the termination or expiration of the Sopharma Supply Agreement. The Sopharma License Agreement will also terminate under customary termination provisions including bankruptcy or insolvency and material breach. To date, any amounts paid to Sopharma pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement have been immaterial.
 19


A cross-license exists between us and Sopharma whereby we grant to Sopharma rights to any patents or patent applications or other intellectual property rights filed by us in Sopharma territories. 
 On May 14, 2015, we and Sopharma entered into an amendment to the Sopharma License Agreement. Among other things, the amendment to the Sopharma License Agreement reduced the royalty payments payable by us to Sopharma from a percentage in the mid-teens to a percentage in the mid-single digits and extended the term of the Sopharma License Agreement until May 26, 2029. 
 On July 28, 2017, we and Sopharma entered into the amended and restated Sopharma Supply Agreement. Pursuant to the amended and restated Sopharma Supply Agreement, for territories as detailed in the licensing agreement, we will exclusively purchase all of our cytisinicline from Sopharma, and Sopharma agrees to exclusively supply all such cytisinicline requested by us, and we extended the term to 2037. In addition, we will have full access to the cytisinicline supply chain and Sopharma will manufacture sufficient cytisinicline to meet a forecast for a specified demand of cytisinicline for the five years commencing shortly after the commencement of the agreement, with the forecast to be updated regularly thereafter. Each of us and Sopharma may terminate the Sopharma Supply Agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach or bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 University of Bristol 
 In July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Bristol, or the University of Bristol License Agreement. Under the University of Bristol License Agreement, we received exclusive and nonexclusive licenses from the University of Bristol to certain patent and technology rights resulting from research activities into cytisinicline and its derivatives for use in smoking cessation, including a number of patent applications related to novel approaches to cytisinicline binding at the nicotinic receptor level. Any patents issued in connection with these applications would be scheduled to expire on February 5, 2036, at the earliest. 
 In consideration of rights granted by the University of Bristol, we agreed to pay amounts of up to $3.2 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the University of Bristol License Agreement. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize product candidates subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement, we are responsible for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. 
 On January 22, 2018, we and the University of Bristol entered into an amendment to the University of Bristol License Agreement. Pursuant to the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, we received exclusive rights for all human medicinal uses of cytisinicline across all therapeutic categories from the University of Bristol from research activities into cytisinicline and its derivatives. In consideration of rights granted by the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, we agreed to pay an initial amount of $37,500 upon the execution of the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, and additional amounts of up to $1.7 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, in addition to amounts under the original University of Bristol License Agreement of up to $3.2 million in the aggregate, tied to specific financing, development and commercialization milestones. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize any product candidate subject to the amended University of Bristol License Agreement or to the original University of Bristol License Agreement, we will be responsible, as provided in the original University of Bristol License Agreement, for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. Up to December 31, 2022, we had paid the University of Bristol $125,000 pursuant to the University of Bristol License Agreement.
 Unless otherwise terminated, the University of Bristol License Agreement will continue until the earlier of July 2036 or the expiration of the last patent claim subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement. We may terminate the University of Bristol License Agreement for convenience upon a specified number of days’ prior notice to the University of Bristol. The University of Bristol License Agreement will terminate under customary termination provisions including bankruptcy or insolvency or its material breach of the agreement. Under the terms of the University of Bristol License Agreement, we had provided 100 grams of cytisinicline to the University of Bristol as an initial contribution. 
 Summary of Milestone Obligations by Product Candidate 
 The following table sets forth the milestones that we may be required to pay to third parties under the license agreements described above. As described above, we will also be required to pay certain revenue-based royalties with respect to our product candidate. 

Milestone Obligations to Third Parties | Amount Payable 
---------------------------------------+--------------------
University of Bristol | Up to $4,837,500(1)


(1) | Payable in connection with specific financing, development and commercialization milestones.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 We are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the principal regulating authority is the FDA. The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of product candidates and research, quality, manufacturing processes, product approval and promotion, advertising and product labeling. In the EU, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and national regulatory agencies regulate the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of product candidates, and oversee the procedures for approval of drugs for the EU and European Economic Area, or EEA, countries similar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates prices. Health authorities in many middle- and lower-income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority, such as the FDA or EMA, before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval.
United States
 We intend to focus initially on clinical development and regulatory approval of cytisinicline in the United States. It is anticipated that cytisinicline tablets would receive a minimum five years of data exclusivity under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
 Before a new pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States, the FDA must approve an NDA for a new drug. The steps required before the FDA will approve an NDA generally include non-clinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the trial sponsor; sponsor submission of the NDA application to the FDA for review; the FDA’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness; and the FDA’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured.
 As a condition of product approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct post-marketing clinical trials, known as Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of the approved product. The FDA may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market trials and programs. Any modifications to a drug, including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require the submission and approval of a new or supplemental NDA before the modification can be implemented, which may require that we generate additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. Our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product, and adherence to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, which regulate all aspects of the manufacturing process. We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls or seizures, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
 Sales and Marketing. The marketing practices of U.S. pharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical or medical device company from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to any particular industry practices, including the marketing practices of pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The U.S. federal government and various states have also enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical or medical device companies. These laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers; require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions; and/or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.
 21


Healthcare Reform. The United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry. In March 2020, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Healthcare Reform Law, was passed and included changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry, such as:
 
 
• | Increasing drug rebates paid to state Medicaid programs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand name and generic prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care;


• | Requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide discounts on brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause the beneficiaries to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap; and


• | Imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.

 The ACA includes provisions designed to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance. Specifically, since 2014, the ACA has required most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance and has offered states the option of expanding Medicaid coverage to additional individuals. Additionally, policy efforts designed specifically to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for medicines could result in new mandatory rebates and discounts or other pricing restrictions. Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.
 Pricing and Reimbursement. Pricing for our pharmaceutical products will depend in part on government regulation. We will likely be required to offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. We will also be required to report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose us to penalties.
 In the United States, Medicaid currently covers all smoking cessation products including varenicline and bupropion. The ACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Section 2502 of the ACA specifies that tobacco cessation medications will be removed from the list of optional medications and required for inclusion in states’ prescription drug benefit. On May 2, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, provided guidance into insurance coverage policy that health plans would be in compliance if they cover, among other items, screening for tobacco use, individual, group and phone counseling, all FDA approved tobacco cessation medications (both prescription and OTC) when prescribed by a healthcare provider, at least two quit attempts per year, four sessions of counseling and 90 days of treatment, with no cost sharing (co-pay) required.
 Government and private third-party payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states are considering a variety of cost-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments.
 There have also been multiple recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and adopted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics. In addition, Congress and multiple presidential administrations have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. These initiatives recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act, or the IRA, in August 2022, which will, among other things, allows HHS to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least seven years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price beginning in October 2023 and penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. We anticipate that additional state and federal healthcare measures could be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or lower pricing for cytisinicline, or additional pricing pressures.
 22


Anti-Corruption. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have sought to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.
 Outside the United States
 We expect to encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we seek to develop and commercialize cytisinicline.
 New Drug Approvals and Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EU Centralized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the EEA countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the EU and EEA than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country.
 In 2012, new pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in the EU. Key changes included the establishment of a new Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee within the EMA, with responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EU authorities. It also introduced the possibility for regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. Outside developed markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are typically less extensive.
 Health authorities in many middle- and lower-income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or the EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval. These requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the United States and Europe.
 CONTRACT RESEARCH AGREEMENTS 
 Our strategy is to outsource certain product development activities and have established contract research agreements for, non-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and some data management services. We choose which business or institution to use for these services based on their expertise, capacity and reputation and the cost of the service. 
 We also provide or have provided quantities of our product candidates to academic research institutions to investigate the mechanism of action and evaluate novel combinations of product candidates with other cancer therapies in various cancer indications. These collaborations expand our research activities for our product candidates with modest contribution from us. 
 MANUFACTURING 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of cytisinicline, though we may develop our own manufacturing operations in the future. We currently depend on Sopharma as supplier and contract manufacturer for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product for our clinical trials. In addition to our Sopharma relationship, we utilize contract manufacturing organizations for the clinical packaging supplies of cytisinicline. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our clinical manufacturing activities.
 Sopharma sources cytisinicline from the Laburnum anagyroides plant, a shrub or small tree native to, and widely distributed throughout, Bulgaria, south Central Europe and the northwestern Balkan Peninsula. The seed pods are harvested from the shrubs and dried. Each tree takes approximately four to six years to reach maturity for harvesting and has a productive life expectancy of 20 to 25 years. Seeds are harvested annually, dried and stored for processing into cytisinicline.  Laburnum anagyroide seeds in their natural state are highly toxic and the extraction process removes the toxins to produce highly purified cytisinicline. Sopharma controls a number of Laburnum orchards throughout Bulgaria in addition to sourcing seeds and cytisinicline starting material from certain third-party suppliers. We expect Sopharma to continue stockpiling cytisinicline to meet the projected demand from us upon commercial launch.
 23


The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing process utilizes a series of techniques including milling, solvent extraction, filtration and purification. Critical control steps and manufacturing intermediates have been identified and are controlled by internally developed specifications and methods to ensure a consistent and reproducible process. The highly purified cytisinicline is dried, sieved and packed for storage until further processing into drug product. The cytisinicline API manufacturing process has been developed and refined over many years of manufacture by Sopharma, which has significant expertise in manufacturing cytisinicline.
 Sopharma manufactures cytisinicline API in its facilities in Bulgaria, which are near the capital, Sofia. The API processing facility complies with EU cGMP requirements and has been inspected by the Bulgarian Drug Agency. During 2022, Sopharma built a new API facility specifically for cytisinicline within its tableting plant in Sofia. 
 Raw materials are essential to our business and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of our business. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials has not historically had a material adverse effect on our financial results; however, uncertainties in supply chain, transportation logistics and costs, and political and economic conditions could result in disruptions in our operations and materially impact our financial results.
 SALES AND MARKETING
 Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force or the establishment of our own commercial marketing and sales infrastructure. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives including the potential to market and distribute directly to consumers via traditional and virtual channels. We intend to seek commercial partnerships in ex-U.S. territories.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 The U.S. Supreme Court has held that certain claims to naturally occurring substances are not patentable. Cytisinicline is a naturally occurring product and, therefore, the compound itself is not patentable in the United States. Furthermore, cytisinicline has been used in other parts of the world for decades, creating further challenges to patenting uses of the compound.
 Our development and commercialization of cytisinicline is protected by our exclusive supply agreement with Sopharma and Sopharma’s proprietary technology, experience and expertise in cytisinicline extraction. In addition, we intend to utilize market exclusivity laws including those under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States and exclusivity under Directive 2004/27/EC in the EU.
 
Additionally, we are actively building an intellectual property portfolio around our clinical-stage product candidate and research programs. A key component of this portfolio strategy is to seek international patent protection with patent applications in the United States and in major market countries that we consider important to the development of our business. As of December 31, 2022, we own a portfolio of four patent families. Those families cover cytisinicline derivatives (being prosecuted in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, U.K. and Japan), novel cytisinicline salts (being prosecuted in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand with issued patents in the U.K., Canada, United States, Mexico and South Africa), and novel cytisinicline dosing methods being prosecuted in the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and New Zealand, with issued patents in the United States. Additionally, we have in-licensed rights from Sopharma to two patent families relating to a new method of cytisinicline extraction, as well as cytisinicline formulations and one family from a third party relating to cytisine purity. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or in-licensed 15 issued patents, three allowed patent applications and 43 pending patent applications. These patents have expirations dates ranging from 2037 to 2042, absent any term adjustments or extensions.
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, trademark protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business.  We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them. 
 
24



COMPETITION 
 The development and commercialization of new products is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide with respect to smoking cessation and other product candidates that they may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. We are aware that many companies have therapeutics marketed or in development for smoking cessation. We expect that our competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, significant resources to aggressively develop and commercialize their products in order to take advantage of the significant market opportunity.
 Prescription and Over-the-Counter Treatments
 Only two non-nicotine, prescription treatments for smoking cessation are currently available in the United States; “varenicline” (formerly marketed by Pfizer as Chantix) and “bupropion” (formerly marketed by GlaxoSmithKline as Zyban). Both are currently available as generic formulations. Varenicline requires a three-month treatment period and bupropion is recommended for a period between seven and 12 weeks. While both have been proven effective in aiding smoking cessation, they are also associated with significant side effects and early discontinuations from treatment. Varenicline’s labeling indicates elevated instances of nausea, abnormal dreams, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting may be experienced by varenicline-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients, and bupropion’s product label discloses potential adverse reactions including insomnia, rhinitis, dry mouth, dizziness, nervous disturbance, anxiety, nausea, constipation, arthralgia and seizures. High uptake into the brain combined with activity at “off target” receptors could be responsible for varenicline’s adverse event profile.
 In June 2021, Pfizer Inc. halted the distribution of Chantix after heightened levels, above the FDA’s acceptable daily intake limit, of nitrosamines were found in some lots of Chantix pills. In September 2021, Pfizer announced a nationwide recall in the United States of all lots of Chantix and have also withdrawn the product in other countries around the globe. Prior to market withdrawal and launch of generic Chantix (varenicline), global sales of branded Chantix peaked at $1.1 billion. Of those sales, approximately 75% were attributable to the U.S. market.
 The most common OTC treatments bought in pharmacies for smoking cessation in the United States and worldwide are NRTs such as nicotine gums, nicotine lozenges, and nicotine patches. Each of these products delivers nicotine to the body although they generally do so at different rates and to different parts of the body than does a traditional cigarette. As concluded by the authors of several published clinical trials conducted by others, these therapies are generally less effective than prescription treatments. Recognized brands include Niquitin , Nicotinell , Nicorette  and Nicoderm. Depending on the duration of treatment, the average cost of certain OTC smoking cessation treatments can exceed prescription treatments.
 Pharmaceutical companies, including larger companies in the industry, who have extensive expertise in non-clinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for products, may develop other OTC treatments for smoking cessation. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 20 employees, of whom eleven were engaged in research and development functions, including clinical development, regulatory affairs and manufacturing, and nine were engaged in general and administrative functions, including accounting and finance, administration, and commercial. 
 All of our employees have entered into non-disclosure agreements regarding our intellectual property, trade secrets and other confidential information. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppages. We believe that we maintain satisfactory relations with our employees. 
 From time to time, we also use outside consultants to provide advice on our clinical development plans, research programs, administration and potential acquisitions of new technologies. 
 We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee engagement, development, and training, talent acquisition and retention, employee safety and wellness, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off.
