Item 1. Business Overview
We provide a technology solution to automate the purchase and sale of digital advertising inventory for buyers and sellers. Our platform features applications and services for digital advertising inventory sellers, including websites, mobile applications and other digital media properties, to sell their advertising inventory; applications and services for buyers, including advertisers, agencies, agency trading desks, and demand side platforms, or DSPs, to buy advertising inventory; and a marketplace over which such transactions are executed. Together, these features power and enhance a comprehensive, transparent, independent advertising marketplace that brings buyers and sellers together and facilitates intelligent decision-making and automated transaction execution for the advertising inventory we manage on our platform. Our clients include many of the world’s leading publishers of websites and mobile applications and buyers of digital advertising inventory. 
Advertising inventory takes different forms, referred to as advertising units, is purchased and sold through different transactional methodologies, and allows advertising content to be presented to users through different channels. Our solution enables buyers and sellers to purchase and sell:
•a comprehensive range of advertising units, including display, audio and video;

• | that are transacted through real-time bidding ("RTB"), which includes (i) direct sale of premium inventory, which we refer to as private marketplace ("PMP"), and (ii) open auction bidding, which we refer to as open marketplace ("OMP"); and


• | that are displayed across digital channels, including mobile web, mobile application, and desktop, as well as across various out-of-home channels, such as digital billboards.

We believe our platform reaches approximately one billion users globally. Sellers of digital advertising inventory use our platform to generate revenue by monetizing their advertising inventory across transaction types, advertising units, and channels 
through accessing a global market of buyers representing top advertiser brands. We also help sellers decrease costs and protect their brands and user experience.
At the same time, buyers leverage our platform to manage their advertising spending and reach their target audiences across transaction types, advertising units, and channels, simplify order management and campaign tracking, obtain actionable insights into audiences for their advertising, and access impression-level purchasing from hundreds of sellers. 
We generate revenue from the buying and selling of digital advertising inventory transacted on our platform. Digital advertising inventory is created when users access sellers’ content. Sellers provide digital advertising inventory to our platform in the form of advertising requests, or ad requests. When we receive ad requests from sellers, we send bid requests to buyers, which enable buyers to bid on sellers’ digital advertising inventory. Winning bids can place advertising, or paid impressions, for the seller to present to the user. The volume of paid impressions measured as a percentage of ad requests is referred to as fill rate. The price that buyers pay for each thousand paid impressions purchased is measured in units referred to as CPM. We refer to the total volume of spending between buyers and sellers on our platform as advertising spend. We keep a percentage of that advertising spend as a fee, and we pass the rest through to the seller. The fee that we retain from the gross advertising spend on our platform is our revenue. Our fee, measured as a percentage of advertising spend, is referred to as our take rate.    
Our platform incorporates proprietary machine-learning algorithms, sophisticated data processing, robust high-volume analytics capabilities, and a distributed infrastructure. Our solution is constantly improving based on our systems’ ability to process and learn from vast volumes of data in real time.
During the early stages of our business following our incorporation in April 2007, our solution matched sellers’ inventory to appropriate buyers by offering impressions to different buyers in sequence. During 2010, we added RTB capabilities, creating a real-time open-market auction allowing all buyers accessing our platform to compete to purchase all of the advertising inventory that sellers made available to our platform. During 2012, we launched our PMP application, which allows sellers to connect directly with their pre-approved buyers to execute direct sales of previously unsold advertising inventory. 
In 2016, we introduced our header bidding solution. In addition, we began to focus further on development of our video solution, helping grow our product footprint to allow our sellers to sell video advertising inventory across desktop or mobile platforms, and include instream, outstream and mobile-specific formats such as interstitials. 
In 2017, we acquired nToggle, Inc. ("nToggle"), a provider of technology to make it easier and more cost effective for programmatic buyers to find the inventory they are looking for among the billions of bid requests they receive each day. Header bidding has dramatically increased the volume of bid requests sent to buyers, increasing buyers’ processing costs and making it more difficult for them to find the impressions they want. nToggle technology utilizes analytical and data science techniques to help shape real-time bidding requests, optimize traffic, and reduce the number of duplicates and irrelevant bid requests DSPs must process. The technology also helps us manage our infrastructure costs and increase our aggregate ingestion capacity by filtering out impressions that are not in demand before they are processed through the bid stream. The technology also allows us to optimize traffic toward DSPs and buyers based on their unique, historical buying behaviors, leading to an overall expansion of relevant bid requests to DSPs unable or unwilling to process the full stream of real-time bidding requests available from our platform.
In 2018, we made first-price our default auction dynamic for header bidding due to increased competition inherent in header bidding, which led other exchanges to submit bids on a first-price basis, rendering our second-price auction methodology less competitive. This allowed us to improve the rate at which we win header-bidding auctions. To support buyers that needed some time to adapt their systems and bidding strategies to first-price auction dynamics, or may not want to make those adaptations themselves, we developed our Estimated Market Rate (“EMR”) feature. This feature uses algorithms that monitor existing market conditions against our dataset of auction outcomes to look for opportunities to reduce the amount of the bid that we pass through to the downstream auction on behalf of our winning bidder, while maintaining high fill rates. This is intended to help buyers avoid overpaying for impressions while providing sellers with more stable, predictable demand.
We operate our business on a worldwide basis, with an established operating presence in North America and Europe and a developing presence in Asia, Australia, and South America. Substantially all of our assets are U.S. assets. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries and operations perform primarily sales, marketing, and service functions. 
Recent Developments
The ad tech market is demanding more efficiency and lower cost from intermediaries like us. In an effort to be more competitive in attracting demand and capturing inventory supply, we made a strategic decision in mid-2017 to reduce the fees we charged buyers in OMP transactions. In addition, in 2017 our business mix shifted to a higher proportion of header bidding transactions, and we charged lower buyer fees for header bidding transactions in order to pass higher bids to the downstream 
decisioning process. Finally, in response to increasing market pressure and in an effort to be more competitive, on November 1, 2017, we eliminated our buyer transaction fees altogether. Throughout 2018, our focus was to increase the volume of transactions we process in order to offset the lower fees. 
Buyer transaction fees represented approximately 49% of our revenue for the first ten months of 2017, which is the period during which we charged buyer fees in 2017, and represented approximately 43% of our revenue in 2017. Consequently, the elimination of our buyer transaction fees had a severe adverse effect on our revenue and margins since there were no buyer fees included in revenue for 2018. A critical part of our plan to adjust to our lower take rates is to increase advertising spending on our platform and operate with improved efficiency that will support lower margins. To increase our advertising spend, we have taken steps to increase significantly the ad requests coming from our seller clients. Our plans for increasing our inventory volumes have included active pursuit of more direct relationships with sellers, particularly of mobile, video, and PMP impressions, which are areas of industry growth. We have increased our access to ad requests that might not otherwise be accessible to us by utilizing header bidding technologies, including our own solution built on the Prebid open source architecture we helped advance, as well as third-party wrappers, and also integrating with large sources of supply that have their own monetization capabilities but also allow third parties to connect to their exchanges and bid on their inventory. 
The industry-wide growth of header bidding has given us access to more advertising inventory, but has also exposed inventory to more competing sources of demand. As a result, we have significantly lower fill rates for header bidding transactions, and as the percentage of our overall transactions conducted through header bidding increases, our overall fill rates decrease. In an effort to increase our header bidding fill rates, in addition to our plans described above, we have made adjustments to our auction dynamics in header bidding transactions such as reducing timeouts, working with publishers to fix legacy publisher RTB rules files, increasing the number of user match rates across multiple devices, and fixed other technical mapping related issues. Historically, we conducted our RTB auctions based upon second-price principles, consistent with widespread industry practice. However, as header bidding increased competition for available inventory, some competing exchanges began submitting bids in header bidding auctions on a first-price or modified-first-price basis to increase their chances of winning. This put our buyers at a competitive disadvantage in these transactions and also created some confusion in the market, as it was often unclear how competing buyers were formulating their bids. In an effort to capture more inventory for our buyers and deliver better monetization to our sellers, and to provide better transparency and predictability to all our clients, effective as of January 22, 2018, we made first price our default auction dynamic for header bidding transactions. This means that the first price or highest bid in our auction wins and that first price is passed to the downstream auction. Because buyers may need some time to adapt their systems and bidding strategies to first-price auction dynamics, or may not wish to make those adaptations themselves, we have implemented an optional feature called EMR, described above. 
Supply Path Optimization, or SPO, is a new practice emerging in 2018 referring to the practice of deliberately choosing a specific source of supply through which buyers will procure their media. SPO is important to buyers because it can help reduce their costs and gain efficiencies, and largely because of header bidding, they are able to choose the best partner (or small number of partners) without limiting the available inventory to bid on. There are a number of criteria that buyers use to evaluate supply partners, including transparency, cost, the quality of the inventory, and whether or not a supply partner meets standards around ads.txt compliance, GDPR compliance, brand safety, and remediation of fraudulent traffic. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from supply path optimization due to being a lower-cost provider as a result of the removal of buyer fees, our EMR feature, our transparency, and our brand safety measures.
While we work to increase the volume of transactions on our exchange and compete more effectively, we must operate efficiently to relieve the pressure on our margins and cash resources that has resulted from our fee reductions and increased infrastructure required to support the increased volume of bid requests generated through header bidding and the increased volume of transactions that our growth plans require. We believe that increasing our revenue through transaction volume while still offering competitive fees to our buyers and sellers, paired with cost reduction measures we undertook in 2018 and ongoing cost discipline, will establish us as a lower cost exchange. Our cost reduction measures have included headcount reductions of approximately 250 people since late 2016, including approximately 100 people in 2018, driving an overall workforce reduction of 39% from September 30, 2016 to December 31, 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, we undertook various cost control initiatives including reductions in administrative staff to bring our general and administrative operations into better alignment with the current size of the business as well as in sales and technical personnel as a result of offshoring certain development functions, organizational delayering and restructuring, and reducing investment in unprofitable projects (see Note 14 of our "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"). As a result of our 2018 workforce reductions, combined with other non-headcount related operating expense reductions we undertook, we achieved our target of positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, we have reduced our capital expenditures to $19.9 million in 2018, which is less than half of the $40.4 million in capital expenditures incurred in 2017. We will continue to pursue increased automation and efficiency across all aspects of the company, including our technology stack. 
As a result of these efforts to increase the volume of advertising inventory transacted on our platform, we increased our advertising spend from $837.2 million in 2017 to $992.1 million in 2018. We have also been able to increase our revenue 
throughout 2018, despite a year-over-year decrease from 2017 due to the inclusion of revenue from buyer fees for the majority of 2017. Between continuing to generate increased advertising spend and stabilizing our take rate, we believe we are positioning ourselves for year-over-year revenue growth in future periods.
Our growth and cost-control strategies involve significant risk, as described in the “Risk Factors” section of this report.
Our Industry
Continued Shift Toward Digital Advertising
The increased delivery of content to users digitally over the Internet or through applications, as opposed to analog and print media, such as newspapers, magazines, broadcast radio, and television, has created an opportunity for buyers of advertising inventory to improve return on advertising investment by targeting audiences more accurately using data-driven strategies and delivering more relevant advertising in real time on multiple screens. Buyers are able to utilize various technologies to analyze data relating to return on investment, demographics, user behavior, location, and other attributes that enable them to create and deliver targeted advertisements to users, which helps achieve specific advertising goals. Technological advances have also enabled sellers to sell their inventory on an impression-by-impression basis, as well as in bulk, making it easier for sellers to enhance the monetization of their inventory. Therefore, advertising is continuing to shift with content to digital media.
Complicated and Manual Workflow for Direct Buying and Selling of Digital Advertising Inventory
Due to the size and complexity of the advertising ecosystem and purchasing process, manual processes cannot effectively manage digital advertising inventory at scale. In addition, both buyers and sellers are demanding more transparency, better controls and more relevant insights from their advertising inventory purchases and sales. Buyers and sellers benefit from a platform that enables them to leverage the targeting capabilities of their proprietary data assets. This has created a need to automate the digital advertising industry and to simplify the process of buying and selling advertising inventory.
A variety of factors make the digital advertising ecosystem highly complex and challenging to automate:

• | Perishable Inventory. A user’s visit to a website or mobile application creates a unique opportunity to reach the user by inserting advertisements into one or more of the impressions designed into the website or mobile application. In order to generate revenue for a seller these impressions must be filled before the page content loads.


• | Complex Impression-Level Matching. Sellers aim to sell impressions in order to generate revenue while enhancing the users’ experience and preserving the sellers’ brand. Buyers seek to purchase impression-level inventory to improve targeting of specific audiences and return on investment for their advertising spending.


• | Large Multi-Variate Datasets. Trillions of data points relating to browsing behavior, geographic information, user preferences, engagement with an advertisement, and effectiveness of an advertisement are created as users visit sellers’ websites and mobile applications. Each piece of data represents a valuable piece of information that can facilitate and improve current and subsequent targeting and monetization of impressions.


• | Fragmented Buyer and Seller Base. There is an enormous number and variety of buyers and sellers of digital advertising.


• | Brand Safety and Inventory Quality Concerns. Buyers want to avoid buying fraudulent or unauthorized inventory or being associated with content they consider inappropriate, competitive, or inconsistent with their advertising themes. Sellers want to prevent advertisements that are inappropriate, disruptive, competitively sensitive, or otherwise do not comport with their brand image from appearing on their websites or mobile applications, or that convey malware.


• | Consumer Experience Concerns. Consumers prefer digital advertising experiences that are relevant to their personal interests, non-intrusive, and do not detract from or slow down their enjoyment of digital content.


• | Large and Highly Unpredictable Traffic Volumes. The scale of user traffic and the dollar value of digital advertisements is growing and difficult to manage efficiently. A large seller may have tens of millions of users per month, creating hundreds of millions of monthly impressions. The volume of traffic for any given seller is extremely difficult to predict and requires a technology infrastructure that is large enough to handle variable volumes. As more advertising shifts to digital and digital advertising technologies evolve, larger and more diverse data processing capabilities are required.


• | Lack of Standardized Ad Formats and Data. An available advertising impression can vary based on a number of factors, such as seller, ad format, screen size, pricing mechanism, content type, and audience demographic. It is

challenging for buyers to efficiently evaluate and bid on trillions of impressions that are based on hundreds of ad formats in the context of millions of highly customized data fields.

• | Diverse Technology Demands. Even as advertising is shifting from traditional to digital media, a shift is underway within the digital advertising ecosystem from desktop to mobile channels. Desktop and mobile digital advertising involve different challenges and rely upon different technologies, requiring significant technological capabilities and innovation.


• | Increasing Privacy Demands. Privacy protection is becoming increasingly important to regulators, technology platforms, web and mobile browser applications and users on a regional and global basis, requiring constant adaptation to comply with legal and self-regulatory requirements while effectively matching buyers and sellers of inventory.

Rubicon Project: Competitive Strengths of Our Platform in the Digital Advertising Marketplace
Rubicon Project was founded to address the inherent challenges associated with the digital advertising ecosystem. Buyers can direct their spending towards the impressions that are of most value to them based on demographics, pricing, timing, and other targeting objectives. Sellers can improve revenue per impression, while adhering to their own specific rules around advertising that is permissible on their websites and mobile applications.
Serving a Broad Universe of Buyers and Sellers Across a Full Spectrum of Inventory Types, Advertising Units, and Channels Creates Network Effects
By accommodating a full spectrum of digital advertising inventory through various transaction types across multiple channels, our solution brings value to both buyers and sellers. Our sellers gain instant access to the world’s largest automated digital advertising buyers, including hundreds of DSPs with the flexibility to sell their advertising inventory in an automated fashion on an impression-by-impression basis, such as with OMP, in bulk, or in PMP transactions pursuant to arrangements directly between the seller and the buyer. Our buyers gain the ability to fulfill their audience needs in a cost-effective manner. Large numbers of diverse sellers on our platform attract more buyers and vice versa, resulting in a self-reinforcing network effect that adds value for all our clients and creates a strong platform for growth.
Private Marketplace Solutions Provide Unique Access to Quality Supply and Facilitate Transactions
A significant portion of premium inventory is purchased and sold through PMPs. Some sellers will continue to rely on their own sales forces for sales of premium inventory, but will benefit from automation to better price, match, and place campaigns, and to automate manual operations such as ad trafficking, quality assurance, and billing and collections. We have invested in workflow capabilities and automation of inventory transactions to enable sales teams to increase their productivity and process more sales of premium inventory at optimal prices. Workflow capabilities enable buyers and sellers to communicate directly and use shared data to execute campaigns. These capabilities support sales functions rather than replacing them, enhancing their adoption without friction. Buyers and sellers can also leverage their first-party data assets and third-party data assets in our platform to increase the value of sellers' inventory and the precision of buyers' targeting efforts. 
Big Data Analytics and Machine-Learning Algorithms
A core aspect of our value proposition is our big data and machine-learning platform that is able to discover unique insights from our massive data repositories containing proprietary information on ad requests, bid requests, bid responses, and served advertisements. Our systems collect and analyze variable pieces of information such as pricing of advertisements, historical clearing prices, bid responses, what types of ads are allowed on a particular website, which sellers’ websites a buyer prefers, what ad formats are available to be served, advertisement size and location, user location, which users a buyer wants to target, how many ads the user has seen, browser or device information, and sellers’ proprietary data about users. Our access to data puts us in a unique position to develop differentiated insights to help both buyers and sellers, and we have developed proprietary machine-learning algorithms that analyze trillions of these data points to enable our solution to make data-driven decisions in real time and to process high volumes of bid requests and responses. Our solution is constantly self-improving as we process more volume and accumulate more data, which in turn helps make our machine-learning algorithms more intelligent and contributes to higher-quality matching between buyers and sellers. This traffic optimization toward our DSP partners and buyers coupled with more aggressive filtering of non-monetizable traffic improves return on investment for buyers and increases revenue for sellers, which in turn attracts more buyers and sellers to our platform. We believe this self-reinforcing dynamic contributes to the dual network effects described above, creating a strong platform for growth.
Header Bidding Solution
Header bidding is effectively a change in the auction process by which, instead of allocating an impression to one exchange running a single auction, a publisher exposes the impression to multiple exchanges, each of which generally selects a winning bid through its own initial auction and passes that winning bid into a secondary auction to compete for the impression with all other participating exchanges’ bids. Sellers first embraced header bidding using a client-side solution, in which the browser of the user creating the impression runs the secondary auction. This solution increases competition for impressions and raises impression prices, but burdening the browser to perform the secondary auction increases load time for content and causes delays during execution. 
An emerging alternative header bidding protocol uses a server to conduct the secondary auction, which can reduce load times but presents its own challenges. Adding an additional step between the user’s browser and the demand source can cause increased latency and limit the amount of user data that is transmitted, contributing to difficulties in user data synchronizing and resulting in adverse effects on audience targeting. Server-side technology also significantly increases the volume of demand sources that can be accommodated, resulting in increased competition for impressions. Further, the host of the server used in a particular transaction has an advantage in user sync with its demand sources, at least until some form of universal user identification approach gains significant market adoption. 
In 2016, we entered the client-side header bidding space with our client-side solution, which we referred to as FastLane. In 2017, we began working on server-side header bidding and supported an open source industry solution we helped advance called Prebid. In October 2017, we launched our own open source server-side header bidding solution, which integrates with Prebid. Using these technologies, we are executing header bidding secondary auctions on behalf of our seller clients that implement our solution. To further the open source initiative, in 2017 we also helped to launch Prebid.org, Inc., an independent organization dedicated to the development and promotion of open-source header bidding solutions and other open-source tools to drive publisher monetization. There are two other primary server-side solutions, one provided by Amazon (called Amazon A9) and one provided by Google (called Google EB), and we are integrated with both. We believe the various header bidding alternatives we offer, our buyer reach and scale, our buying efficiency, and our machine learning capabilities put us in a strong position to compete for seller impressions, and we expect each of these header bidding solutions to deliver a meaningful volume of impressions.
Independence
Unlike some large industry participants, we do not have our own media properties that compete for advertising spending with our sellers. Our independence means we have none of the inherent conflicts of interests characterizing competing exchanges that sell their own inventory, giving our clients an important alternative to monetize and acquire inventory without subsidizing their competitors.
Platform Applications
To enhance the value our technology platform brings to the marketplace, we offer a number of applications to address the critical needs of buyers and sellers.
Applications for Sellers. We have direct relationships and integrations with the sellers on our platform. Our solution includes applications to help them increase their digital advertising revenue, reduce costs, protect their brands and user experience, and reach more buyers efficiently to increase digital advertising revenue by monetizing their full variety and volume of inventory. Our platform offers sellers many capabilities and benefits, including the following:

• | xAPI Technology That Allows Sellers to Easily Access Our Demand. Publishers normally face numerous technical challenges in accessing advertising demand. They either have to modify their web pages by adding cumbersome "ad tags," or they have to integrate monetization code into their mobile applications. Both of these methods create technical risk and are time consuming to implement. xAPI technology eliminates these requirements and makes it easy and fast with no impact to the web pages or apps of the publisher to access demand and fill ad slots.


• | Integrated Solution for Digital Advertising Needs. We provide sellers with a single web-based interface that serves as their central location to manage, analyze, and enhance digital advertising spending from hundreds of different buyers.


• | Header Bidding. We provide our own header bidding solutions to sellers to use as a platform for aggregating demand, and also to integrate with third-party header bidding solutions to provide demand to our sellers that use those third-party solutions as their header bidding platform. 


• | Private Marketplaces. Sellers can use our PMP capabilities to augment their own internal sales operations through better matching and pricing and process automation. 


• | Inventory Allocation. We offer a solution that helps sellers to increase revenue across advertising types and sales channels by allocating inventory efficiently between direct and indirect demand.


• | Significantly Streamlined Sales, Operations, and Finance Workflow. Our platform streamlines the management of digital advertisement sales by aggregating demand and providing a suite of software applications that automate the process of making inventory available for sale.


• | Security for Brand and User Experience. Our platform is designed to enable sellers to implement guidelines specifying what advertising content may not be shown on the seller’s website or mobile application.


• | Advanced Reporting and Analytics and Actionable Insights. We provide a robust set of reporting features that sellers can use to analyze the vast array of data we collect for them.


• | Consolidated Payments. We provide consolidated billing and collection for sellers that would otherwise be required to dedicate additional resources to cost-effectively manage financial relationships with a large base of buyers.


• | Protective Screening. We employ measures to protect sellers and users from malware (software that can infect computers with malicious software), check advertisements delivered through our solution for the presence of malicious or questionable activity or characteristics, and gather technical attributes to inform our matchmaking process.


• | Vantage. We provide an extension for Web browsers that lets sellers monitor ads served in context on their sites, providing insight, diagnostic applications, and ad-quality controls.


• | Creative Approval API. Our platform includes a programmatic interface that sellers can use to retrieve a comprehensive set of individual advertising creatives that have bid or served on their sites, and instruct our delivery systems to approve or reject those creatives for future impressions.

Applications for Buyers. Buyers leverage our applications to access a large audience and execute highly automated campaigns that take advantage of unique targeting data and technology as provided by our platform to purchase advertising inventory based on buyers' key demographic, economic, and timing criteria. These applications help streamline a buyer’s purchasing operations and increase the efficiency of its spending and the effectiveness of its advertising campaigns. Our platform offers buyers many capabilities and benefits, including the following:

• | Direct Access to a Global Audience and Hundreds of Premium Sellers. By leveraging our platform, we believe buyers can reach approximately one billion internet users globally, including through many of the world's largest and most premium sellers. Furthermore, unlike many organizations in the digital advertising industry, we have direct relationships with sellers and can enable buyers to circumvent a multi-step, expensive, and inefficient process to connect to the seller.


• | Private Marketplaces. Through our PMP capabilities, we enable buyers to access exclusive high-value inventory in a more controlled environment than in the open marketplace. 


• | Bid Stream Filtering. We provide technology to help buyers shape real-time bidding requests, optimize traffic, and reduce the number of duplicates and irrelevant or undesired bid requests they must process. This helps buyers find the inventory they are looking for more efficiently and reduces their data processing costs. 


• | Bid Reduction. Buyers participating in header bidding auctions, which we conduct on a first-price basis, may use our EMR technology, which uses our market data and proprietary algorithms to help buyers bid on advertising inventory consistent with market rates. 


• | Flexible Access to Inventory. Our platform allows buyers to purchase advertising inventory in their preferred manner, whether by OMP or PMP. Our solution also has the flexibility to allow buyers to integrate their purchases on our platform through their existing buying technologies or to buy directly through our platform.


• | Simplified Order Management and Campaign Tracking. By eliminating most manual steps, our applications enable buyers to manage their digital campaigns efficiently and effectively, and significantly reduce the time it would otherwise take to execute their digital advertising programs.


• | Transparency and Control Over Advertising Spending. Our platform is designed to let buyers know and control where their dollars are being spent. Buyers can easily navigate through our interface to choose the list of sellers they want to purchase inventory from and see an indicative price range that they should expect to pay.


• | Inventory Quality. We provide systems and processes to detect and minimize questionable inventory, such as non-human traffic and pirated content, and to enable labeling of inventory made available for sale so that buyers can make their own decisions about what meets the specific standards of campaigns they are running.


• | PubCheq. We maintain a comprehensive database of all inventory reviewed by internal systems and teams that powers a global blacklist that blocks fraudulent or otherwise problematic seller properties and users from entering the Rubicon Project marketplace and identifies non-human traffic that is fraudulently consuming advertising spend.

Growth Strategies
Two powerful market trends are affecting our business. First, our exchange volume historically consisted largely of OMP transactions conducted through an ad server waterfall for desktop display advertising, but this business is being displaced by other ad units, channels, and transaction types. Second, the ad tech market is demanding more efficiency and lower cost from intermediaries like us, and we believe market share will consolidate. Our strategy for growth in this context is to operate a high-volume, low cost per transaction exchange, and focus on high-growth ad units, channels and transaction types. 
Increase volumes and efficiencies and reduce transaction costs on our exchange.  We aim to increase our transaction volumes and to enhance the operational efficiency and value to clients of our exchange, enabling buyers and sellers to achieve their campaign and monetization objectives efficiently and to streamline the number of exchanges they work with. 

• | Increasing Inventory Supply. Increased transaction volume begins with ad requests from sellers, which represent the inventory available for buyers to purchase on our platform. Our plan for increasing our inventory volumes includes active pursuit of more direct relationships with sellers, particularly of mobile, video, and PMP impressions, which are areas of industry growth, and expanding seller tools. Our own header bidding solutions are an important element of our offering to large sellers. We also access ad requests that might not otherwise be accessible to us by connecting to third-party header bidding solutions such as Google EB and Amazon A9, as well as other third-party wrappers, and also integrate through our server-to-server xAPI technology with large sources of supply that have their own monetization capabilities but also allow third parties to connect to their exchanges and bid on their inventory. 


• | Elimination of Buyer Fees. During 2017, we reduced and ultimately eliminated the transaction fees we previously charged buyers for OMP transactions. As a result, our total take rate was approximately 11.6% as we exited 2017, which did not include any buyer fees. We believe our pricing is now competitive, and our low fees are intended to address the market's demand for lower costs and to attract more inventory and spending to our platform. Elimination of buyer fees also allows us to pass higher bids to the downstream auction in header bidding transactions, which should improve our fill rate. In addition, elimination of our buyer fees, as well as the auction dynamics and bid filtering described immediately below, reflect our intensified focus on buyers, which, through “supply path optimization” initiatives, are expected to concentrate their spending to fewer more efficient sources of advertising inventory. 


• | More Competitive Auction Dynamics. Increased competition inherent in header bidding led other exchanges to submit bids on a first-price basis, rendering our second-price auction methodology less competitive. Therefore, effective as of January 22, 2018, we made first-price our default auction dynamic for header bidding transactions, which has improved the rate at which we win header-bidding auctions. To support buyers that need some time to adapt their systems and bidding strategies to first-price auction dynamics, or may not wish to make those adaptations themselves, we provide our EMR feature. 


• | Bid Filtering. We continue to improve our fill rate by using the technology we acquired from nToggle to filter out low-quality impressions so that a higher proportion of the ad requests on our platform are of interest to our buyers, and to analyze market dynamics to optimize impressions toward our buyers, enabling them to identify and purchase the impressions they want more efficiently. In addition, we expect the nToggle filtering technology to help us and our buyers control the processing costs associated with higher volumes of ad requests and bid requests. 


• | Platform Enhancements. We are working on a number of platform innovations and enhancements designed to improve the value to clients and the operational efficiency of our platform. For example, new technology and techniques will improve upon our market-leading position in inventory and ad quality, responding to market demands for increased brand security and protection against fraud. Cookie-less targeting, including device-based user identifiers, will improve audience identification and match rates. Audience-based selling and enhanced measurement and viewability technologies will improve inventory values for sellers and campaign effectiveness 

for buyers. Impression filtering and virtual machine support will improve the efficiency and effective capacity of our data processing infrastructure.
Focus on emerging ad units, channels, and transaction types
Our business historically consisted largely of OMP transactions conducted through an ad server waterfall for desktop display advertising, which has declined significantly. In order for us to grow and compete effectively, we must continue to focus on areas of the digital advertising business that are experiencing growth and to adapt to evolution in the business. 

• | Mobile. We believe we can significantly expand the penetration of our mobile offerings among buyer and seller clients by creating and introducing new mobile ad formats, growing mobile advertising by brands with better measurement and decisioning data, and leveraging header bidding to improve returns for developers. Mobile includes mobile web pages as well as mobile applications.


• | Audiences. We aim to develop technology to enable buyers and sellers to safely leverage their first-party data assets and third-party data assets in our platform to increase the value of sellers' inventory and the precision of buyers' targeting efforts, and to drive more precise matching of buyer demand to seller inventory. As the world continues to move more toward an app-centric consumption of the Internet, our concept of identity is evolving away from the browser cookie and into more sophisticated ID-agnostic systems and technology.


• | Header Bidding. We will invest in continued improvement in our header bidding capabilities, including through support of open-source wrapper technologies that eliminate exchange bias, expand support for major third-party header bidding technologies and additional formats to maximize access to inventory supply, and develop enhanced customer service capabilities.


• | Private Marketplace. We will continue to invest in our PMP solution, which we believe is well-positioned to take advantage of increased industry demand for PMP transactions.


• | Video. We plan to expand our video presence by continuing to drive growth with header bidding, new formats and stronger measurement and targeting capabilities, and providing monetization service for over-the-top ("OTT") and connected television content providers as they migrate increasingly to programmatic monetization of their advertising inventory.


• | Bringing Automation to Additional Media. Historically, our solution has focused on display advertising. We believe, however, that television and other analog and print media will eventually converge with existing digital channels, creating opportunities for us to expand our solution beyond digital media to analog and print media, such as television, radio, and magazines, as well as further expand in out-of-home media like billboards. We intend to extend our solution to track this convergence and support increasingly complex volumes of advertisements spanning multiple media. In addition to platform expansion, we intend to extend beyond our current capabilities for display, video, and engagement to other forms of advertising units as they may arise.

Technology and Development
To support our solution, we have developed globally distributed infrastructure hosted at data centers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia that run our proprietary software and process privacy-enabled user data, including analytics and decision-making algorithms, and store, manage, and process rules set by buyers and sellers and data about demographics, economics, timing, and preferences. Our hardware provides significant scale and is programmed for high-frequency, low-latency transactions. Its massive scale supports the volume, diversity, and complexity of buyers’ bids on sellers’ advertising inventory to increase market liquidity, and it achieves improved auction pricing using our machine-learning algorithms. This infrastructure is supported by a real-time data pipeline, a system that quickly moves volumes of data generated by our business into reporting and machine learning systems that allow usage both internally and by buyers and sellers. It also is supported by a 24-hour Network Operations Center, which provides failure protection by monitoring and rerouting traffic in the event of equipment failure or network performance issues between buyers and our marketplace.
Auction and security algorithms use matchmaking algorithms with both historical and real-time data to drive automated decision-making processes. Bid efficiency algorithms provide bid prediction (i.e., which buyers are most likely to bid on a given impression) and throttling (i.e., the volume of bid requests a given buyer can process), to improve infrastructure load and execute transactions in the most timely manner possible by only sending bid requests to those buyers of advertising inventory who can handle the volume and are likely to respond.    
Our core technology and development team is responsible for the design, development, operation, and maintenance of our platform. Our technology and development process is based on agile development methodologies and emphasizes frequent, iterative, and incremental development cycles. Within the technology and development team, we have several highly aligned, 
independent sub-teams that focus on particular features of our platform. Each of these sub-teams includes engineers, quality assurance specialists, and product developers responsible for the initial and ongoing development of each sub-team’s feature. In addition, the technology and development team includes our technical operations sub-team, which is responsible for the performance and capacity of our platform. While our sub-teams operate independently, the combined work is coordinated by our project management team, which manages dependencies and optimizes the schedule of the entire team towards common goals.
We believe that continued investment in our platform, including its technologies and functionalities, is critical to our success and long-term growth. We therefore expect technology and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in technology infrastructure to support an increased volume of advertising spending on our platform and international expansion, migrate some of our infrastructure to the cloud, and expand our engineering and technology teams to maintain and support our technology and development efforts. We also intend to invest in new and enhanced technologies and functionalities to enhance our platform and further automate our business processes with the goal of enhancing our future profitability.
Sales and Marketing
We market our solution to buyers and sellers through global direct sales teams that operate from various locations around the world. These teams leverage market knowledge and expertise to demonstrate the benefits of advertising automation and our solution to buyers and sellers. We deploy a professional services team with each seller integration to assist sellers in extracting value from our solution. Our buyer team focuses on the unique challenges and priorities of buyers and is separately managed in order to properly represent this important client group. We are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness, and driving advertising spend to our platform. To do so, we often present at industry conferences, create custom events, and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team advertises online, in print, and in other forms of media, creates case studies, sponsors research, writes whitepapers, publishes marketing collateral, generates blog posts, and undertakes client research studies.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive. Overall digital advertising spending is highly concentrated in a small number of very large companies that have their own inventory, including Google and Facebook, and increasingly Amazon, with which we compete for digital advertising inventory and demand. These companies are formidable competitors due to their huge resources and direct user relationships. Despite the dominance of large companies, there is still a large addressable market that is highly fragmented and includes many providers of transaction services with which we compete, including supply side platforms, or SSPs, and advertising exchanges. As we introduce new offerings, as our existing offerings evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may be subject to additional competition. There has been rapid evolution and consolidation in the advertising technology industry, and we expect these trends to continue, thereby increasing the capabilities and competitive posture of larger companies, particularly those that are already dominant in various ways, and enabling new or stronger competitors to emerge. There are many ways for buyers and sellers of digital advertising inventory to connect and transact, including directly and through many other exchanges, and advertising inventory buyers are increasingly demanding more transparency and lower transaction costs and establishing relationships directly with sellers of advertising inventory, which puts significant pressure on us. Our offering must remain competitive in terms of scope, ease of use, scalability, speed, price, inventory quality, brand security, customer service, and other technological features that help sellers monetize their inventory and buyers increase the return on their advertising investment. 
While our industry is evolving rapidly and becoming increasingly competitive, we believe that our solution enables us to compete favorably on the factors described above. However, competitive differentiation is difficult to achieve, both in terms of capabilities and in terms of client perception. We lack the scale of some of our competitors, which may have the ability to compete effectively with us by offering broader capabilities or more aggressive pricing. Other competitors with capabilities inferior to ours may nevertheless compete effectively with us if clients do not perceive, or value, what we believe to be our competitive advantages. 
To an increasing degree, SSPs and exchanges are becoming somewhat similar and less distinguishable in the services that they provide, and with the proliferation of header bidding, which increased competition for impressions, pricing has become a key competitive factor. In 2017, we continued to see a heightened level of competition on pricing sensitivity, which led us to implement buyer fee reductions in the first half of the year and ultimately to eliminate all our buy side transaction fees on November 1, 2017. 
Overall our revenue decreased 20% from $155.5 million in 2017 to $124.7 million in 2018, which reflects the impact of our buyer fee elimination, partially offset by growth in ad spend. Our overall take rate in 2018 declined to 12.6% compared to 18.5% in 2017 and 25.0% in 2016. We exited 2018 at approximately 13.6% compared to 11.6% at the end of 2017. Our exit take rate in December 2018 is higher due primarily to seller pricing improvements negotiated during the year. We believe this take rate puts us in a favorable competitive position in terms of pricing, but it is uncertain whether it represents a sustainable competitive advantage or if we can increase our transaction volume enough to compensate for lower prices. 
Our Team and Culture
Our team draws from a broad spectrum of experience, including data science, machine-learning algorithms, auctions, infrastructure, software development, and from experienced managers on the seller and buyer sides.
We focus heavily upon developing and maintaining a company culture that supports our goals. We strive to make our company an exciting place to work, not just a “job.” We reward team and individual excellence and constantly strive to build a stronger, more innovative team and a consistent culture across all our locations.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 409 full-time employees. In addition to the United States, we have personnel and operations in England, Canada, France, Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and Brazil. 
Our Intellectual Property
Our proprietary technologies are important and we rely upon trade secret, trademark, copyright, and patent laws in the United States and abroad to establish and protect our intellectual property and protect our proprietary technologies.
We have several issued patents and pending patent applications, some of which may ultimately be abandoned if we determine that the cost of prosecution or maintenance does not justify the utility of receiving the patent. None of these patents has been litigated and we are not licensing any of the patents, and we do not believe that any individual patent or patent application is material to our business. Their importance to our business is uncertain and there are no guarantees that any of the patents will serve as protection for our technology or market in the United States or any other country in which an application has been filed. 
We register certain domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We also rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks. We generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business, in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. We also use measures designed to control access to our technology and proprietary information. We view our trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets, which we believe differentiate us from our competitors.
Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, or any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property or technology, could harm our business, our ability to compete and our operating results.
Client Dynamics
While we serve many clients, certain buyers and sellers account for a large share of business transacted through our platform.
On the buy-side of our business, while demand for advertising inventory is diffuse, spending by advertisers on digital advertising inventory has historically been channeled through intermediaries, including principally advertising agencies and DSPs, both of which are important to us. We have generated a majority of our revenue through OMP, and most OMP inventory purchases are executed by a relatively small number of DSPs that have the bidding technologies, data assets, and client bases necessary to enable them to execute OMP purchases at scale on behalf of their clients. We have relationships with almost all of these major DSPs, but because there are relatively few of them, each of these relationships is important to us because it represents a source of demand that could be difficult for us to replace. Similarly, the majority of supply to date on our PMP product has been by a relatively small number of sellers. Creating new seller clients and expanding our business with existing seller clients is important to our growth, and the loss of any seller clients could adversely affect our PMP business. In addition, because large agencies often spend through multiple DSPs, new or enhanced agency relationships can result in increased spending on our platform by multiple DSPs, while a decrease in business or a decline in our relationship with a single agency can result in reduced spending by multiple DSPs. We are working to develop relationships directly with advertisers, to supplement their DSP and agency relationships and also to encourage them to influence their DSPs and agencies to route their spending through our platform. 
On the sell-side of our business, while we work with many clients, a relatively small number of them provide a large share of the unique user audiences accessible by buyers. In addition, most of the application providers that make inventory available through our platform utilize system development kits ("SDKs") and other proprietary technology of third parties, such as aggregators, and it is those third parties, not the application providers themselves, that contract with us to help monetize the inventory. Termination or diminution of our relationships with these third parties could result in a material reduction of the amount of mobile inventory available through our platform. We encourage application developers to use our own SDK when appropriate, but it is difficult to displace existing SDKs. 
Our contracts with buyers and sellers generally do not provide for any minimum volumes and may be terminated on relatively short notice. Buyer and seller needs and plans can change quickly, and buyers and sellers are free to terminate their arrangements with us or direct their spending and inventory to competing sources of inventory and demand, quickly and without penalty. Loss of a major buyer could result in a decrease of demand on our platform, and loss of a major seller could result in decrease of inventory available on our platform. Despite such losses, there could still be adequate demand and inventory supply on our platform to sustain and grow our revenue, so it is not necessarily the case that loss of a buyer or seller equates to loss of revenue. However, loss of unique inventory and loss of any demand could result directly in revenue loss. In addition, just as growth in the inventory strengthens buyer activity in a network effect, loss of substantial inventory or demand could degrade our marketplace. Loss of major DSP sources of demand could adversely affect bid density or pricing in our RTB auctions, and reduction in fees if we are not able to redirect inventory to other demand sources. Loss of important unique inventory could reduce fees from demand that cannot be shifted to other sellers. The number of large media buyers and sellers in the market is finite, and it could be difficult for us to replace the losses from any buyers or sellers whose relationships with us diminish or terminate.
Because of these factors, we seek to expand and diversify our client relationships. In particular, as part of our strategy to increase the volume of advertising inventory on our exchange, we are continuing relationships with aggregators of inventory and with large sources of supply that have their own monetization capabilities but also allow third parties to connect to their exchanges and bid on their inventory. These relationships represent additional risks in terms of inventory quality, transaction discrepancies, and collections, and may be less profitable because we may be required to compensate these partners or share the fees available for intermediaries in these transactions, and may incur higher serving costs relative to revenue. 
Geographic Scope of Our Operations
Our international operations and expansion plans expose us to various risks. International operations require significant investment in developing the technology infrastructure necessary to deliver our solution and establishing sales, delivery, support, and administrative capabilities in the countries where we operate. We face staffing challenges, including difficulty in recruiting, retaining, and managing a diverse and distributed workforce across time zones, cultures, and languages. We must also adapt our practices to satisfy local requirements and standards (including differing privacy requirements that are sometimes more stringent than in the U.S.), and manage the effects of global and regional recessions and economic and political instability. Transactions denominated in various non-U.S. currencies expose us to potentially unfavorable changes in exchange rates and added transaction costs. Foreign operations expose us to potentially adverse tax consequences in the United States and abroad and costs and restrictions affecting the repatriation of funds to the United States. For detailed information regarding our revenue and property and equipment, net by geographical region, see Note 4 and Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
User Reach 
It is not practicable to determine the exact number of unique users we reach because we do not collect personally identifiable information. In order to estimate our user reach, we start with data we track on devices we see through our platform in a given time period: for web browsers, we identify each combination of browser user agent and originating IP address, and for mobile application users, we identify unique device identifiers. The resulting aggregated total counts some devices more than once because the same device creates different user agent and IP address combinations by using different browsers to access the Internet and/or accessing the Internet from locations with different IP addresses. We therefore make assumptions about the amount of duplication, as well as assumptions about the average numbers of devices per person, which can vary by geography and over time, and apply these assumptions to estimate of the number of users we reach. Following this methodology, we estimate that we reach approximately one billion users globally through our platform. This figure depends upon our assumptions and is therefore inherently imprecise and may differ from third-party estimates of our reach.
Regulation
Behavioral or personalized advertising, or the use of data to draw inferences about a user’s interests and deliver relevant advertising to that user, has come under increasing scrutiny by legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory bodies in the United States and abroad that focus on consumer protection or data privacy. In particular, this scrutiny has focused on the use of technology (including "cookies") to collect or aggregate information about Internet users’ online browsing activity. Because we, and our clients, rely upon large volumes of such data, it is essential that we monitor developments in this area domestically and globally, and engage in responsible privacy practices, including providing consumers with notice of the types of data we collect and how we use that data to provide our services.
We provide this notice through our privacy policy, which can be found on our website at http://www.rubiconproject.com/privacy. As stated in our privacy policy, our technology platform does not collect information, such as name, address, or phone number, that can be used directly to identify a real person, and we take steps not to collect and store such information from any source. Instead, we rely on IP addresses, geo-location information, and persistent identifiers about Internet users and do not attempt 
to associate this data with other data that can be used to identify real people. This type of information is considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of future legislation or regulation. The definition of personal data varies by country, and continues to evolve in ways that may require us to adapt our practices to avoid violating laws or regulations related to the collection, storage, and use of consumer data. As a result, our technology platform and business practices must be assessed regularly in each country in which we do business.
There are also a number of specific laws and regulations governing the collection and use of certain types of consumer data relevant to our business. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), imposes restrictions on the collection and use of data about users of child-directed websites. To comply with COPPA, we have taken various steps to implement a system that: (i) flags seller-identified child-directed sites to buyers, (ii) limits advertisers’ ability to serve personalized advertisements on child-directed sites, (iii) helps limit the types of information that our advertisers have access to when placing advertisements on child-directed sites, and (iv) limits the data that we collect and use on such child-directed sites.
The use of and transfer of personal data in EU member states is currently governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"). The GDPR sets out higher potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, as well as a greater compliance burden for us in the course of delivering our solution in Europe. Among other requirements, the GDPR obligates companies that process large amounts of personal data about EU residents to implement a number of formal processes and policies for reviewing and documenting the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use of all new products, technologies, or types of data. Further, the European Union is expected to replace the EU ePrivacy Directive governing the use of technologies to collect consumer information with the ePrivacy Regulation. Current drafts of the ePrivacy Regulation propose burdensome requirements around obtaining consent, and impose fines for violations that are materially higher than those imposed under the ePrivacy Directive.
The GDPR also prohibits the transfer of personal data of EU subjects outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), unless the party exporting the data from the EU implements a compliance mechanism designed to ensure that the receiving party will adequately protect such data. We have relied on certain compliance measures that are currently subject to legal challenge, and which directly subject us to regulatory enforcement by data protection authorities located in the European Union and the United States. By relying on these compliance measures, we risk becoming the subject of regulatory investigations in any of the individual jurisdictions in which we operate. Each such investigation could cost us significant time and resources, and could potentially result in fines, criminal prosecution, or other penalties. Further, to the extent any of the legal challenges to these compliance measures are successful, this could invalidate our approach to data export from the EEA. It may take us significant time, resources, and effort to restructure our business and/or rely on another legally sufficient compliance measure. 
The UK's decision to leave the European Union may add cost and complexity to our compliance efforts. The UK is an important geography for us. If UK and EU privacy and data protection laws and regulations diverge, we will be required to implement alternative EU compliance measures and adapt separately to any new UK requirements.
Additionally, our compliance with our privacy policies and our general consumer privacy practices are also subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission, which may bring enforcement actions to challenge allegedly unfair and deceptive trade practices, including the violation of privacy policies and representations therein. Certain State Attorneys General may also bring enforcement actions based on comparable state laws or federal laws that permit state-level enforcement. Outside of the United States, our privacy and data practices are subject to regulation by data protection authorities and other regulators in the countries in which we do business.
Beyond laws and regulations, we are also members of self-regulatory bodies that impose additional requirements related to the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer data, including the Internet Advertising Bureau ("IAB"), the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Network Advertising Initiative, and the Europe Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance. Under the requirements of these self-regulatory bodies, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice via our privacy policy about our use of cookies and other technologies to collect consumer data, and of our collection and use of consumer data to deliver personalized advertisements. We also allow consumers to opt-out from the use of data we collect for purposes of behavioral advertising through a mechanism on our website, linked through our privacy policy as well as through portals maintained by some of these self-regulatory bodies. Some of these self-regulatory bodies have the ability to discipline members or participants, which could result in fines, penalties, and/or public censure (which could in turn cause reputational harm). Additionally, some of these self-regulatory bodies might refer violations of their requirements to the Federal Trade Commission or other regulatory bodies.
Business Seasonality
Our advertising spend, revenue, cash flow from operations, Adjusted EBITDA, operating results, and other key operating and financial measures may vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of buyer spending. For example, many buyers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased 
holiday purchasing. We expect our revenue, cash flow, operating results and other key operating and financial measures to fluctuate based on seasonal factors from period to period and expect these measures to be higher in the fourth quarters than in prior quarters.
Working Capital Requirements
Our revenue is generated from advertising spend transacted on our platform using our technology solution. Generally, we invoice and collect from buyers the full purchase price for impressions they have purchased, retain our fees, and remit the balance to sellers. We attempt to coordinate collections from our buyers so as to fund our payment obligations to our sellers. However, in some cases, we may be required to pay sellers for impressions delivered before we have collected, or even if we are unable to collect, from the buyer of those impressions. There can be no assurances that we will not experience bad debt in the future. Any such write-offs for bad debt could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations for the periods in which the write-offs occur. In addition, growth and increased competitive pressure in the digital advertising industry are causing brand spenders to become more demanding, resulting in overall increased focus by all industry participants on pricing, transparency, and cash and collection cycles. Some buyers have experienced financial pressures that have motivated them to challenge some details of our invoices or to slow the timing of their payments to us. If buyers slow their payments to us or our cash collections are significantly diminished as a result of these dynamics, our revenue and/or cash flow could be adversely affected and we may need to use working capital to fund our accounts payable pending collection from buyers. This may result in additional cash expenditures and cause us to forgo or defer other more productive uses of that working capital.
