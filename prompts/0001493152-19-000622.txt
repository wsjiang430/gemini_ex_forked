ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
Corporate Structure
 
Stem Holdings, Inc. was organized on June 7, 2016 as a Nevada corporation under Chapter 78 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. The Company’s principal office is located at 7777 Glades Road, Suite 203, Boca Raton, FL 33434. The Company has six subsidiaries, Stem Group Oklahoma, Inc., Opco LLC, Stem Holdings, Florida, Inc., Stem Holdings Oregon, Inc. and Stem Holdings, IP Inc. and Stem Agri, LLC
 
Overview of the Business
 
The Company was formed to purchase, lease and improve certain real estate properties (the “Properties”), initially in the State of Oregon, which are or will be utilized as either state-licensed cannabis selling retail establishments or state-licensed cannabis growing facilities. While the Company currently operates primarily as a real estate holding company, it intends in the future to engage in direct operations with respect to its properties and activities other than the leasing of properties, funding of capital improvements and administration of its leases and provision of financing to certain lessees.
 
The initial business of the Company was detailed in a multiparty agreement dated as of August 4, 2016, as revised on October 24, 2016 (“Multiparty Agreement”), by and among the Company and the following entities, which are affiliates of the founders of the Company: Oregon Acquisitions, JV LLC, Gated Oregon Holdings LLC, Kind Care Holdings, LLC, and Never Again Real Estate, LLC. The Multiparty Agreement detailed the following:
 

● | the relationships between the various founders of the Company and their respective affiliated entities, as well as the initial share ownership in the Company; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | certain proposed real estate transactions to be undertaken by the Company together with the business terms and structures related to these transactions;

● | the rental terms and lessees for the properties identified by the parties; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the terms of a right of first refusal with respect to the acquisition of additional properties; 
● | certain terms related to additional investment in the Company by the founders and the terms and conditions thereof; and 
● | the terms and conditions of the potential acquisition of the operating companies and three other currently operating companies by the Company under specified circumstances. 

 
The Multiparty Agreement contemplated that the initial Properties owned by the Company and identified in the Multiparty Agreement (and as further described below) would be leased by the Company to subsidiaries of OpCo Holdings, Inc. (“OpCo”). Opco is a company formed in 2016 by the Company’s founders and their affiliates for the purpose of operating multiple cannabis-related businesses initially in the State of Oregon, and the Company’s founders and their affiliated entities directly and indirectly collectively own approximately 24.06% of the outstanding stock of Opco.
 
The following is an overview of acquisitions completed by the Company: 
 
In September 2016, the Company entered into a 10-year lease with respect to certain property located in Springfield, OR (the “42nd Street Property”) with the landlord that commenced in November 2016. The lease requires the Company to pay a base rental fee of $7,033 plus an additional estimated $315 per month in real estate taxes in which the base rental fee escalates each year by approximately 2%. All taxes (including reconciling real estate taxes), maintenance and utilities are included at the end of each year as a one-time payment. In addition, the Company also remitted $14,000 for a security deposit to the landlord. In July 2017, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the 42nd Street Property. The lease agreement is for a term of ten years and a monthly rent obligation of $64,640, subject to annual increases of 3% per year plus an amount for additional rent based on final buildout costs incurred by the Company. The lease is a double net lease with maintenance and real property taxes to be paid by the Tenant and insurance costs paid by the Company. Rent payments have not yet commenced. The Company has treated tenancy for the period prior to rent commencement as a free rental period for accounting purposes.
 
On November 1, 2016, the Company acquired certain property located in Eugene, OR (the “Willamette Property”) for a total cash purchase price plus closing costs of approximately $918,000. In July 2017, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with a marijuana dispensary to move into the Willamette Property. The lease agreement is for a base term of ten years (see note below) and a monthly rent obligation of $13,800, subject to annual increases of 3% per year, plus an amount for additional rent based on final buildout costs incurred by the Company. The lease is a double net lease with maintenance and real property taxes to be paid by the Tenant and insurance costs paid by the Company. The Company provided the tenant with one month of free rent. Upon the expiration of the term of ten years, the Lessee has the option to renew the lease agreement for one five-year term, on the same terms as provided in the lease agreement. On February 28, 2018, the Company executed a $550,000 mortgage payable on the Willamette property to acquire additional funds. The mortgage bears interest at 15% per annum. Monthly interest only payments began March 1, 2018 and continue each month thereafter until paid. The entire unpaid balance is due on March 1, 2020, the maturity date of the mortgage, and is secured by the underlying property. The mortgage terms do not allow participations by the lender in either the appreciation in the fair value of the mortgaged real estate project or the results of operations of the mortgaged real estate project. For the nine months ended June 30, 2018, interest expense related to this mortgage amounted to $27,500. The note has been cross guaranteed by the CEO and Director of the Company.
 
On February 6, 2017, the Company acquired certain real property located at 7827 SE Powell Blvd, Portland, OR 97206 (the “Powell Property”) for a total purchase price plus closing costs of approximately $656,498. In July 2017, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the Powell Property. The lease agreement is for a term of ten years and a monthly rent obligation of $6,523, subject to annual increases of 3% per year. Maintenance and real property taxes shall be paid by the Tenant and insurance paid by the Company. Additional rents will be added to pay landlord back for tenant improvements by the end of the first term of the lease, payments will include annual interest at 12% compounded monthly. Rent payments have not yet commenced. The Company has treated tenancy for the period prior to rent commencement as a free rental period for accounting purposes. Upon the expiration of the term of ten years, the Lessee has the option to renew the lease agreement for five-year term, on the same terms as provided in the lease agreement. On April 4, 2018, the Company executed a $314,000 mortgage payable on the Powell property to acquire additional funds. The mortgage bears interest at 15% per annum. Monthly interest only payments began May 1, 2018 and continue each month thereafter until paid. The entire unpaid balance is due on April 1, 2020, the maturity date of the mortgage, and is secured by the underlying property. The mortgage terms do not allow participations by the lender in either the appreciation in the fair value of the mortgaged real estate project or the results of operations of the mortgaged real estate project. The note has been cross guaranteed by the CEO and Director of the Company.

On January 2018 the Company consummated a “Contract for Sale” for a Farm Property in Mulino OR (the “Mulino Property”). The purchase price was $1,700,000 which was reduced by a rental credit of approximately $135,000 which is equivalent to nine months’ rent at $15,000 a month and an additional credit of $9,500 for additional work done on the property. In connection with the purchase of the property, the Company made a cash payment as down payment plus payment of closing costs in the amount of $370,637 and issued a promissory note in the amount of $1,200,000 with a maturity of January 2020. The Company will pay monthly installments of principal and interest (at a rate of 2% per annum) in the amount of $13,500, commencing in July 2018 through the maturity date (January 2020), at which time the entire unpaid principal balance and any remaining accrued interest shall be due and payable in full. The note is secured by a deed of trust on the property.
 
The Company has committed to improve the aforementioned properties which are leased to third parties. These commitments will require an additional cash outlay in the amount of approximately $300,000.
 
Investments in Subsidiaries. In April 2018, the Company received a 37.5% interest in NVD RE Corp. (“NVD”) upon its issuance to NVD of a commitment to contribute $1.275 million to NVD. As of September 30, 2018, the Company had fully funded its commitment and has recorded the amount as its investment in equity method investee on the Company’s balance sheet. NVD used the funds provided to date by the Company to acquire an under- construction cannabis indoor grow building and to continue the buildout of the property. The Company has no further commitment to fund the entity beyond its initial equity purchase commitment. NVD intends to lease the property upon its buildout completion to an entity that the Company expects to acquire sometime in Fiscal 2019 within its newly formed Opco, LLC subsidiary. Should the Company complete that acquisition it will no longer hold 100% of the membership interests in Opco, LLC, however, the NVD tenant is in the process of transferring 50% of its cannabis cultivation and processing license to Opco, LLC which would then be wholly owned by Stem. For the period from acquisition through September 30, 2018, NVD had only minimal operations, which were not apportioned to these financials statements as of September 30, 2018 due to immateriality.
 
Potential Acquisitions
 
In July 2018, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (“MIPA1”) to acquire 50% of the membership interests in an entity that is currently dormant, but was previously issued certain citrus licenses in the state of Florida that allow the entity to apply for licenses to produce and sell cannabis for medical purposes in the state of Florida in exchange for $500,000 in cash paid at closing of signing the MIPA1 plus a promissory note in the amount of $1 million, payable upon the entity obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct cannabis operations in the state of Florida. In the event that the licenses are not granted, the transaction unwinds in full, with return of the funds advanced, cancellation of the promissory note and return of the membership interest. As of September 30, 2018 and the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the licenses had not yet been granted to the entity. Because closing is outside the control of both the Company as buyer and the seller of the interests, this investment was designated in our financial statements as “Due from affiliate” as of September 30, 2018.
 
In September 2018, the Company entered into Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (“MIPA2”) to acquire 50% of the membership interests in an entity that intends to engage in the production and sale of cannabis in the state of Nevada for $750,000. The signing of the membership interest required the Company to deposit $375,000 into an escrow account held by an attorney and in addition, upon the entity being transferred the appropriate licenses by the state and local authorities, the Company must fund the remaining amounts. Under the MIPA2, closing does not occur in full until the licenses are issued by the state and local authorities. In the event that the licenses are not tranferred, the transaction unwinds in full, with return of the funds advanced and return of the membership interest. As of September 30, 2018 and the date of filing of this Form 10-K, the licenses had not yet been transferred to the entity. Because closing is outside the control of both the Company as buyer and the seller of the interests, this investment was designated in our financial statements as “Due from affiliate” as of September 30, 2018.

 
In 2018, the Company began negotiations toward closing on an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) to acquire the assets and certain liabilities of an entity that engages in the production and sale of cannabis in the state of Oregon. The APA currently requires the Company to acquire those assets and assume those liabilities and remit payment of $350,000 in cash, a promissory note in the amount of $400,000 and 1,931,506 shares of stock of the Company, which were issued in October 2018 and are held by an attorney in escrow prior to closing. Closing of the agreement is dependent upon finalizing negotiations on the APA and obtaining the transfer of licenses required in order for the Company to take control of the entity under the laws of the state of Oregon. Unwinding of the agreement, including cancellation of shares issued, will occur if the APA is not successfully closed.
 
Significant Events and Milestones Under Multiparty Agreement
 
Per the terms of the Multiparty Agreement, once the Company has invested an aggregate of $10 million in real estate properties (“Milestone 1”), the Company will be obligated to purchase two additional specified properties from parties to the Multiparty Agreement for aggregate consideration of $1,000,000 within ninety (90) days of achieving Milestone 1. This milestone was met in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
 
A right of first refusal granted to the Company to acquire each new parcel of real property identified by various parties to the Multiparty Agreement as suitable for production or retail of cannabis in the State of Oregon. This right of first refusal shall remain in effect so long as the Company has invested at least an aggregate of $8 million in real properties by January 30, 2019 and has invested at least an aggregate of $13 million in real properties by January 30, 2020. Upon reaching Milestone 3, the Company becomes obligated to purchase another property and issue stock to the seller in the amount of 20% of the purchase price plus buildout funded by the seller. Subsequent to September 30, 2018, the Company determined that Milestone 2 and Milestone 3 had been met.
 
In November 2018, the Company issued 457,191 shares of its common stock in satisfaction of the commitment noted above and is currently in negotiations with the seller of the property to fund the acquisition of the property in a combination of cash and notes, in the amount of approximately $4.395 million.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the achievement of the aforementioned milestones with respect to the continuation of the right of first refusal will be excused if aggregate rental income from all Company-owned properties does not meet the following criteria:
 

(i) First Quarter Achievement Threshold (“FQAT”) 
------------------------------------------------------
 | ● | $1.2 million (annualized) during any calendar quarter, commencing on or after October 1, 2017; 
 | ● | Right of first refusal may be terminated within 12 months following the last day of the quarter in which the FQAT is met; 
 | ● | Stem may revive the right of first refusal by investing an additional $5 million into additional real properties by the last day of the 12-month period. 
(ii) Second Quarter Achievement Threshold (“SQAT”) 
 | ● | $3.2 million (annualized) during any calendar quarter, commencing on or after January 1, 2019; 
 | ● | Right of first refusal may be terminated within 12 months following the last day of the quarter in which the SQAT is met; and 
 | ● | Stem may revive the right of first refusal by investing an aggregate of $8 million into additional real properties by the last day of the 12-month period. 
(iii) Third Quarter Achievement Threshold (“TQAT”) 
 | ● | $5 million (annualized) during any calendar quarter, commencing on or after June 1, 2019; 
 | ● | Right of first refusal may be terminated within 12 months following the last day of the quarter in which the TQAT is met; and 
 | ● | Stem may revive the right of first refusal by investing an aggregate of $13 million into additional real properties by the last day of the 12-month period. 

 
Under the Multi-party Agreement, it was initially assumed that each of the properties owned or leased by the Company would be leased to subsidiaries of Opco Holdings. The Company was not initially directly involved in the operation of these properties or in the growing or sale of cannabis.
 
Each of the subsidiaries of Opco Holdings is obligated to purchase Preferred Shares under certain specified terms and conditions:
 
Obligation to Purchase Preferred Shares
 
After the Company invests an aggregate of $13 million in real properties, but before the Company is legally able to engage in the operating of the properties, all subsidiaries of Opco Holdings are required by the Multiparty Agreement to allocate an amount equal to at least 50% of its post-tax, net operating income to purchase Preferred Shares on the following terms:

(a) | Redeemable 20 years after issuance; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Annual dividend of 3%; 
(c) | Convertible into Common Shares at the higher of: 
 | (i) | $10 per Common Share (adjusted for share exchange, reclassification, combination, dividend, split, or similar event); or 
 | (ii) | Average closing price of Common Shares for the 20 trading days prior to conversion date; and 
(d) | Such other preferences, rights, privileges, and limitations upon which the parties may mutually agree. 

 
As of the date of this filing, the Company has determined that this provision is currently not operative, as certain of the Opco entities have only recently received their licenses to become operational.
 
Company purchase of Opco businesses
 
As long as the Company has fully satisfied all of its obligations and milestones pursuant to the Multiparty Agreement, the Company will have the obligation to acquire the business operations of Opco Holdings and its subsidiaries, and Oregon Acquisitions, Gated Oregon and Kind Care shall each have the obligation to sell such operations, within a reasonable time after the Company receives a legal opinion that the operation of the Opco marijuana businesses in the State of Oregon by Stem will not violate any federal or state laws. However, the Company has no reason to believe that a change in federal law is forthcoming or likely either in the near term or long term, and accordingly there is no assurance that such a purchase will occur.
 
The Company is currently in negotiations to amend the multi-party agreement to remove the requirement for the US Government to remove cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and to accelerate the merger of the Opco entities into the Company. This will only take place if the existing Opco’s remain state compliant.

Principal Products and Markets
 
The Company’s principal operations have historically related to the leasing of properties, funding of capital, tenant improvements and administration of its leases and provision of financing to certain lessees, engaged in the production and sale of cannabis. While the Company currently operates primarily as a real estate holding company, it intends in the future to engage in direct operations, primarily the production and sale of cannabis in states where it is legal to do so, with respect to its properties and activities other than the leasing of properties, funding of capital improvements and administration of its leases and provision of financing to certain lessees. Historically, the Company’s principal market has been in the State of Oregon, but it is now engaged in expansion into other markets where sale of marijuana is legal, including Nevada and Oklahoma.
Production and Sales
 
The Company’s business requires that it possess or be in a position to access specialized knowledge and expertise regarding the state-licensed cannabis industry and those persons and entities who are involved in the industry. The Company believes that its management has such specialized expertise and experience, and the Company retains legal counsel that has recognized expertise in the industry. The Company does not believe that any aspect of its business is either: (i) cyclical or seasonal; or (ii) dependent on any particular franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name. The Company has not identified any specific environmental protection issues which will affect its business. The Company does not own identifiable intangible properties.
 
The Company is largely dependent on the financial solvency of its lessees and revenues could be adversely affected in a material way should any lessee not be able to maintain lease payments on a regular or consistent manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company believes that no property is so identified with a particular tenant that the Company could not identify and obtain a successor lessee in the event of any default by a tenant in the payment of rent. Given that the Company has not achieved a critical mass of properties, the default by any single tenant will have a material impact on the Company’s finances for an indeterminate period of time.
 
The Company does not believe that its operations are dependent on any factors within the general economy. However, any material changes in either U.S. federal law enforcement priorities or the law of the State of Oregon, Nevada and Oklahoma or other states where the Company operates affecting the cultivation and sale of cannabis could have a material impact on the Company’s business, particularly since the growth, marketing, sale, and use of marijuana is illegal under federal law.
 
Company Funding
 
Private Placement Transactions
 
The Company has sold shares of its common stock in private placement transactions under the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and certain exemptions of the laws of the jurisdictions where any offering is made. In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company raised gross proceeds of approximately $6,560,000 and $4,529,000, respectively.
 
The securities issued in the above-mentioned transactions were issued in connection with private placements exempt from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the terms of Section 4(2) of that Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D. Investors who acquired shares of our common stock in the foregoing private placement transactions were all accredited investors and were required to complete, execute and deliver a subscription agreement and related documentation, which included customary representations and warranties, certain covenants and restrictions and indemnification provisions.

Patch Transaction
 
In November 2016, the Company entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with Patch International Inc. (“Patch”), a company incorporated in the Province of Alberta, Canada, whereby the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Patch by way of a plan of arrangement under Section 193 of the ABCA (the “Arrangement”). In order to close the transaction, Patch was required to submit the Arrangement for approval to the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench (the final order was granted on January 20, 2017), hold a general meeting of its shareholders and have the shareholders vote to approve the arrangement (which took place on January 19, 2017), and certain other customary requirements. As of the time of the Arrangement Agreement, Patch did not have any operations and was considered a dormant entity.
 
On January 20, 2017, the Company completed the Arrangement and issued 1,048,782 Common Shares to the former shareholders of Patch. The aggregate cash held by Patch at the closing was approximately $2,400,000, after accounting for buyout payments made to Patch shareholders who declined to participate in the transaction.


Convertible Promissory Notes and Mortgages
 
In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company entered into mortgages on two existing properties. The mortgages have a principal amount of $864,000 with maturity dates ranging between March and April 2020. The net proceeds received by these mortgages by the Company was approximately $739,000.
 
In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company entered into convertible promissory notes with accredited investors and received gross proceeds of $2,325,000. The Convertible notes mature between March and June 2019, but were fully converted in October and November 2018.
 
Short Term Financing
 
In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company entered into two separate promissory notes each for $100,000 with maturity dates in March 2018. One of the notes was repaid in full at maturity, the other note had its maturity date extended to March 2019, its interest rate reduced and had added a conversion feature.


In September 2018, in the course of one of the convertible note offerings detailed above, the Company received an advance of $168,000 in contemplation of an investment into the offering. Notwithstanding, as of September 30, 2018 and the date of this report, the parties have been unable to come to an agreement on the terms of the investment. The amount tendered has therefore been treated as an undocumented, non-interest bearing advance to the Company.
 
CD Special Warrant Offering
 
On December 27, 2018, the Company entered into an Agency Agreement with respect to a private offering of up to 10,000 special warrants of the Company (the “CD Special Warrants”) for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $10,000,000 (in Canadian funds, denoted herein as “C”) (the “Offering”). In addition, on December 27, 2018, the Company closed the first tranche of the Offering consisting of 3,121 CD Special Warrants at a price of C$1,000 per CD Special Warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of C$3,121,000.
 
Each CD Special Warrant will be exchanged (with no further action on the part of the holder thereof and for no further consideration) for one convertible debenture unit of the Company (a “Convertible Debenture Unit”), on the earlier of: (i) the third business day after the date on which both (A) a receipt (the “Receipt”) for a (final) prospectus (the “Qualification Prospectus”) qualifying the distribution of the Convertible Debentures (as defined below) and Warrants (as defined below) issuable upon exercise of the CD Special Warrants has been issued by the applicable securities regulatory authorities in the Canadian jurisdictions in which purchasers of the CD Special Warrants are resident (the “Canadian Jurisdictions”), and (B) a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) registering the resale of the common shares underlying the Convertible Debentures and Warrants has been declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Registration”); and (ii) the date that is six months following the closing of the Offering. The Company has also provided certain registration rights to purchasers of the CD Special Warrants.

Each Convertible Debenture Unit is comprised of C$1,000 principal amount 8.0% senior unsecured convertible debenture (each, a “Convertible Debenture”) of the Company and 167 common share purchase warrants of the Company (each, a “Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the Company (each, a “Warrant Share”) at an exercise price of C$3.90 per Warrant Share for a period of 24 months following the closing of the Offering.
 
The Company has agreed to use its best efforts to obtain the Receipt and Registration within six months following the closing of the Offering. In the event that the Receipt and Registration have not been obtained on or before 5:00 p.m. (PST) on the date that is 120 days following the closing of the Offering, each unexercised CD Special Warrant will thereafter entitle the holder thereof to receive, upon the exercise thereof and at no additional cost, 1.05 Convertible Debenture Units per CD Special Warrant (instead of 1.0 Convertible Debenture Unit per CD Special Warrant). Until the Receipt and Registration have been obtained, securities issued in connection with the Offering (including any underlying securities issued upon conversion or exercise thereof) will be subject to a 6-month hold period from the date of issue.
 
The brokered portion of the Offering (C$2,247,000) was completed by a syndicate of agents (collectively, the “Agents”). The Company paid the Agents a cash commission equal to 7.0% of the gross proceeds raised in the first tranche of the brokered portion of the Offering. As additional consideration, the Company issued the Agents such number of non-transferable broker convertible debenture special warrants (the “Broker CD Special Warrants”) as is equal to 7.0% of the number of CD Special Warrants sold under the first tranche of the brokered portion of the Offering. Each Broker CD Special Warrant shall be exchanged, on the same terms as the CD Special Warrants, into broker warrants of the Company (the “Broker Warrants”). Each Broker Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one Convertible Debenture Unit at an exercise price of C$1,000, until the date that is 24 months from the closing date of the Offering. The distribution of the Broker Warrants issuable upon the exchange of the Broker CD Special Warrants shall also be qualified under the Qualification Prospectus and the resale of the common shares underlying the Broker Warrants will be registered under the Registration Statement. The Company also paid the lead agent a corporate finance fee equal to C$100,000, payable as to C$50,000 in cash and as to $50,000 in common shares of the Company at a price per share of C$3.00.
 
The net proceeds of the Offering will be used to for expansion initiatives and general corporate purposes.
 
The issuance of the securities was made in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for the offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering, Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, Regulation S, in Canada to “accredited investors” within the meaning of National Instrument 45-106 and other exempt purchasers in each province of Canada, except Quebec, and/or outside Canada and the United States on a basis which does not require the qualification or registration. The securities being offered have not been, nor will they be, registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements. This Form 8-K will not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor will there be any sale of the securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2018, the Company had ten (10) employees, some of whom devote their full time to the Company’s operations. The Company intends to increase staff as warranted by its operations and market conditions. Three employees have an employment agreement. No employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
