ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, pursuant to the Merger, we acquired our primary operating subsidiary Coeptis Therapeutics, Inc. Since prior to the Merger the Company was a shell company, the business description below is a description of the Company’s business based on our subsidiaries’ operations.
 
Company History
 
General.    We were originally incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on November 27, 2018, under the name Bull Horn Holdings Corp. On October 27, 2022, Bull Horn Holdings Corp. domesticated from the British Virgin Islands to the State of Delaware. On October 28, 2022, in connection with the closing of the Merger, we changed our corporate name from Bull Horn Holdings Corp. to “Coeptis Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.”
The Merger Transaction. On October 28, 2022, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bull Horn Holdings Corp., merged with and into Coeptis Therapeutics, Inc., with Coeptis Therapeutics, Inc. as the surviving corporation of the Merger. As a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of Coeptis Therapeutics, Inc., which we now continue to operate as our wholly owned subsidiary.
About the Company’s Subsidiaries. We are now a holding company that currently operates through our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries Coeptis Therapeutics, Inc., Coeptis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Coeptis Pharmaceuticals, LLC.
 
Our current business model is designed around furthering the development of our current product portfolio. We are continually exploring partnership opportunities with companies that have novel therapies in various stages of development or companies with technologies that improve the way that drugs are delivered to patients. We seek the best strategic relationships, which relationships could include in-license agreements, out-license agreements, co-development arrangements and other strategic partnerships in new and exciting therapeutic areas such as auto-immune disease and oncology.
 
Collaborations for Product Development — Research and Development
 
CD38 Therapeutic and Diagnostic; VyGen Bio, Inc.
 
In May 2021, we entered into two exclusive option agreements (the “CD38 Agreements”) relating to separate technologies (described below) designed to improve the treatment of CD38-related cancers (e.g., multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia) with VyGen-Bio, Inc. (“Vy-Gen”), a majority-owned subsidiary of Vycellix, Inc., a Tampa, Florida-based private, immune-centric discovery life science company focused on the development of transformational platform technologies to enhance and optimize next-generation cell and gene-based therapies, including T cell and Natural Killer (NK) cell-based cancer therapies. In August 2021, we exercised those two options and acquired a 50% ownership interest in such technologies, with the ownership interest scalable down to 20% under certain circumstances. In December 2021, we completed our purchase of the 50% ownership interest in the CD38-Diagnostic and adjusted the downward adjustment percentage for the CD38-GEAR-NK product candidate to 25%.
 
The CD38 Agreements relate to two separate Vy-Gen drug product candidates, as follows:
 

- | CD38-GEAR-NK. This Vy-Gen drug product candidate is designed to protect CD38+ NK cells from destruction by anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs. CD38-GEAR-NK is an autologous, NK cell-based therapeutic that is derived from a patient’s own cells and gene-edited to enable combination therapy with anti-CD38 mAbs. We believe CD38-GEAR-NK possesses the potential to minimize the risks and side effects from CD38-positive NK cell fratricide. While third party license or collaboration agreements are not required in order for Vy-Gen to develop the product to commercial use, potential strategic relationships will be considered on an ongoing basis as a potential strategy. No licenses or collaborations are currently being actively pursued.

 | Market Opportunity. We believe CD38-GEAR-NK could potentially revolutionize how CD38-related cancers are treated, by protecting CD38+ NK cells from destruction by anti-CD38 mAbs, thereby promoting the opportunity to improve the treatment of CD38-related cancers, including multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Multiple myeloma is expected to be the first cancer indication targeted with CD38-GEAR-NK. Our intent is to seek regulatory approval in the 8 major markets comprised of the United States, the UK, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, China, and Japan. The total multiple myeloma market size in these 8 countries was $16.27 billion in 2019 and is expected to increase modestly through 2030, according to DelveInsight. 
 | GEAR-NK Product Plan Overview. GEAR-NK is an autologous, gene-edited, natural killer cell-based therapeutic development platform that allows for modified NK cells to be co-administered with targeted mAbs, which, in the absence of the GEAR-NK, would otherwise be neutralized by mAb therapy. GEAR-NK is a pre-clinical in vitro proof-of-concept product with in vivo evaluations planned for 2023. Vy-Gen is actively engaged in the research and development of GEAR-NK, and through the joint steering committee, we are assessing market opportunities, intellectual property protection and potential regulatory strategy. No human clinical trials have been conducted for GEAR-NK but are planned for 2024. 
- | CD38-Diagnostic. This Vy-Gen drug product candidate is an in vitro diagnostic tool to analyze if cancer patients might be appropriate candidates for anti-CD38 mAb therapy. CD38-Diagnostic is an in vitro screening tool that is intended to provide the ability to pre-determine which cancer patients are most likely to benefit from targeted anti-CD38 mAb therapies, either as monotherapy or in combination with CD38-GEAR-NK. Our management believes that CD38-Diagnostic also has the potential to develop as a platform technology beyond CD38, including to identify patients likely to benefit for broad range of mAb therapies across myriad indications. CD38-Diagnostic is a discovery-stage product that is advancing towards pre-clinical activities. Vy-Gen is actively engaged in the research and development of CD38-Diagnostic, and through the joint steering committee, and we are assessing market opportunities, intellectual property protection and potential regulatory strategy are all areas of focus. No human clinical trials have been conducted for CD38-Diagnostic as the clinical study requirements are not yet defined. 
 | Market Opportunity. We believe CD38-Diagnostic provides opportunity to make more cost-effective medical decisions for the treatment of B cell malignancies with high CD38 expression, including multiple myeloma, which may help to avoid unnecessary administration of anti-CD38 therapies. CD38-Diagnostic is anticipated to reduce the number of patients that are subjected to ineffective therapy and to potentially result in significant savings to healthcare systems. 
 | CD38-Diagnostic is viewed as a potential companion diagnostic for determining patient suitability and likelihood of positive treatment outcomes for CD38-GEAR-NK and/or CD38 monoclonal antibody therapies. 

 
In May 2021, we made initial payments totaling $750,000 under the CD38 Agreements, to acquire the exclusive options to acquire co-development rights with respect to CD38-GEAR-NK and CD38-Diagnostic. On August 15, 2021, we entered into amendments to each of the CD038 Agreements. In connection with the two amendments, we delivered to VyGen promissory notes aggregating $3,250,000 with maturity dates of December 31, 2021, and made a cash payment of $1,000,000, upon which cash payment we exercised the two definitive option purchase agreements. In December 2021, we completed our payment obligations to secure our rights to 50% of the net revenue stream related to the CD38-Diagnostic, and also entered into an amendment of the CD038-GEAR-NK promissory note to extend the maturity date to March 31, 2022 (which date was subsequently extended to September 30, 2022) and to increase the scalable downward adjustment percentage for the CD38-GEAR-NK product candidate to 25%. Pursuant to the CD038-GEAR-NK amendment and subsequent extension, if the promissory note is timely paid by September 30, 2022, we will maintain its rights to 50% of the net revenue stream related to the CD38-GEAR-NK product candidate, and if the CD38-GEAR-NK promissory note is not timely paid by September 30, 2022, our rights with respect to CD38-GEAR-NK will automatically be reduced to 25% and the promissory note will be automatically cancelled and will no longer be due or payable. Details of the two August amendments and the December amendment are summarized in the amendments attached at Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated August 19, 2021, and Exhibit 4.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 27, 2021.

In connection with the Vy-Gen relationship and the Company’s rights in respect of the two product candidates described above, in December 2021 we entered into a co-development and steering committee agreement with Vy-Gen. The co-development and steering committee agreement provides for the governance and economic agreements between the Company and Vy-Gen related of the development of the two Vy-Gen drug product candidates and the revenue sharing related thereto, including each company having a 50% representation on the steering committee and each company receiving 50% of the net revenues related to the Vy-Gen product candidates (scalable downward to 25% for the CD38-GEAR-NK as described above). Related to the joint development, under the direction of the joint steering committee, we are currently assessing market opportunities, intellectual property protection and potential regulatory strategies for the CD38 Assets, and VyGen is overseeing the development activities being conducted through the scientists at Karolinska Institute. Details of the co-development and steering committee agreement are summarized in the agreement attached as Exhibit 4.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 27, 2021.
 
CAR-T Technologies; University of Pittsburgh
 
The Option:    In April 2022, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with the University of Pittsburgh to allow us to have an opportunity to evaluate certain intellectual property and patent rights to the following three CAR-T technologies: (i) mSA2 affinity-enhanced biotin-binding CAR, (ii) universal self-labeling SynNotch and CARs for programable antigen-targeting, and (iii) conditional control of universal CAR-T cells through stimulus-reactive adaptors. We paid the University of Pittsburgh a non-refundable $5,000 fee for the exclusive option rights to the three CAR-T technologies. As described below, we have exercised its option and entered into a license agreement with respect to universal self-labeling SynNotch and CARs for programable antigen-targeting. The other two technologies currently remain part of the option agreement.
The CAR-T License:    On August 31, 2022, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Pittsburgh for certain intellectual property rights related to the universal self-labeling SynNotch and CARs for programable antigen-targeting technology platform. We paid the University of Pittsburgh a non-refundable fee in the amount of $75,000 for the exclusive patent rights to the licensed technology.
 
A key potential benefit that we see in the licensed technology is its potential application in therapeutic treatments that involve solid tumors. While there are currently a number of FDA-approved CAR-T therapies for hematologic malignancies, there are currently no CAR-T therapies marketed that are indicated for the treatment of solid tumors.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we have been assigned the worldwide development and commercialization rights to the licensed technology in the field of human treatment of cancer with antibody or antibody fragments using SNAP-CAR T cell technology, along with (i) an intellectual property portfolio consisting of issued and pending patents and (ii) options regarding future add-on technologies and developments. In consideration of these rights, we paid an initial license fee of $75,000, and will have annual maintenance fees ranging between $15,000 and $25,000, as well as developmental milestone payments (as defined in the agreement and royalties equal to 3.5% of net sales. Additionally, the agreement contemplates that we will enter into a Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of Pittsburgh within ninety days of the execution of the agreement, with the goal of further researching and optimizing the SNAP-CAR platform.
 
The Sponsored Research: We recently entered into a sponsored research agreement (“SRA”) with the University of Pittsburgh, the focus of which is to perform pre-clinical research as it relates to our SNAP-CAR program. Our target objectives are to: (i) test and validate CRO antibody conjugation chemistry and improve the activity of adaptors by investigating alternative chemical composition, (ii) investigate HER2 solid-tumor model in mice for both breast and ovarian cancers, (iii) identify and test other non-HER2 targets, (iv) further investigate multi-antigen targeting by dosing multiple adaptors simultaneously to address tumor heterogeneity/resistance in hematological and/or solid tumors and (v) expand the potential impact of SNAP-CAR by performing in vitro screening of many additional antigen-antibody combinations in hematological and/or solid tumors. The term of the SRA is two years, and we have committed financing in the amount of $716,714 over the next two years towards achieving the target objectives.

The SNAP-CAR Platform: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy is a new treatment for cancer in which a patient’s T cells (a type of immune cell) are genetically engineered to recognize cancer cells to target and destroy them. Cells are extracted from the patient and then genetically engineered to make the CAR and are re-introduced back into the patient. This therapy is revolutionizing the treatment of many blood cancers including B cell leukemias and lymphomas by targeting specific proteins found on these cancers, and there is hope in treating additional cancers including solid tumors by having them recognize new targets. The “SNAP-CAR” CAR T cell therapy platform is being developed to be a universal therapeutic. The SNAP-CAR technology is in the preclinical stage of development at the University of Pittsburgh. Instead of directly binding to a target on the tumor cell, the CAR T cells are co-administered with one or more antibody adaptors that bind to the tumor cells and are fitted with a chemical group that irreversibly connects them to the SNAP-CAR on the therapeutic cells via a covalent bond. A covalent bond is the highest affinity bond possible, and we believe this binding could translate into highly potent therapeutic activity.
 
Pre-clinical studies in mice have demonstrated a potential benefit that by targeting solid tumors via antibody adaptor molecules, the SNAP-CAR therapy may be able to provide a highly programmable therapeutic platform, one that we envision could deliver several potential advantages over standard CAR-T treatments, including:
 

- | Reduction of Potential Toxicity: The therapeutic activity of the SNAP-CAR T cells is being developed to allow controls by way of the antibody dose, which we envision would allow clinicians to mitigate toxicity from over-activity. We also envision that the immune response against cancer may also be boosted in patients administered with additional doses of the tagged tumor-specific antibody; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Reduction in Cancer Relapse: Relapse from CAR T cell therapy often results from the loss or down-regulation of the targeted protein on the cancer. Our research and development will continue the pre-clinical development efforts to date, which focuses in part on the potential avoidance of or reduction in relapses by combining SNAP-CAR T cells with antibodies targeting multiple antigens at once. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Opportunity:  Due to its unique targeting and binding properties, we believe the SNAP-CAR platform could help accelerate the utilization and effectiveness of CAR T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors. By way of market size, according to Polaris Market Research, the CAR-T cell therapy market size is expected to reach $20.56 billion by 2029 (from $1.96 billion in 2021), representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.6% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2029. However, based on the anticipated application of the licensed technology (i.e. initially focusing on solid tumor treatment) we cannot at this time project the market size of our target market until we further develop the licensed technology and settle on the initial target indications and follow-up indications. Additional research and analysis are being conducted which will aid us in the proper identification and selection of the cancer indication(s) we intend to further study. Once the optimal indication(s) are selected and the overall development strategy is further identified, the market opportunity can be further defined.
CPT60621; Vici Health Sciences, LLC
 
In 2019, we entered into a co-development agreement with Vici Health Sciences, LLC (“Vici”). Through this partnership, we would co-develop, seek FDA approval and share ownership rights with Vici to CPT60621, a novel, ready to use, easy to swallow, oral liquid version of an already approved drug used for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). As we continue to direct its operational focus towards the Vy-Gen opportunities previously described, we have recently stopped allocating priority resources to the development of CPT60621. We are currently in negotiations in which Vici intends to buy-out most or all of our remaining ownership rights.
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently do not have in-house commercial capabilities required to market and distribute FDA-approved products. Therefore, we will be required to partner with firms who are capable of conducting all sales, marketing, distribution, contracting and pricing for our future products. There is assurance that we will be able to secure the services of such a firm or that any such firm will be able to achieve sales expectations.

Our Growth Strategy
 
To achieve our goals, we intend to deploy an aggressive, four-pronged, growth strategy listed below that we believe will help us maximize our success and deleverage some of the risk of finding, solely developing and funding our own products.
Portfolio Optimization — We will continue to evaluate, prioritize, optimize, and make appropriate changes in our pipeline portfolio as market development dynamics and/or product opportunities change. For example, it may be a strategic business decision for us to divest certain products and/or agreements to other companies so we can best focus on its core assets.
Strategic Partnerships — We will focus on expanding our existing pipeline through establishing strategic partnerships with companies that have interesting products and technologies. We intend to focus on novel, early-stage and preclinical assets in a variety of therapeutic areas, including oncology and autoimmune diseases.
Business Development — We will continue to seek acquisition or partnering novel products and technologies that we believe will improve patient outcomes. We will seek to identify companies with products and technologies that are seeking assistance in developing and commercializing these assets. We will assess the commercial market opportunities for all potential products and technologies to determine if there are enough advantages to allow them to be viable, if they are developed.
Commercial Development — While not a current key focus of our company, we will continue to analyze opportunities to participate and assist in the commercial development activities directly or with strategic partners. Commercial development activities may include, but are not limited to, clinical development, CMC manufacturing, supply chain management, market research, healthcare economics, market access, sales/marketing, and commercial launch strategies.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had five employees, of which four are full-time employees, and one is a part-time employee. Our employees are not represented by any labor union or any collective bargaining arrangement with respect to their employment with the Company. We have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes as a result of labor disputes. We believe that our employee relations are good.
 
Certain of our employees have been working remotely due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our operations or productivity may continue to be impacted throughout the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and government-mandated closures.
