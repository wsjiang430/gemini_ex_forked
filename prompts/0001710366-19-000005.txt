ITEM 1. | Business

General
All dollar amounts discussed in this section are in millions of U.S. dollars, except for per unit amounts, and unless otherwise indicated.
The Company was incorporated in Delaware on June 21, 2017 and became an independent, publicly-traded company on November 28, 2017 when our former parent split into two independently traded public companies, a natural gas company known as CNX Resources Corporation, and CONSOL Energy Inc. We and our predecessors have been mining coal, primarily in the Appalachian Basin, since 1864. As part of the separation, our former parent transferred to the Company substantially all of its coal-related assets, including its Pennsylvania Mining Complex, all of its interest in CONSOL Coal Resources LP, the CONSOL Marine Terminal and approximately 1.6 billion tons of Greenfield Reserves located in the Northern Appalachian Basin (“NAPP”), the Central Appalachian Basin (“CAPP”) and the Illinois Basin (“ILB”).
The address of our principal executive offices is 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Suite 100, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317. We maintain a website at http://www.consolenergy.com/ and the information contained in or connected to the website will not be deemed to be incorporated in this document, and you should not rely on any such information in making an investment decision.
Our Company
We are a leading, low-cost producer of high-quality bituminous coal, focused on the extraction and preparation of coal in the Appalachian Basin due to our ability to efficiently produce and deliver large volumes of high-quality coal at competitive prices, the strategic location of our mines and the industry experience of our management team. Our predecessors have been mining coal, primarily in the Appalachian Basin, since 1864.
Coal from the PAMC is valued because of its high energy content (as measured in Btu per pound), relatively low levels of sulfur and other impurities, and strong thermoplastic properties that enable it to be used in metallurgical as well as thermal applications. We take advantage of these desirable quality characteristics and our extensive logistical network, which is directly served by both the Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads, to aggressively market our product to a broad base of strategically selected, top-performing power plant customers in the eastern United States. We also capitalize on the operational synergies afforded by the CONSOL Marine Terminal to export our coal to thermal and metallurgical end users in Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa, as well as Canada. 
Our operations, including the PAMC and the CONSOL Marine Terminal, have consistently generated strong cash flows. As of December 31, 2018, the PAMC controls 698.5 million tons of high-quality Pittsburgh seam reserves, enough to allow for approximately 25 years of full-capacity production. In addition, we own or control approximately 1.6 billion tons of Greenfield Reserves located in the NAPP, the CAPP and the ILB, which we believe could provide a solid growth platform in the future. Our vision is to maximize cash flow generation through the safe, compliant and efficient operation of this core asset base, while strategically reducing debt, returning capital through share buybacks or dividends, and, when prudent, allocating capital toward compelling growth opportunities.
Our core businesses consist of our: 

• | Pennsylvania Mining Complex: The PAMC, which includes the Bailey Mine, the Enlow Fork Mine, the Harvey Mine and the Central Preparation Plant, has extensive high-quality coal reserves. We mine our reserves from the Pittsburgh No. 8 Coal Seam, which is a large contiguous formation of uniform, high-Btu coal that is ideal for high-productivity, low-cost longwall operations. The design of the PAMC is optimized to produce large quantities of coal on a cost-efficient basis. We are able to sustain high production volumes at comparatively low operating costs due to, among other things, our technologically advanced longwall mining systems, logistics infrastructure and safety. All of our mines utilize longwall mining, which is a highly automated underground mining technique that produces large volumes of coal at lower costs compared to other underground mining methods. We own a 75% undivided interest in PAMC, with the remaining 25% being owned by CCR, as discussed below.


• | CCR Ownership: CONSOL Energy owns, directly or indirectly, through CCR's general partner, 61.7% of the partnership, which is comprised of a 1.7% general partner interest and 60.0% limited partner interest. At December 31, 2018, CCR’s assets included a 25% undivided interest in, and full operational control over, the PAMC.

• | CONSOL Marine Terminal: Through our subsidiary CONSOL Marine Terminals LLC we provide coal export terminal services through the Port of Baltimore. The terminal can either store coal or load coal directly into vessels from rail cars. It is also one of the few terminals in the United States served by two railroads, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Transportation Inc.


• | Greenfield Reserves: Ownership of approximately 1.6 billion tons of high-quality, undeveloped coal reserves located in NAPP, CAPP and the ILB.

A map showing the location of our significant properties is below: 
The Company's mission is to improve lives and communities by safely and compliantly producing affordable, reliable energy and profitably growing through innovative technology and perseverance. Our core values of safety, compliance, and continuous improvement are the foundation of the Company’s identity and are the basis for how management defines continued success. We believe the Company’s rich resource base, coupled with these core values, allows management to create value for the long-term. We believe that the use of coal as a principal fuel source for electricity in the United States will continue for many years. Additionally, we believe that as worldwide economies grow, the demand for electricity from fossil fuels will grow as well, resulting in expansion of worldwide demand for our coal.

Our Relationship with CONSOL Coal Resources LP
In July 2015, CONSOL Coal Resources LP, formerly known as CNX Coal Resources LP, closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,000,000 common units representing limited partnership interests at a price to the public of $15.00 per unit. The underwriters in the CCR initial public offering exercised an over-allotment option to purchase and resell an additional 561,067 common units to the public at $15.00 per unit. In conjunction with the IPO, CCR sold an additional 5,000,000 common units representing limited partnership interests in a private placement. CCR’s general partner is CONSOL Coal Resources GP LLC, formerly known as CNX Coal Resources GP LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The initial assets of CCR were comprised of a 20% undivided interest in PAMC. 
CCR is managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of its general partner, CONSOL Coal Resources GP LLC, many of whom are also executive officers of the Company. The General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company has the right to appoint the entire board of directors of the General Partner, including its independent directors. CCR’s unitholders are not entitled to elect the directors of the General Partner nor can they directly or indirectly participate in the management of CCR. The executive officers of the General Partner are compensated by us or certain of our affiliates. Under our omnibus agreement with CCR, CCR reimburses us for compensation-related expenses (including salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts) attributable to the portion of an executive’s compensation that is allocable to that executive’s service for the General Partner. 
In September 2016, CCR and its wholly owned subsidiary, CONSOL Thermal Holdings LLC (“CONSOL Thermal”), formerly known as CNX Thermal Holdings LLC, entered into a Contribution Agreement with our former parent, CONSOL Pennsylvania Coal Company LLC and Conrhein Coal Company under which CONSOL Thermal acquired an additional 5% undivided interest in and to the Pennsylvania Mining Complex, in exchange for (i) cash consideration in the amount of $21.5 million and (ii) CCR’s issuance of 3,956,496 Class A Preferred Units representing limited partnership interests in CCR at an issue price of $17.01 per Class A Preferred Unit, or an aggregate $67.3 million in equity consideration. 
On October 2, 2017, our former parent provided a conversion notice to CCR with respect to all Class A Preferred Units owned by it, and thereafter caused all such Class A Preferred Units to convert, on a 1-to-1 ratio, into common units representing limited partnership interests in CCR. 
In connection with the separation, our former parent transferred all of its ownership interest in CCR to the Company, which consisted of (i) 5,006,496 common units and 11,611,067 subordinated units (representing a ~60% limited partnership interest), and (ii) 1.7% general partner interest and all incentive distribution rights (“IDRs”). Subordinated units are not entitled to any distribution from CCR unless CCR makes a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.5125 per common unit. CCR made minimum distributions per subordinated unit equal to the distribution per common unit for thirteen of the fourteen quarters since CCR’s IPO; CCR did not meet the requirement for a subordinated unit distribution with respect to fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016. IDRs entitle the holder to receive increasing percentages, up to a maximum of 48%, of the available cash CCR distributes from operating surplus in excess of $0.5894 per unit per quarter. The maximum distribution of 48% does not include any distributions that the General Partner or its affiliates may receive on common units, subordinated units, or the General Partner interest that they own.
Our Strategy 
Our strategy is to increase stockholder value by safely and compliantly operating our business, developing and growing our existing coal assets and participating in global coal markets. The Company’s coal assets align with our long-term strategic objectives. Our current production, which includes production from the Bailey, Enlow Fork and Harvey mines, can be sold domestically or abroad, as either thermal coal or high volatile metallurgical coal. These low-cost mines, with five longwalls, produce a high-Btu Pittsburgh-seam coal that is lower in sulfur than many Northern Appalachian coals. Our onsite logistics infrastructure at the Central Preparation Plant includes a dual-batch train loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 tons of coal per hour and 19.3 miles of track linked to separate Class I rail lines owned by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which significantly increases our efficiency in meeting our customers’ transportation needs. These mines and their logistics infrastructure, along with our 100%-owned CONSOL Marine Terminal, which is served by both Norfolk Southern and CSX, will allow us to continue to participate in the world’s thermal and metallurgical coal markets. The ability to serve both domestic and international markets with premium thermal and crossover metallurgical coal provides tremendous optionality. 

10

In order to continue to carry out our strategy, we will continue to adhere to and pursue the following strategic objectives: 
Selectively grow our business to maximize shareholder value by capitalizing on synergies with our assets and expertise 
We plan to judiciously direct the cash generated by our operations toward those opportunities that present the greatest potential for value creation to our shareholders, particularly those that take advantage of synergies with our asset base and/or with the expertise of our management team. To that end, we plan to regularly and rigorously evaluate opportunities both for organic growth and for acquisitions, joint ventures and other business arrangements in the coal industry and related industries that complement our core operations. In addition, our ownership interest in CCR provides us with a unique vehicle for generating cash and raising capital, through the potential future drop down of assets into CCR which, if utilized, will allow us to generate cash to assist in the execution of our growth strategy. Both the PAMC and our Greenfield Reserves present the potential for organic growth projects if long-term market conditions are favorable. For example, we are currently negotiating a project to improve the recovery and processing of fine coal from the Central Preparation Plant, which has the potential to add up to 1.5 million tons per year of additional clean coal production without additional mining of raw tons. We are also actively engaged in research and development projects to improve the productivity of our Central Preparation Plant and our longwall operations through the use of technology and automation, such as de-bottlenecking projects at the Central Preparation Plant and shearer automation technology. Moreover, the Harvey Mine’s existing infrastructure, including its bottom development, slope belt and material handling system, is able to support an additional permanent longwall mining system with moderate additional capital investment in mining equipment. Such an investment would further increase the annual production capacity of the PAMC by approximately 5 million tons. Our Greenfield Reserves associated with the potential Mason Dixon and River Mine projects present additional organic growth opportunities in NAPP, and our Greenfield Reserves associated with the Itmann Mine, Martinka Mine and Birch Mine provide actionable organic growth opportunities in the metallurgical coal space, which we are currently evaluating. Our management team has extensive experience in developing, operating and marketing a wide variety of coal assets, and is well qualified to evaluate organic and external growth opportunities. We intend to prudently use our interest in CCR to benefit our growth strategy, and plan to carefully weigh any capital investment decisions against alternate uses of the cash to help ensure we are delivering the most value to our shareholders. 
Continue to grow our share at top-performing rail-served power plants in our core market areas, while opportunistically pursuing export and crossover metallurgical opportunities 
We plan to seek to minimize our market risk and maximize realizations by continuing to focus on selling coal to strategically-selected, top-performing, rail-served power plants located in our core market areas in the eastern United States. In 2018, our top domestic power plant customers included twelve plants that each took delivery of more than 500,000 tons of PAMC coal. These top power plant customers, which collectively accounted for 88% of our domestic coal shipments in 2018, operated at a 12% greater weighted average capacity factor than other NAPP rail-served plants during January through October (the most recent month for which data are available), and none have announced plans to retire during the next five years. We have grown our share at these plants from 10% in 2012 to 42% in the first ten months of 2018, and we believe we can continue to grow this share by displacing less competitive supply from NAPP, CAPP and other basins. We also plan to continue to work on optimizing our portfolio of top customer plants and identifying and penetrating new plants that we believe are aligned with our strategic objectives and would be a good fit for our coal. For example, we increased the volume of PAMC coal shipped to our two largest domestic customer plants in 2018 from 2.3 million tons in 2017 to 5.5 million tons in 2018. While the majority of our production is directed toward our established base of domestic power plant customers, many of which are secured through annual or multi-year contracts, we also have continued to diversify our portfolio by placing a growing portion of our production in the export and crossover metallurgical markets. These markets provide us with pricing upside when markets are strong and with volume stability when markets are weak. For 2019 and 2020, our contracted position, as of February 7, 2019, is at >95% and 53%, respectively, assuming a 27 million ton annual coal sales volume. We believe our committed and contracted position is well-balanced in hedging against market downside risk while allowing us to continue to build out our portfolio strategically and opportunistically as the market evolves. 
Drive operational excellence through safety, compliance, and continuous improvement 
We intend to continue focusing on our core values of safety, compliance and continuous improvement. We operate some of the most productive, lowest-cost underground mines in the coal industry, while simultaneously setting some of the industry’s highest standards for safety and compliance. For 2014 through 2018, our Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) reportable incident rate was approximately 34% lower than the national average underground bituminous coal mine incident rate. Furthermore, our MSHA significant and substantial (“S&S”) citation rate per 100 inspection hours was approximately 36% lower than the industry’s average MSHA S&S citation rate over the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018. We believe that our focus on safety and compliance promotes greater reliability in our operations, which fosters long-term customer relationships and lower operating costs that support higher margins. Consistent with our core value of continuous improvement, we have 
11

improved our productivity from 5.69 tons per employee hour in 2014 to 7.62 tons per employee hour in 2018, and have reduced our cash costs of coal sold per ton by 21% over this same period. We intend to continue to grow the economic competiveness of our operations by proactively identifying, pursuing and implementing efficiency improvements and new technologies that can drive down unit costs without compromising safety or compliance. 
Ability to Access Capital Markets through Various Financing Vehicles 
Our controlling ownership interest in the Partnership provides us with a unique vehicle for generating cash and raising capital to pursue our growth strategy. Over time we may drop down assets into CCR. We believe that such drop-downs, if utilized, would allow us to grow CCR’s distributions and potentially increase the value of the units and incentive distribution rights of CCR that we hold. Furthermore, the cash generated from these drop-downs could help us to accelerate the execution of our growth strategy. Finally, we believe that our different classes of securities (common stock and partnership units) provide us with multiple options for accessing capital markets and taking advantage of the best available cost of capital at any given point in time. We believe this is a unique advantage for us compared to other companies in the coal industry. 
We have generated significant free cash flow since the separation and distribution, which has allowed us to opportunistically pay down our debt. This reduced leverage on our balance sheet and improved liquidity allows us to pursue attractive organic growth opportunities and accretive acquisitions. We constantly seek to improve our capital market capacity to provide additional funds, if needed, to grow our business.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we are well-positioned to successfully execute our business strategies because of the following competitive strengths: 
Focus on free cash flow generation supported by industry-leading margins and optimized production levels 
We intend to continue our focus on maintaining high margins by optimizing production from our high-quality reserves and leveraging our extensive logistics infrastructure and broad market reach. The PAMC’s low-cost structure, high-quality product, favorable access to rail and port infrastructure and diverse base of end-use customers allow it to move large volumes of coal at positive cash margins throughout a variety of market conditions. For example, despite recent challenging domestic market conditions driven largely by relatively mild weather, low natural gas prices, and stagnant electricity demand, which caused total U.S. coal production to fall by approximately 15% from 2015 to 2018, PAMC managed to grow production by approximately 21% during this same period. Through our recent capital investment program, we have optimized our mining operations and logistics infrastructure to sustainably drive down our cash operating costs. Furthermore, our significant portfolio of multi-year, committed and priced contracts with our longstanding customer base will enhance our ability to sustain high margins in varied commodity price environments. We believe that these factors will help enable us to maintain higher margins per ton on average than our competitors and better position us to maintain profitability throughout commodity price cycles. 
Extensive, High-Quality Reserve Base 
The PAMC has extensive high-quality reserves of bituminous coal. We mine our reserves from the Pittsburgh No. 8 Coal Seam, which is a large contiguous formation of uniform, high-Btu coal that is ideal for high-productivity, low-cost longwall operations. As of December 31, 2018, the PAMC included 698.5 million tons of recoverable coal reserves that are sufficient to support approximately 25 years of full-capacity production. The advantageous qualities of our coal enable us to compete for demand from a broader range of coal-fired power plants compared to mining operations in basins that typically produce coal with a comparatively lower heat content (ILB and the Powder River Basin (“PRB”)), higher sulfur content (ILB and most areas in NAPP) and higher chlorine content (certain areas of ILB). Our remaining reserves have an average as-received gross heat content of 12,907 Btu/lb, while production from the PRB, ILB, CAPP and the rest of NAPP averages approximately 8,700 Btu/lb, 11,300 Btu/lb, 12,200 Btu/lb and 12,400 Btu/lb, respectively (based on the average quality reported by EIA for U.S. power plant deliveries for the three years ended June 30, 2018). Moreover, our remaining reserves have an average sulfur content of 2.30%, while production from the ILB averages ~2.9% sulfur and production from the rest of NAPP averages ~3.3% sulfur (again, based on EIA power plant delivery data for the three years ended June 30, 2018). With our high Btu content and low-cost structure, our 2018 total costs of tons sold averaged $1.37 per mmBtu, which is lower than any monthly average Louisiana Henry Hub natural gas spot price during the past 20+ years, and provides a strong foundation for competing against natural gas even after accounting for differences in delivered costs and power plant efficiencies. In addition to the substantial reserve base associated with the PAMC, our 1.6 billion tons of Greenfield Reserves in NAPP, CAPP and ILB feature both thermal and metallurgical reserves and provide additional optionality for organic growth or monetization as market conditions allow. 
12

World-Class, Well-Capitalized, Low-Cost Longwall Mining Complex 
Since 2006, we have invested over $2.4 billion at the PAMC ($1.5 billion of which has been invested in the past seven years) to develop technologically advanced, large-scale longwall mining operations and related production and logistics infrastructure. As a result, the PAMC is the most productive and efficient coal mining complex in NAPP, averaging 7.31 tons of coal production per employee hour in 2016-2017, compared to 5.57 tons of coal production per employee hour for other currently-operating NAPP longwall mines. For the year ending December 31, 2018, productivity further increased to 7.62 tons of coal per employee hour, compared with an average of 5.18 tons per employee hour for all other currently-operating NAPP longwalls. We believe our substantial capital investment in the PAMC will enable us to maintain high production volumes, low operating costs and a strong safety and environmental compliance record, which we believe are key to supporting stable financial performance and cash flows throughout business and commodity price cycles. 
Strategically Located Mining Operations with Advanced Distribution Capabilities and Excellent Access to Key Logistics Infrastructure 
Our logistics infrastructure and proximity to coal-fired power plants in the eastern United States provide us with operational and marketing flexibility, reduce the cost to deliver coal to our core markets and allow us to realize higher free-on-board (“FOB”) mine prices. We believe that we have a significant transportation cost advantage compared to many of our competitors, particularly producers in the ILB and PRB, for deliveries to customers in our core markets and to East Coast ports for international shipping. For example, based on publicly available data and internal estimates, we believe that the transportation cost advantage from our mines compared to ILB mines (not accounting for Btu differences) is approximately $3 to $8 per ton for coal delivered to foreign consumers in Europe and India, up to $3 to $5 per ton for coal delivered to domestic customers in the Carolinas, and an even more pronounced cost advantage for coal delivered to domestic customers in the mid-Atlantic states. Our ability to accommodate multiple unit trains at the Central Preparation Plant, which includes a dual-batch loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 tons of clean coal per hour and 19.3 miles of track with three sidings, allows for the seamless transition of locomotives from empty inbound trains to fully loaded outbound trains at our facility. Furthermore, the PAMC has exceptional access to export infrastructure in the United States. Through our 100%-owned CONSOL Marine Terminal, served by both the Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads, we are able to participate in the world’s seaborne coal markets with premium thermal and crossover metallurgical coal. 
Strong, Well-Established Customer Base Supporting Contractual Volumes 
We have a well-established and diverse blue chip customer base, comprised primarily of domestic electric-power-producing companies located in the eastern United States. We have had success entering into multi-year coal sales agreements with our customers due to our longstanding relationships, reliability of production and delivery, competitive pricing and high coal quality. More than 90% of our sales in 2018 were to customer companies that were in our 2017 portfolio, and all but one of our top domestic power plant customers in 2018 (which represent the twelve plants to which we shipped at least 500,000 tons of PAMC coal in 2018), have been in our portfolio for at least five consecutive years. In addition, to mitigate our exposure with respect to coal-fired power plant retirements, we have strategically developed our customer base to include power plants that are economically positioned to continue operating for the foreseeable future and that are equipped with state-of-the-art environmental controls. In 2018, less than 1.5% of our total sales were to domestic power plant customers that have announced plans to retire during the next five years. Moreover, none of our top twelve customer plants, which accounted for 88% of our domestic coal shipments in 2018, have announced plans to retire in the next five years. These top plants operated at a 12% higher weighted average capacity factor than other NAPP rail-served plants in January-October 2018 (the most recent month for which data are available), highlighting their economic competitiveness in the challenging power markets. Since 2012, the Company has increased its market share at these twelve plants from 10% to 42%. In addition to our robust domestic customer base, we also have favorable access to seaborne coal markets through our long-standing commercial relationship with a leading coal trading and brokering customer that maintains a broad market presence with foreign coal consumers. We have grown our exports of PAMC coal to the seaborne thermal and crossover metallurgical markets from an average of 5.5 million tons per year (or approximately 23% of our annual sales volume) in 2015-2016 to 8.0 million tons (or approximately 29% of our annual sales volume) in 2018. 
Highly Experienced Management Team and Operating Team 
Our management and operating teams have (i) significant expertise owning, developing and managing complex thermal and metallurgical coal mining operations, (ii) valuable relationships with customers, railroads and other participants across the coal industry, (iii) technical wherewithal and demonstrated success in developing new applications and customers for our coal products, in both the thermal and metallurgical markets, and (iv) a proven track record of successfully building, enhancing and managing coal assets in a reliable and cost-effective manner throughout all parts of the commodity cycle. We intend to leverage these qualities to continue to successfully develop our coal mining assets while efficiently and flexibly managing our operations to maximize operating cash flow.

CONSOL Energy’s Capital Expenditure Budget
In 2019, CONSOL Energy expects to invest $135 - $155 million in maintenance capital expenditures. The Company continually evaluates potential acquisitions.
Detail Coal Operations
Recoverable Coal Reserves 
The Company's estimates of recoverable coal reserves are calculated internally using the face positions of the Pennsylvania Mining Complex’s longwall mines as of December 31, 2018. The December 31, 2018 reserves were estimated using the same techniques and assumptions as in prior years. These estimates are based on geologic data, coal ownership information and current and proposed mine plans. CONSOL Energy's recoverable coal reserves are proven and probable reserves that could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination, taking into account mining recovery and preparation plant yield. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect past coal production, new drilling information and other geologic or mining data. Acquisitions or dispositions of coal properties will also change these estimates. Changes in mining methods may increase or decrease the recovery basis for a coal seam, as will changes in preparation plant processes. The ability to update or modify the estimates of the Company's recoverable coal reserves is restricted to the exploration group and all modifications are documented. 
“Reserves” are defined by SEC Industry Guide 7 as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Industry Guide 7 divides reserves between “Proven (Measured) Reserves” and “Probable (Indicated) Reserves,” which are defined as follows:

• | “Proven (Measured) Reserves.” Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; and grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well-established.


• | “Probable (Indicated) Reserves.” Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for Proven (Measured) Reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for Proven (Measured) Reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.

Spacing of points of observation for confidence levels in the Company's reserve calculations is based on guidelines in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 891 (Coal Resource Classification System of the U.S. Geological Survey). CONSOL Energy's estimates for proven reserves have the highest degree of geologic assurance. Because of the well-known continuity of the Pittsburgh No. 8 Coal Seam, estimates for proven reserves are based on points of observation that are equal to or less than 3,000 feet, and estimates for probable reserves are computed from points of observation that are between 3,000 feet and 7,920 feet apart.
The Company's estimates of recoverable coal reserves do not rely on isolated points of observation. Small pods of reserves based on a single observation point are not considered; continuity between observation points over a large area is necessary for proven or probable reserves.
The Company's recoverable coal reserves fall within the range of commercially marketed coal grades in the United States. The marketability of coal depends on its value-in-use for a particular application, and this is affected by coal quality, including sulfur content, ash content and heating value. Modern power plant boiler design aspects can compensate for coal quality differences that occur. As a result, all of the Company's coal can be marketed for the electric power generation industry. In addition, the Company's reserves currently exhibit thermoplastic behavior suitable for cokemaking, which enables it, if market dynamics are favorable, to capture greater margins from selling its coal in the metallurgical market to cokemakers and steel manufacturers who utilize modern cokemaking technologies. The addition of this crossover market adds additional assurance that CONSOL Energy's recoverable coal reserves are commercially marketable. 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had an estimated 2.3 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. As of December 31, 2018, the PAMC included 698.5 million tons of recoverable coal reserves that are sufficient to support approximately 25 years of full-capacity production. Estimates of the Company’s recoverable coal reserves have historically been calculated both by internal geologists and engineers and independent third parties. Reserve estimates and evaluation processes are periodically audited by independent third parties to ensure accuracy. 
14

The Company’s recoverable coal reserves include 87 million tons of undeveloped reserves that are classified as high-vol, mid-vol or low-vol metallurgical coal. Additionally, worldwide demand for metallurgical coal allows some of our recoverable coal reserves, currently classified as thermal coal but that possess certain qualities, to be sold as metallurgical coal. The extent to which we can sell thermal coal as crossover metallurgical coal depends upon a number of factors, including the quality characteristics of the reserve, the specific quality requirements and constraints of the end-use customer and market conditions (which affect whether customers are compelled to substitute lower-quality crossover coal for higher-quality metallurgical coal in their blends to realize economic benefits). The addition of this cross-over market adds additional assurance to the Company that all of its recoverable coal reserves are commercially marketable. 
The Company assigns coal reserves to each mine within the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The amount of coal we assign to the Pennsylvania Mining Complex generally is sufficient to support mining through the duration of our current mining permit. Under federal law, we must renew our mining permits every five years. All assigned reserves have their required permits or governmental approvals, or there is a high probability that these approvals will be secured. In addition, the Pennsylvania Mining Complex may have access to additional reserves that have not yet been assigned. We refer to these reserves as accessible. Accessible reserves are recoverable coal reserves that can be accessed by an existing mining complex, utilizing the existing infrastructure of the complex to mine and to process the coal in this area. Mining an accessible reserve does not require additional capital spending beyond that required to extend or to continue the normal progression of the mine, such as the sinking of airshafts or the construction of portal facilities. 
Some reserves may be accessible by more than one mine because of the proximity of many of our mines to one another. In the table below, the accessible reserves indicated for a mine are based on our review of current mining plans and reflect our best judgment as to which mine is most likely to utilize the reserve. Assigned and unassigned coal reserves are recoverable coal reserves which are either owned or leased. The leases have terms extending up to 30 years and generally provide for renewal through the anticipated life of the associated mine. These renewals are exercisable by the payment of minimum royalties. Under current mining plans, assigned reserves reported will be mined out within the period of existing leases or within the time period of probable lease renewal periods.

Pennsylvania Mining Complex 
Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located in Enon, Pennsylvania and consists of three deep longwall mining operations, the Bailey Mine, the Enlow Fork Mine and the Harvey Mine, and a centralized preparation plant. The design of the PAMC is optimized to produce large quantities of coal on a cost-efficient basis. The PAMC is able to sustain high production volumes at comparatively low operating costs due to, among other things, its technologically advanced longwall mining systems, logistics infrastructure and safety. All of the PAMC's mines utilize longwall mining, which is a highly automated underground mining technique that produces large volumes of coal at lower costs compared to other underground mining methods. The PAMC typically operates five longwalls and 15-17 continuous mining sections. The current annual production capacity of the PAMC is approximately 28.5 million tons of coal. The central preparation plant is connected via conveyor belts to each of the PAMC's mines and cleans and processes up to 8,200 tons of coal per hour. The PAMC's on-site logistics infrastructure at the central preparation plant includes a dual-batch train loadout facility capable of loading up to 9,000 tons of coal per hour and 19.3 miles of track linked to separate Class I rail lines owned by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which significantly increases the PAMC's efficiency in meeting its customers' transportation needs.
Bailey Mine. The Bailey Mine is the first mine developed at the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. As of December 31, 2018, the Bailey mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 163.4 million tons of clean recoverable coal with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,890 Btus per pound and an approximate average pounds of sulfur dioxide per mmBtu of 4.05. Construction of the slope and initial air shaft began in 1982. The slope development reached the coal seam at a depth of approximately 600 feet and, following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in 1984. Longwall mining production commenced in 1985, and the second longwall was placed into operation in 1987. In 2010, a new slope and overland belt system was commissioned, which allowed a large percentage of the Bailey mine to be sealed off. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Bailey mine produced 12.7, 12.1 and 12.1 million tons of coal, respectively. The Bailey mine typically employs six to seven continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. 
Enlow Fork Mine. The Enlow Fork Mine is located directly north of the Bailey Mine. As of December 31, 2018, the Enlow Fork mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 333.6 million tons of clean recoverable coal with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,940 Btus per pound and an approximate average pounds of sulfur dioxide per mmBtu of 3.21. Initial underground development was started from the Bailey mine while the Enlow Fork slope was being constructed. Once the slope bottom was developed and the slope belt became operational, seals were constructed to separate the two mines. Following development of the slope bottom, commercial coal production began in 1989. Longwall mining production commenced in 1991, and the second longwall came online in 1992. In 2014, a new slope and overland belt system was commissioned and a substantial portion of the Enlow Fork mine was sealed. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Enlow Fork mine produced 9.9, 9.2 and 9.6 million tons of coal, respectively. The Enlow Fork mine typically employs six to seven continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. 
Harvey Mine. The Harvey Mine is located directly east of the Bailey and Enlow Fork Mines. As of December 31, 2018, the Harvey mine’s assigned and accessible reserve base contained an aggregate of 201.5 million tons of clean recoverable coal with an average as-received gross heat content of approximately 12,870 Btus per pound and an approximate average pounds of sulfur dioxide per mmBtu of 3.76. Similar to the Enlow Fork mine, the Harvey mine was developed off of the Bailey mine’s slope bottom. Once the slope for the Harvey mine was placed into operation, seals were built to separate the two mines, and the original slope was dedicated solely to the Harvey mine, which eliminated the need to make significant capital expenditures to develop, among other things, a new slope, air shaft and portal facility. Development of the Harvey mine began in 2009, and construction of the supporting surface facilities commenced in 2011. Longwall mining production commenced in March 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Harvey mine produced 5.0, 4.8 and 3.0 million tons of coal, respectively. The Harvey mine typically employs three continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for its longwall panels. The Harvey mine’s existing infrastructure, including its bottom development, slope belt and material handling system, has the capacity to add one incremental permanent longwall mining system with additional mine development and capital investment.

(1) | The heat values (gross calorific values) shown for Assigned Operating reserves are based on the 2018 actual quality and five-year forecasted quality for each mine/reserve, assuming that the coal is washed to an extent consistent with normal full-capacity operation of each mine's/complex’s preparation plant. Actual quality is based on laboratory analysis of samples collected from coal shipments delivered in 2018. Forecasted quality is derived from exploration sample analysis results, which have been adjusted to account for anticipated moisture and for the effects of mining and coal preparation. The heat values (gross calorific values) shown for Accessible Reserves are on an as-received basis (dry values obtained from drill hole analyses, adjusted for moisture) and are prorated by the associated Assigned Operating product values to account for similar mining and processing methods.


(2) | Recoverable reserves are calculated based on the area in which mineable coal exists, coal seam thickness, and average density determined by laboratory testing of drill core samples. This calculation is adjusted to account for coal that will not be recovered during mining and for losses that occur if the coal is processed after mining. Reserve tons are reported on an as-received basis, based on the anticipated product moisture. Reserves are reported only for those coal seams that are controlled by ownership or leases.


(3) | Recoverable coal reserves decreased 37 million tons from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, as a result of producing 27.6 million tons in the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as a reduction of 9.4 million tons from a re-evaluation and reallocation of recoverable coal reserves among the three mines at the PAMC.

Production 
In the year ended December 31, 2018, 100% of the Company's production came from underground mines equipped with longwall mining systems. The Company employs longwall mining techniques in its underground mines where the geology is favorable and reserves are sufficient. Underground longwall mining uses continuous mining units to develop the mains and gate roads for longwall panels. The longwall systems are highly mechanized, capital intensive operations to efficiently extract coal within the longwall panels. Mines using longwall systems have a low variable cost structure compared with other types of mines and can achieve high productivity levels compared with those of other underground mining methods. Because the Company has substantial reserves readily suitable to these operations, the Company believes that these longwall mines can increase capacity at a low incremental cost.

The following table shows the production, in millions of tons, for the Company's mines for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the location of each mine, the type of mine, the type of equipment used at each mine, method of transportation and the year each mine was established or acquired by us.

We sell coal produced by our mines and additional coal that is purchased by us for resale from other producers. We maintain a United States sales office in Pittsburgh. Approximately 68% of our 2018 coal sales were made to U.S. electric generators, 29% of our 2018 coal sales were priced on export markets and 3% of our 2018 coal sales were made to other domestic customers. Approximately 65% of our 2017 coal sales were made to U.S. electric generators, 32% of our 2017 coal sales were priced on export markets and 3% of our 2017 coal sales were made to other domestic customers. Approximately 75% of our 2016 coal sales were made to U.S. electric generators, 22% of our 2016 coal sales were priced on export markets and 3% of our 2016 coal sales were made to other domestic customers. We had sales to approximately 35 customers from our 2018 coal operations. During 2018, three customers each comprised over 10% of our coal sales, aggregating approximately 57% of our sales. Annual metallurgical coal revenues for the past three years ranged from $68.3 million to $82.1 million. 
20

Coal Contracts and Pricing
We sell coal to an established customer base through opportunities as a result of strong business relationships, or through a formalized bidding process. Contract volumes range from a single shipment to multi-year agreements for millions of tons of coal. The average contract term is between one to three years. As a normal course of business, efforts are made to renew or extend contracts scheduled to expire. Although there are no guarantees, we generally have been successful in renewing or extending contracts in the past. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 68% of all the coal we produced was sold under contracts with terms of one year or more. 
We expect total consolidated Pennsylvania Mining Complex annual sales to be approximately 27 million tons for 2019 and 2020. Coal pricing for contracts with terms of one year or less is generally fixed. Coal pricing for multiple-year agreements generally provides the opportunity to periodically adjust the contract prices through pricing mechanisms consisting of one or more of the following: 

• | Fixed price contracts with pre-established prices;


• | Periodically negotiated prices that reflect market conditions at the time;


• | Price restricted to an agreed-upon percentage increase or decrease;


• | Base-price-plus-escalation methods which allow for periodic price adjustments based on inflation indices or other negotiated indices; or


• | Positive electric power price-related adjustments.

The volume of coal to be delivered is specified in each of our coal contracts. Although the volume to be delivered under the coal contracts is stipulated, the parties may vary the timing of the deliveries within specified limits. Coal contracts typically contain force majeure provisions allowing for the suspension of performance by either party for the duration of certain force majeure events. Force majeure events include, but are not limited to, unexpected significant geological conditions or natural disasters. Depending on the language of the contract, some contracts may terminate upon continuance of an event of force majeure that extends for a period greater than three to twelve months. 
Of our 2018 sales tons, approximately 68% were sold to U.S. electric generators, 29% were priced on export thermal markets and 3% were sold to other domestic customers. In 2018, we derived greater than 10% of our total coal sales revenue from three customers. As of January 1, 2019, we had six sales agreements with these customers that expire at various times in 2019 through 2021.
During the past three years, our average realization (sales price per ton sold) for coal produced from the PAMC increased from $43.31/ton in 2016 to $49.28/ton in 2018. Pricing for our product depends strongly on conditions in the domestic thermal coal market, which accounted for at least 68% of our total sales volumes in each of 2016, 2017, and 2018. 
The prices we are able to achieve in the domestic thermal market depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the supply-demand balance for Northern Appalachian coal, (ii) prices for other competing sources of energy used for electricity generation, such as natural gas, (iii) power prices in the regions we serve, (iv) prices for coals from other basins (including the Central Appalachian Basin, Illinois Basin, and Powder River Basin) that compete in these same regions, and (v) pricing under our longer-term contracts, which may have been entered into under different market conditions. Lower natural gas prices, coupled with increased capacity from new natural gas combined-cycle power plants, put pressure on power prices and on the demand for coal-fired electric power generation. Colder winter weather in 2018, coupled with more normal summer weather have allowed power plants to draw their inventories down further and contributed to a rebound in demand. These factors affect the prices that we are able to achieve in the domestic thermal markets as older contracts roll off and are replaced by new contracts. Similarly, imbalances in global supply and demand for coal can cause substantial variability in pricing in the export thermal market and the export metallurgical market.
Terminal Services 
In 2018, approximately 12.4 million tons of coal were shipped through the CONSOL Marine Terminal owned by our subsidiary, CONSOL Marine Terminals LLC. Approximately 60% of the tonnage shipped was produced by the Pennsylvania Mining Complex. The terminal can either store coal or load coal directly into vessels from rail cars. It is also one of the few terminals in the United States served by two railroads, Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Transportation Inc. CONSOL Marine Terminal has significant storage capacity of 1.1 million tons with more than thirty acres of capacity for stockpiles. The facility possesses extensive blending capabilities, and has handled over 11 million tons of coal per year on average since 2010, with a potential maximum throughput capacity of 15 million tons annually. 
21

Non-Core Coal Assets and Surface Properties 
We own significant coal assets that are not in our short or medium term development plans. We continually explore the monetization of these non-core assets by means of sale, lease, contribution to joint ventures, or a combination of the foregoing in order to bring the value of these assets forward for the benefit of our stockholders. 
Distribution
Coal is transported from the Company’s mining operations to customers by railroad cars, trucks, vessels or a combination of these means of transportation. Most customers negotiate their own transportation rates and we employ transportation specialists who negotiate freight and equipment agreements with various transportation suppliers, including railroads, barge lines, terminal operators, ocean vessel brokers and trucking companies for certain customers. 
Seasonality
Our business has historically experienced limited variability in its results due to the effect of seasonal changes. Demand for coal-fired power can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather as power consumers use more air conditioning or heating, respectively. Conversely, mild weather can result in weaker demand for our coal. Adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards or floods, can impact our ability to transport coal over our overland conveyor systems and to transport our coal by rail.
Competition 
The coal industry is highly competitive, with numerous producers selling into all markets that use coal. There are numerous large and small producers in all coal producing basins of the United States, and we compete with many of these producers, including those who export coal abroad. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. We may be adversely impacted on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. In addition, coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our foreign customers’ local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to our customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality and characteristics, transportation costs and reliability of supply. Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry and foreign coal consumers. These coal consumption patterns are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, including demand for electricity, which is significantly dependent upon economic activity and summer and winter temperatures in the United States, government regulation, technological developments and the location, quality, price and availability of competing sources of fuel.
Indirect competition from natural gas-fired plants that are relatively more efficient, less expensive to construct and less difficult to permit than coal-fired plants has the most potential to displace a significant amount of coal-fired electric power generation in the near term, particularly from older, less efficient coal-fired powered generators. Federal and state mandates for increased use of electricity derived from renewable energy sources could affect demand for our coal. Such mandates, combined with other incentives to use renewable energy sources, such as tax credits, could make alternative fuel sources more competitive with coal. 
22

Laws and Regulations
Overview
Our coal mining operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety regulations. Regulations relating to our operations require us to obtain permits and other licenses; reclaim and restore our properties after mining operations have been completed; store, transport and dispose of materials used or generated by our operations; manage surface subsidence from underground mining; control water and air emissions; protect wetlands and endangered plant and wildlife; and to ensure employee health and safety. Furthermore, the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which could affect demand for our coal.
Compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of coal mining, and the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on our coal mining operations or our customers’ ability to use our coal and may require us or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we and our customers’ business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position.
Environmental Laws
Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of coal mining operations, both directly and indirectly. The CAA directly impacts our coal mining operations through permitting and emission control requirements for the construction or modification of certain facilities. Indirectly. the CAA affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers.
Coal impurities are released into the air when coal is burned and the CAA regulates specific emissions, such as sulfur and mercury. These regulations restricting emissions from coal-fired electric generating plants increase the costs to operate and could affect demand for coal as a fuel source, therefore potentially affecting the volume of our sales. Moreover, additional environmental regulations increase the likelihood that existing coal-fired electric generating plants will be decommissioned, including plants to which the Company sells coal, and reduce the likelihood that new coal-fired plants will be built in the future.
Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule. In 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) promulgated or finalized several rules for New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) for coal and oil-fired power plants. NSPS are technology-based standards that vary depending on the particular source, such as a coal-fired electric generating plant, and can have a significant influence on the cost of using coal as a fuel source. The EPA's 2012 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule (“MATS Rule”) established NSPS for coal-fired electric generating units particulate matter (“PM”), sulfur dioxide (“SO2”) and nitrogen oxides (“NOX”). The MATS Rule also established national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (“NESHAP”) for coal-fired electric generating units for certain impurities such as mercury. Unlike pollutants regulated by an NSPS, pollutants regulated by a NESHAP require the maximum achievable control technology (“MACT”) be used to control emissions of the pollutant.The application of a MACT standard is generally more costly than other control technology standards, and prompted the closure of some facilities. The rule was challenged, ultimately rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 29, 2015 for failing to consider the costs imposed by the MATS Rule, and remanded to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) to determine whether to allow the EPA to address the rule’s deficiencies or to vacate and nullify the rule. In April 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request to stay the case to allow the agency to fully review the rule. Nevertheless, many coal-fired electric power generators have already taken steps to comply with the MATS Rule as such required control and operational modifications can take significant time to install and/or implement. On December 28, 2018, the EPA proposed to revise the 2016 supplemental cost finding for the MATS Rule, as well as the related risk and technology review required by the CAA. Under the proposal, the emissions standards and other requirements of the MATS Rule would remain in place while the EPA's methodology for assessing the costs and benefits of the rule were being modified. 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CAA requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for six pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment (“Criteria Pollutants”). In recent years, the EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for these Criteria Pollutants, which could directly or indirectly impact mining operations through the identification of new non-attainment areas which could prompt local changes to permitting or emissions control requirements, as prescribed by federally mandated state implementation plans. The primary NAAQS set the permissible level of a particular Criteria Pollutant in the ambient air. In 2015, the EPA finalized the NAAQS for ozone pollution and reduced the limit to 70 parts per billion (ppb) from the previous 75 ppb standard. The final rule was challenged in the D.C. Circuit. On April 7, 2017, the EPA advised the D.C. Circuit that it intended to reconsider the final rule and the Court subsequently stayed the 
23

litigation pending further action by the EPA. In August 2018, the EPA ultimately decided not to revisit the rule. As a result, the D.C. Circuit lifted its stay of the 2015 ozone NAAQS rule imposing the 70 ppb ambient air quality standard.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (“CSAPR”). CSAPR regulates cross-border emissions of criteria air pollutants such as SO2 and NOX, particulate matter (“PM2.5”) and ozone by requiring states to limit emissions from sources that “contribute significantly” to noncompliance with air quality standards. If the ambient levels of criteria air pollutants are above the thresholds set by the EPA, a region is considered to be in “nonattainment” for that pollutant and the EPA applies more stringent control standards for sources of air emissions located in the region. Implementation of CSAPR is being accomplished in phases: Phase 1 began in 2015 and Phase 2 began in 2017. In September 2016, the EPA finalized revisions to the CSAPR. As of May 2017, this rule limits summertime NOX emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States, which may have an impact on how coal-fired electric-generating units are utilized in this region.
Clean Power Plan. On September 20, 2013, the EPA issued a new proposal, “Carbon Pollution Standard for New Power Plants”, to establish separate NSPS for CO2 emissions for natural gas-fired turbines and coal-fired units. This rule was finalized in late 2015, immediately challenged by multiple parties and in August 2017, was stayed by the D.C. Circuit to allow the Trump Administration's EPA to review the rule.
In June 2014, the EPA announced its Clean Power Plan (“CPP”) intended to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants and published a proposed rule for public comment. Under the CPP, the EPA would create emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to address greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) - predominantly through CO2 emissions reductions - from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. However, following numerous challenges to the CPP, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the effective date of the CPP. Subsequently, on October 16, 2017, the EPA formally proposed repeal of the CPP and later solicited comments on CO2 control measures that can be implemented at coal-fired electricity generating facilities.
In August 2018, the EPA released a proposed rule to replace the CPP: the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule. The ACE rule sets GHG guidelines for states to ultimately establish emissions limits and standards for existing coal-fired electric generating facilities. The proposed ACE rule is less stringent than the CPP, as it does not establish emission reduction standards or targets for states; rather, the rule proposes a list of technologies that states can use to establish standards of performance for power generating units within their jurisdiction. The EPA projects the ACE rule to result in no change in total electric generating capacity, and increased coal production for power sector use by 2025.
National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to taking a “major Federal action”, which encompasses agencies' decisions on our permitting applications and adoption of land management actions.When we propose activities that fall under federal jurisdiction, we are subject to NEPA reviews, which may create delays in project review and authorization timeframes, or increase the cost of compliance. In April 2017, pursuant to executive order, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) - the federal agency charged with overseeing implementation of NEPA - withdrew its “Final Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate Change in National Environmental Policy Act Reviews.” This guidance previously directed agencies to consider proposed actions' effects on climate change (including GHGs emission), and may have created additional delays and costs in the NEPA review process for the energy industry that are now no longer in place. Additionally, pursuant to Executive Order 13807 issued in August 2017, the CEQ has issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on NEPA that seeks to streamline the NEPA process, while also minimizing unnecessary litigation, cost, and delay for project proponents. The CEQ's proposed revisions to NEPA have yet to be updated, though the comment period for the rulemaking closed in August 2018. Nevertheless, certain Federal courts have held that GHGs must be considered under NEPA prior to a federal agency taking a “major Federal action.”
Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and corresponding state laws affect our coal operations by regulating discharges into certain waters, primarily through permitting. CWA permits - issued either by the EPA or an analogous state agency - typically require regular monitoring and compliance with limitations on defined pollutants and reporting requirements. Specific to the Company's operations, CWA permits and corresponding state laws often require (1) treatment of discharges from coal mining properties for non-traditional pollutants, such as chlorides, selenium and dissolved solids and (2) requirements to dispose of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes at approved disposal facilities. 
In order to obtain a permit for certain coal mining activities, including the construction of coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments, an operator may need to obtain a permit for the discharge of fill material from the Army Corps of Engineers (“ACOE”) and/or a discharge permit from the state regulatory authority under the state counterpart to the CWA. Beginning in early 2009, the EPA took a number of initiatives that have resulted in delays and obstruction of the issuance of such permits for surface mining operations in the Appalachian states, including Pennsylvania where the Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located. Increased oversight of delegated state programmatic authority, coupled with individual permit review and additional requirements 
24

imposed by the EPA, has resulted in delays in the review and issuance of permits. In addition, the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) requirements of the CWA apply to all our operations that use or produce oil and require the implementation of plans to address any spills and the installation of secondary containment around all storage tanks. These requirements under the CWA and SPCC may cause us to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.
Additionally, which waterbodies are subject to the CWA has been in dispute for years. In June 2015, the EPA issued a rule to clarify which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction under the CWA, known as the Clean Water Rule. This rule was quickly challenged and nationwide implementation was blocked by a federal appeals court. The Clean Water Rule would impose additional permitting obligations on the Company's operations by increasing the number of waterbodies subject to CWA permitting and other regulations. On February 28, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order prompting the EPA and ACOE to consider replacing the blocked Clean Water Rule. On December 11, 2018, the EPA and the ACOE proposed a new regulation to determine which waterbodies are subject to federal jurisdiction. The new proposal would lessen the number of waterbodies subject to the CWA as compared to the Clean Water Rule.
On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards (“ELG”) rule, revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category, which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. On September 13, 2017, the EPA finalized a rule postponing for two years certain applicability dates for specific waste streams subject to the effluent limitations. The applicability date of the stricter effluent limits is the subject of on-going litigation. Nevertheless, the combined effect of the coal combustion residuals rule (“CCR Rule”) (discussed below) and ELG regulations has compelled power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and may force the closure of certain older existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining by imposing requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of certain wastes created throughout the coal mining process. Facilities where certain regulated wastes have been treated, stored or disposed of are subject to RCRA and may receive corrective action orders for instances of non-compliance. Compliance with these regulations and receiving corrective action orders could adversely affect our results, financial condition and cash flows. RCRA is particularly important in the coal industry because it regulates coal combustion residuals (“Residuals”) - byproducts of coal combustion. In April 2015, the EPA published Residuals regulations under RCRA for the disposal of Residuals from electric utilities and independent power producers. Importantly, Residuals are regulated under RCRA as “non-hazardous” waste and avoid the stricter, more costly, regulations under RCRA's “hazardous” waste rules. Notably, the CCR Rule does not apply to Residuals placed in active or abandoned underground or surface mines. In 2018, the EPA proposed two types of alternative performance standards related to Residuals disposal. As proposed, these alternative standards appear to be less stringent than the current CCR Rule. However, these alternatives have not been finalized. 
Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (“SMCRA”) establishes minimum environmental standards for operational mines as well as reclamation standards for reclaiming post-operational mined land. The U.S. Office of Surface Mining (“OSM”) is responsible for issuing permits applying these standards to individual mining operations. However, states that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of SMCRA and OSM's regulations and in many instances have done so. The Pennsylvania Mining Complex is located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs. In addition, SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The current per ton fee is $0.12 per ton for underground mined coal. This fee is currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2021.
Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. These bonds are provided by CONSOL Energy and are typically renewable on a yearly basis. Surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable. It is possible that surety-bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral therefor. Any failure by CONSOL Energy to maintain, or our inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws or the related collateral required by the bond issuers therefor, would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.
Endangered Species Act (“ESA”). The federal ESA and other related federal and state statutes protect species that have been classified as endangered or threatened with possible extinction. Protection of these species could prohibit or delay authorization of mining activities, or may place additional restrictions on our operations related to timbering, construction or vegetation. A 
25

number of species indigenous to our operating areas are protected under the ESA; however, we do not believe the ESA would materially or adversely affect our mining operations under current approved mining plans. If more stringent or protective measures were required, or if additional critical habitat areas were designated, our operations could be exposed to additional requirements and expense, or delayed approval timeframes.
Other Environmental Regulations. We are required to comply with other state, federal and local environmental laws in addition to those discussed above. These laws include, for example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, the Toxic Release Inventory, and the rules governing the use and storage of explosives regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the Department of Homeland Security.
Health and Safety Laws
Mine Safety. Legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment, construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas, and engage in additional training. We have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols and with new regulations the volume of civil penalties has increased. Recent actions taken by federal and state governments include requiring:

• | the caching of additional supplies of self-contained self-rescuer devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground;


• | the purchase and installation of proximity detection devices on continuous miner machines;


• | the placement of refuge chambers, which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible, which will provide breathable air for 96 hours;


• | the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground;


• | additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees;


• | more stringent rock dusting requirements; and


• | the purchase of personal dust monitors for collecting respirable dust samples from certain miners.

On September 2, 2015, MSHA published proposed rules for underground coal mining operations concerning proximity detection systems for coal hauling machines and scoops. The rulemaking record for this proposed rule was closed on December 15, 2016, but on January 9, 2017, MSHA published a notice reopening the record and extending the comment period for this proposed rule for 30 days. MSHA extended the comment period again until April 10, 2017. MSHA has not issued a final rule regarding these proposed rules.
On January 15, 2015, MSHA published a final rule requiring underground coal mine operations to equip continuous mining machines, except full-face continuous mining machines, with proximity detection systems. The proximity detection system strengthens protection for miners by reducing the potential of pinning, crushing and striking hazards that result in accidents involving life-threatening injuries and death. The final rule became effective March 16, 2015 and included a phased in schedule for newly manufactured and in-service equipment.
In 2010, MSHA rolled out the “End Black Lung, Act Now” initiative. As a result, MSHA implemented a new final rule on August 1, 2014 to lower miners’ exposure to respirable coal mine dust including using the new Personal Dust Monitor technology. This final rule was implemented in three phases. The first phase began on August 1, 2014 and utilized the current gravimetric sampling device to take full shift dust samples from the current designated occupations and areas. It also required additional record keeping and immediate corrective action in the event of overexposure. The second phase began on February 1, 2016 and required additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor (“CPDM”) technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner. CPDM equipment was purchased and was placed into service which was required to meet compliance with the new rule. Dust Coordinators and Dust Technicians were hired in order to meet the staffing demand to manage compliance with the new rule. The final phase of the rule went into effect on August 1, 2016. The current respirable dust standard was reduced from 2.0 to 1.5mg/m3 for designated occupations and from 1.0 to 0.5mg/m3 for Part 90 Miners (coal miners who show evidence of the development of black lung disease).

Black Lung Legislation. Under federal black lung benefits legislation, each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to:

• | current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease;


• | certain survivors of miners who have died from black lung disease; and


• | a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before January 1, 1970, where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims (where a coal miner's last coal employment was after December 31, 1969), or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment

26

of such benefits. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of coal, at a 2018 rate of up to $1.10 per ton for deep mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price. On January 1, 2019, the excise tax levels reverted back to $0.50 per ton for deep mined coal and $0.25 per ton for surface-mined coal, capped at 2% of the coal's selling price.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) of 2010 made two changes to the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. First, it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least 15 years in underground coal mines, or in similar conditions, and suffer from a totally disabling lung disease. To rebut this presumption, a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner's work. Second, it changed the law so black lung benefits will continue to be paid to dependent survivors when the miner passes away, regardless of the cause of the miner's death. The changes have increased the cost to us of complying with the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act. In addition to the federal legislation, we are also liable under various state statutes for our portion of black lung claims.
Other State and Local Laws Related to Our Coal Business
Ownership of Coal Rights. The Company acquires ownership or leasehold rights to coal properties prior to conducting operations on those properties. As is customary in the coal industry, we have generally conducted only a summary review of the title to coal rights that are not in our development plans, but which we believe we control. This summary review is conducted at the time of acquisition or as part of a review of our land records to determine control of coal rights. Given our experience as a coal producer, we believe we have a well-developed ownership position relating to our coal control. Prior to the commencement of development operations on coal properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. We generally will not commence operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property. We are typically responsible for the cost of curing any title defects. We have completed title work on substantially all of our coal producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry. 
Permits
Environmental Proceedings. During the summer of 2014, certain environmental groups instituted litigation before the Pennsylvania Environmental Hearing Board (“EHB”), challenging certain longwall mining permitting at the Bailey Mine. Following a hearing in August 2016, the EHB issued a decision in August 2017 rejecting the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (“DEP”) requirement that CONSOL Pennsylvania Coal Company LLC install synthetic stream-channel liner systems in a stream overlying a portion of the Bailey Mine. On September 4, 2017, the DEP provided notice that it required additional time to review the technical merits of a permit application for continued longwall mining within the 4L panel under Polen Run at the Bailey Mine. As a result, the longwall was idled at that time and workforce adjustments were made, pending further developments with the DEP and permit submission. This was the first time in the 35-year history of the Bailey Mine that a needed mining permit had not been received in a timely fashion. 
The longwall was moved and resumed operations the first week of October 2017. Our management implemented several measures to mitigate the production impact from this delay, including working additional unscheduled shifts as compared to the previous five and a half day schedule. Our management continued to take steps to mitigate the production impact from this delay and worked closely with the necessary agencies to obtain operating permits to allow for continuity of longwall mining operations. In November 2017, the DEP issued permitting authorizing revised longwall mining plans in the 5L Panel and longwall mining in Panels 6L through 8L. 
On March 21, 2018, Center for Coalfield Justice and Sierra Club (Appellants) appealed the application. On November 28, 2018 the Appellants withdrew their notice of appeal and the EHB marked the docket closed and discontinued. The Bailey East (L longwall panel area) is no longer in litigation.
The Pennsylvania Mining Complex operates five total longwalls, with many of the approved permits as far out as ten years in advance.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 1,772 employees, of which 28 CONSOL Marine Terminal employees were represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
