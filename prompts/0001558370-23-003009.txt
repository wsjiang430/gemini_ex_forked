ITEM 1          BUSINESS
Corporate History and Background
Monocle Acquisition Corporation (“Monocle”) was initially formed as a Delaware corporation on August 20, 2018 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
On December 22, 2020, (the “Closing Date”), Monocle consummated the previously announced business combination pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 8, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Monocle, AerSale Corporation (f/k/a Monocle Holdings Inc.), a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), AerSale Aviation, Inc. (f/k/a AerSale Corp.), a Delaware corporation (“AerSale Aviation”), Monocle Merger Sub 1 Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Merger Sub 1”), Monocle Merger Sub 2 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Merger Sub 2”), and Leonard Green & Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as the initial Holder Representative (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are referred to herein as the “Merger” or the “Business Combination” and in connection therewith, Monocle merged with and into us, whereby we survived the merger and became the successor issuer to Monocle by operation of Rule 12g-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Upon the consummation of the Merger: (a) Merger Sub 1 was merged with and into Monocle, with Monocle surviving the merger as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Company (the “First Merger”), and (b) Merger Sub 2 was merged with and into AerSale Aviation, with AerSale Aviation surviving the merger as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (the “Second Merger”). In connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), AerSale Aviation changed its name from “AerSale Corp.” to “AerSale Aviation, Inc.” and the Company changed its name from “Monocle Holdings Inc.” to “AerSale Corporation.” Immediately following the Merger, the Company contributed all of its ownership in Monocle to AerSale Aviation, which continued as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
Overview of Business and Operations
Our mission is to provide full-service support to owners and operators of mid-life commercial aircraft who lack the infrastructure and/or expertise to cost effectively maintain such aircraft during the second half of their operating life through their retirement from service. By providing a one-stop shop that integrates multiple service and product offerings, we save our customers time and money, while providing value to our stockholders through our operating efficiency. We were founded in 2008 by Nicolas Finazzo and Robert B. Nichols as a platform to serve the aviation aftermarket. In early 2010, we partnered with private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. to scale our business and finance the creation of a purpose built and fully integrated aviation company. Since our founding, we have established a global footprint and scalable platform for growth.




Our business is comprised of two reporting segments: Asset Management Solutions and Technical Operations (“TechOps”), which, taken together, provide comprehensive support to owners and operators of used commercial aircraft.
Asset Management Solutions
Our Asset Management Solutions segment, which represented approximately 68% of our revenue during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, acquires mid-life commercial aircraft and engines (“Flight Equipment”) from airlines and leasing companies as feedstock to support our business activities. Asset Management Solutions activities include the sale and lease of aircraft and engines, as well as the disassembly of these assets for component parts (such used serviceable material, “USM”) that can be utilized to support third-party sales and lower the cost to maintain our portfolio of leased assets. Our aircraft and engines generally provide highly customized full-service, short-term lease support, where an operator is provided with a turn-key piece of Flight Equipment that can meet the customer’s specific needs. Our business model provides an alternative to the procurement of new aircraft, engines and parts traditionally sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) or delivered new and leased by pure-play aircraft and engine leasing companies. Because we have created the infrastructure to market through alternative channels, we are able to maximize financial returns on Flight Equipment by cost-effectively placing such assets in the secondary market for the balance of their operating life, and upon retirement from service, extracting their greatest residual value by disassembling Flight Equipment assets to the piece-part level for re-use as USM. We do this by utilizing our integrated business units to maximize the sum of each asset’s alternative revenue streams, ranging from their sale or lease as whole operating assets, down to utilizing their collective individual components to serve as USM feedstock or to lower our leasing and operating costs related to MRO services. We also offer our integrated Asset Management Solutions services to third-party clients who lack the expertise and/or infrastructure to optimize their Flight Equipment investments. We lease engines and airframes primarily as a means of extracting value from the remaining operating life of an asset prior to disassembly for USM parts. We focus primarily on highly customized aircraft leases or short-term engine leasing where we can demand a lease premium, and we utilize our USM and MRO capabilities to fully meet all maintenance needs, which allow us to fully monetize collected maintenance reserves. After disassembly, we utilize the pieces as low-cost spare parts feedstock to support our various other business segments, including USM part sales, and in conjunction with our third-party maintenance operations. Consequently, the vast majority of aircraft and engines that we have acquired have ultimately been disassembled for their USM parts once the full value of their remaining operating life has been extracted.
TechOps
Our TechOps segment, which represented approximately 32% of our revenue during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, provides nose-to-tail MRO services on the most popular commercial aircraft, engines and components, that serve the passenger, cargo, and government sectors. Through our collective U.S.-based MRO facilities, we provide extensive maintenance and modification services for aircraft and their individual components. Our aircraft facilities located in Goodyear, Arizona, and Roswell, New Mexico, combined feature approximately 650,000 square feet of hangar space, from which we provide high-quality airframe MRO services, structural modification, conversions, and flight system upgrades, including disassembly and re-cycling operations for retiring aircraft. We additionally offer convenient long-term storage capacity for up to 650 aircraft in ideal dry-desert conditions.
At the individual component level, our facilities located in Miami, Florida, Rio Rancho, New Mexico, and Memphis, Tennessee collectively offer specialized component MRO capabilities and services covering hydraulics, composites, pneumatics, fuel systems, electro-mechanical assemblies, interiors, painting, flight controls, nacelles, and landing gear for passenger, cargo, and military aircraft applications.
Our TechOps segment leverages its robust engineering team to provide highly specialized technical support to our MRO facilities, as well as to develop advanced technical repairs, modifications and products, which we market under the tradename “Engineered Solutions.” This business unit includes the design, manufacture, and installation of new products, systems, and services that can enhance aircraft performance, safety, and service life at lower costs than traditionally expensive OEM products and services. Engineered Solutions also serves to lower the cost of Flight Equipment ownership with savings on MRO-related expenses, including compliance with mandatory and market-driven equipment upgrades. These cost-saving solutions are approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) under Supplemental Type Certificates (“STCs”), which provides us with the unique ability to perform these modifications. We use our FAA-




approved Parts Manufacturing Authority (“PMA”) to integrate third party components in developing our STC solutions. We have also obtained approval from various foreign regulatory authorities to validate our STCs and PMA products for use by operators outside of the United States.
One example of our Engineered Solutions is our AerSafe ® product line. We designed and received FAA approval to market AerSafe ® as a solution for compliance with an FAA mandate to mitigate aircraft fuel tank flammability on Boeing and Airbus aircraft. AerSafe ® has also been approved for installation on certain aircraft models that are regulated by the European Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”) and the National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil.
Competition
The aviation aftermarket is highly competitive with many participants, including Flight Equipment OEMs, MRO providers, airlines, aircraft and engine leasing companies, financial sponsors, USM sales organizations, and other independent manufacturers and service providers. The vast majority of participants compete within smaller subsets of our broader products and services offerings. Frequently, our competitors specialize in one or a limited number of areas within the following segments: aircraft MRO, engine MRO, Engineered Solutions, aircraft leasing, engine leasing, USM part sales, and asset management. Further, many component MRO providers specialize in a small subset of repairs related to specific components or materials, such as composites, pneumatics, hydraulics, electronics, landing gear, wheels and brakes, and auxiliary power units.
Consumers of aftermarket Flight Equipment products and services typically make buying decisions based on a variety of factors including quality, pricing, availability, provider reputation, technical specification, prior operating history, turnaround time, geographic location and financial terms.
Our Asset Management Solutions segment competitors include AAR Corp., AerCap, Delta Air Lines, Inc., GA Telesis, LLC, Kellstrom Aerospace, Heico Corporation, Willis Lease Finance Corp, Air Transport Services Group, LLC, Unical Aviation, Inc, Satair Group and Aviall, Inc, while competitors to our TechOps segment include AAR Corp., Aviation Technical Services, Inc., HAECO Americas, MRO Holdings, Inc., ST Engineering North America, Air Transport Services Group, LLC, Delta TechOps, TransDigm Group, MTU Aero Engines, Woodward, Inc., and Lufthansa Technik AG. Though our product and service offerings include certain aircraft and engine leasing activities, we do not view large pure-play aircraft and engine leasing companies as core competitors, as those companies are primarily centered around cost of capital and financial securitization products, and frequently choose to divest mid-life assets as they lack the technical and mechanical capabilities to deal with assets that have exited the OEM warranty periods.
Certain of our competitors have substantially greater marketing, financial, technical and infrastructure resources than we do, and may additionally provide complementary sales and services capabilities that we do not currently offer. As a result, certain of our competitors may be able to deliver a broader range of aftermarket Flight Equipment products and services at more attractive pricing. As such, we choose to target services and products where our synergic capabilities provide us a competitive advantage and allow us to be more responsive to the evolving needs of mid-life aircraft owners, operators, MRO providers and financial sponsors. We believe that the market insights, technical capabilities and financial expertise that we bring together through our Asset Management Solutions and TechOps offerings are particularly well suited to meet the comprehensive needs of mid-life Flight Equipment customers, with a fuller range of value-added products and services than most of our competitors.
Competitive Strengths
Our competitive strengths are focused on institutionalized processes to drive profitability by maximizing Flight Equipment values across the second half of their life cycle. We believe our data-driven approach, highly attuned staff, proprietary analytical tools, and formalized decision-making processes give us a unique platform to drive value within the aviation aftermarket.
Our ability to provide cost saving alternatives to support our customers across the entire range of Flight Equipment, from whole aircraft down to the individual component parts level, is crucial to our ability to maximize value and profitability. By offering a comprehensive suite of products and services, we are able to enjoy a competitive edge in 




the marketplace as a “one-stop” source for full aircraft, engine and USM spare parts support, bundled with comprehensive MRO solutions. This integration of services facilitates significant cross-selling opportunities among our various business units, as many of our customers depend on the products and services provided by both our Asset Management Solutions and TechOps business segments. In totality, the breadth of these capabilities allows us to optimally service our customers’ needs, providing them increased fleet flexibility while reducing downtime. Similarly, these capabilities lower the cost of ownership of our own Flight Equipment. At the same time, our participation in upstream aircraft and engine transactions also provides valuable market insights regarding operating fleet trends that feed our key downstream supply and demand modeling inputs, enhancing our MRO and USM parts investment decisions.
As a consistent source of aftermarket USM parts, we provide our customers with a safe and widely-accepted low-cost alternative to purchasing new OEM replacement parts. Our ability to cost-efficiently source USM parts through aftermarket Flight Equipment acquisitions and lease portfolio retirements enables us to profitably monetize aircraft and engines that otherwise would have limited economic benefit as an operating whole asset. We are additionally able to leverage our component MRO capabilities to extend the serviceable life of many USM components and systems. Consequently, our ability to increase our USM return to service yield reduces our associated return to service expenses and serves to drive incremental margin on USM part sales, while also lowering the cost of replacement parts required to maintain our portfolio aircraft and engines.
We have a competitive advantage over most of our MRO competitors as one of the select aviation aftermarket companies that has the necessary technical and operational resources to hold FAA “unlimited” repair station ratings for both our airframe and component MRO operations. These comprehensive FAA ratings are no longer granted; however, our unlimited ratings were “grandfathered” and are held by our longstanding MRO subsidiary companies. This enables us to fast track the implementation of certain new MRO capabilities through an established FAA approved “self-certification” procedure, while avoiding the typically longer approval lead-times associated with standard FAA repair station capability certification. Consequently, we believe our ability to efficiently innovate and bring to market new proprietary repairs and modifications for both aircraft and their components meaningfully enhances our responsiveness to the evolving needs of our customers, while also giving us the flexibility to pursue a significantly wider range of market growth opportunities.
Growth Strategies
We intend to pursue opportunities that are well aligned with our existing capabilities, which will continue to differentiate our business.

● | Broaden our MRO Capabilities. We plan to utilize our FAA “unlimited” repair station licenses to develop new capabilities, while augmenting brand loyalty with a growing range of MRO services to support our customers’ needs. The MRO segment is accretive to our Asset Management Solutions business and provides incremental opportunities to supplement our MRO customers with Flight Equipment and USM spare parts once we have established an initial MRO service relationship.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand Our Government Presence. Many of the commercial aircraft and engines for which we provide products and services have equivalent or derivative aircraft and engine platforms that are used by various branches of the military and civilian government agencies. As government funding is stable and uncorrelated with the commercial aviation cycle, we view this as an important growth market. We intend to increasingly focus on capturing additional USM parts sales in addition to MRO service opportunities, directly with these government customers, or through subcontracting arrangements with government contractors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Introduce New Engineered Solutions. Our Engineered Solutions offerings provide a critical value-add for customers through the introduction of proprietary alternative products, repairs and modifications which we develop to enhance aircraft performance, reliability, safety, regulatory compliance, service life, and cost-of-ownership economics. The breadth of services and capabilities that we provide our extensive customer base promotes our early identification and development of new solutions to address their evolving needs. We plan to continue to invest in new Engineered Solutions that create value for our customers and are accretive to the expansion and profitability of our MRO operations. We believe that we are well positioned to develop and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


market these solutions given our deep knowledge of maintenance intensive mid-life aircraft, our broad range of engineering and MRO capabilities, and our extended market reach as a global provider of Flight Equipment sales, leasing, MRO and USM parts sales.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand Our Geographical Footprint. We believe the growth in the international aviation sector represents a compelling opportunity to leverage our existing capabilities to serve a broader set of foreign aircraft owners, operators, OEMs and MRO customers. As international fleets continue to grow in size and age in both established and emerging markets, we expect to play an increasing role in supplying Flight Equipment spares, MRO support, and USM parts to burgeoning markets that currently lack a mature infrastructure to meet this demand.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Our business has grown organically and through acquisitions since our founding. We have a proven track record of successfully expanding our capabilities through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Great Southwest Aviation (rebranded as AerSale - Roswell) in 2010, Aero Mechanical Industries (rebranded as AerSale Landing Gear Solutions) in 2015, Goodyear Maintenance Facility in 2017 (rebranded as AerSale – Goodyear), Avborne Accessory Group (rebranded as AerSale Component Solutions) in 2018, Qwest Air Parts in 2019, Q2 Aviation (rebranded as AerSale AeroStructures-Memphis) in 2019 and Aircraft Composite Technologies (rebranded as AerSale AeroStructures-Miami) in 2020. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses that meet our financial return profile and execute on these transactions where there is an opportunity to enhance our value proposition by integrating the operations of such businesses into our existing offerings of products and services.

Customers
We sell to more than 1,000 customers worldwide. Non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenue for 2022. Our principal customers are comprised of domestic and foreign passenger airlines, cargo operators and governmental agencies. We also sell our products and services to a broad range of companies that provide aftermarket Flight Equipment support services, including OEMs, MRO providers, financial sponsors and leasing companies.
We believe that the breadth of our MRO capabilities and supporting services create a compelling customer care and value proposition that fosters brand loyalty, and significantly contributes to the recurring nature of our business. In the year ended December 31, 2022, seven of our top ten customers by revenue had been customers for five years or more, and 54% of revenue from our top 100 customers was sales from customers utilizing more than one of our service offerings.
We primarily use the US Dollar as our functional currency in all markets in which we operate in order to reduce our foreign currency market risk.
Sales and Marketing
We employ a sales force of 36 individuals. We utilize a matrixed marketing approach, where our individual business segments dedicate resources to market directly to their respective customer audience, while our regional sales specialists co-market our combined product and service offerings to clients within their territories. Given the technical nature of our business, business unit-specific technical staff frequently participate in marketing presentations and campaign developments in support of marketing initiatives spanning the sale, lease and MRO of aircraft, engines and their components.
We primarily market and sell our products and services through our direct sales force. On occasion, we utilize contract services to assist in specific client-targeted sales efforts. In addition, we utilize foreign representation in certain regional markets outside of the United States. We augment our direct customer marketing efforts with industry event sponsorships, conference participation, press release broadcast, web site promotion and social media initiatives, in addition to trade publication announcements, advertising and periodical article contributions.



Research and Development
We embrace a customer centric approach to supporting our clients with new value-add products and services designed to enhance Flight Equipment performance, lower the cost of maintenance, improve reliability and extend service life, while reducing the associated cost-of-ownership. Key initiatives to support our customers’ reduced cost of ownership include reduced down-time, lower cost USM alternatives, Flight Equipment lease versus own options, innovative aircraft modification and upgrade services, and propriety component repair regimes.
Because our customers utilize our entire range of services, from whole aircraft MRO through individual component MRO, we frequently receive valuable insights as to evolving customer needs and desires. These inputs are regularly provided to our senior managers and technical personnel to identify and quantify opportunities for developing new products and services. Where the business case warrants, our engineers and technicians are tasked to develop, test and introduce new Engineered Solutions, including proprietary repairs not identified in existing repair manuals, and STCs for new products designed to provide value to our customers.
Our ability to bring new Engineered Solutions to market is made possible through our in-depth knowledge of the requirements promulgated by respective airworthiness regulatory agencies like the FAA, in addition to non-mandatory recommendations issued by OEMs. The engineering and regulatory authority certification process varies widely by product application and region, and we look to contract with third-party manufacturers and/or channel partners on an as-needed basis to assist in obtaining certain regulatory agency approvals.
We believe that our “unlimited” airframe and component FAA repair station certifications, PMA authority, and deep technical expertise position us to efficiently identify and implement new Engineered Solutions and proprietary component repairs, which is an important differentiator for our industry.
Government Regulation
The FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft, including engines, components and parts, operated in the United States, to ensure that all aircraft and aviation equipment are continuously maintained in proper condition for safe operation. Similar rules and regulatory authorities exist in other countries. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by these regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. Certification and conformance are required prior to installation of Flight Equipment components, including aircraft released into operating service. We operate six FAA/EASA certified repair stations, in addition to holding various other international airworthiness authority approvals, which are repair station facility specific. Our repair station facilities are required by the FAA to hold pertinent certification approvals for the products and MRO services that we provide for our customers, and we are required to adhere to all relevant FAA rules and regulations as a condition to maintaining those certifications.
Certain of our Engineered Solutions include products that are authorized by the FAA through issuance of STC approval for their respective application. Others involve proprietary repairs that we develop internally in compliance with authorities granted by the FAA under our “unlimited” repair station licensing for applicable airframe and engine component categories. We facilitate the production of certain of our Engineered Solutions through the manufacture of new parts in accordance with our FAA approved PMA certifications, as well as the manufacture of certain new replacement parts under our FAA repair station authorities. We also employ FAA certified personnel called, Designated Airworthiness Representatives and Designated Engineering Representatives, to facilitate our MRO operations through the development and regulatory approval of specialized airframe and component designs, repairs, modifications, and installations. We rely on these FAA approvals to market our Engineered Solutions to third parties, as well as to utilize them on our own Flight Equipment. We believe the depth of technical and operational qualifications required to attain these FAA regulatory approvals constitutes a significant barrier for competitors looking to compete with our Engineered Solutions offerings. One such product that is nearing STC is our offering designated as AerAwareTM. AerAware™ is an Advanced Enhanced Flight Vision System (“EFVS”) solution that enables a pilot to “see” through low visibility conditions by presenting advanced imaging technology along with real time aircraft primary flight systems data on an Elbit Systems/Universal Avionics SkyLens™ Head Wearable Display. The FAA has assigned STC project number 



ST16454AT-T for AerAware™, indicating the agency’s acceptance of AerSale’s STC application and for which we are conducting certification flights.
​
The FAA requires that aircraft operators maintain detailed records that log the utilization and condition of certain aircraft and engine life-limited parts. The FAA also requires that various maintenance routines be performed and documented on certain airframe and engine components at regular intervals based on utilization and/or time. Maintenance may also be required following certain types of events (e.g., foreign object damage, extreme heat, hard landings, etc.). Further, the FAA and certain other airworthiness authorities can at any time introduce new rules and regulations that may impact our business. In order to proactively mitigate the effects of prospective future rulings and amendments, as well as to position our business segments to potentially benefit from them, we diligently monitor FAA publications and industry trade groups in an effort to obtain as much advance notice as possible concerning future regulatory mandates.
As we pursue sales of products and services directly to government customers or through subcontracting arrangements with government contractors, we may also be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing, reporting, and other factors. Historically, government regulations have had no material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Intellectual Property
We believe our brand recognition is an important differentiator, and we maintain trademarks on “AerSale”, and on certain branded product offerings (e.g., AerSale® active into 2031, AerSafe® active into 2031, AerTrak® active into 2024).
While we hold no patents, we significantly benefit from an extensive array of proprietary intellectual property pertaining to market intelligence, transactional data history, and price modeling techniques, in addition to a wide range of product design, engineering, manufacturing, repair, modification and MRO procedures.
Our Engineered Solutions are trade secrets comprised of internally developed proprietary products and repair regimes. As such, our Engineered Solutions are exclusively available through our business or third parties that we authorize. While our competitors may be able to develop similar alternatives to our Engineered Solutions offerings, we believe that our deep understanding of mid-life aircraft markets and technologies, combined with our ability to expedite the introduction of new Engineered Solutions to the market, uniquely positions us to increase our market share in this sector.
Though our proprietary market intelligence, transactional data history, price modeling techniques, and Engineered Solutions expertise are subject to misappropriation or obsolescence, we believe we have adequately institutionalized systems and procedures to prevent such occurrences. These measures include adoption of continuous improvement methodologies developed to maintain the integrity of our intellectual property holdings, in addition to the innovation of new techniques, products and processes designed to enhance our existing offerings in response to future market developments.
Human Capital Resources
As of February 7, 2023, we employed 606 full-time employees worldwide, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Approximately 99% of our employees are based in the United States. In addition to our full-time employees, we also employ approximately 254 contract workers, the majority of whom are located at our airframe maintenance facilities where they provide us with flexible staffing to meet customer demand.
Our success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to succeed. We require highly skilled personnel in multiple areas, including engineering, project management, aircraft technicians, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy, and management.




In order to attract and retain highly skilled employees, we are committed to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment, offering competitive compensation and comprehensive benefit programs, creating great career opportunities, and building an engaging, inclusive environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect.
Health and Safety
We have established safety and awareness programs in each AerSale facility. To maintain and enhance the safety of our employees, we promote a culture of continuous improvement and individual accountability. Each AerSale MRO facility has developed an Environmental Policy and Procedures Manual in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations.
We use an annual goal setting process to drive injury rate improvements, and our injury rate reduction goal is a performance metric that is reported to all of our employees.
The safety of our employees has been a priority throughout the COVID 19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our facility response teams implemented processes and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable government-imposed health and safety-related operating restrictions, enhanced the safety of our facilities, protected the health of our employees, and monitored trends in infection rates at locations where we have facilities. Many of these health and safety protocols have evolved to become more permanent fixtures in our workplace. We will continue to monitor public health announcements and government orders to accommodate additional changes as necessary. 
Talent Management and Career Development
At AerSale, our talent management & career development programs prepare our employees for a rewarding and challenging experience. We want to ensure that each of our employees has the tools they need to succeed in their current role, while preparing them for the next step in their career. Management and Leadership curriculums are tailored based on each facility’s unique needs as well as the individuals’ needs. At our MRO facilities we have established a career readiness program specifically for aspiring aviation mechanics and technicians. This program would allow individuals to start in an entry level role and through supervision, training, and mentorship complemented by our A&P reimbursement program, become an A&P mechanic or Inspector.
Our employees are encouraged to take advantage of our tuition reimbursement program to obtain professional and technical certifications or toward degree programs related to their career track. Our annual talent and performance review allows AerSale’s management team to identify emerging talent in the organization and develop a succession plan. By evaluating our workforce and needs we are able to provide opportunities for growth and professional fulfillment.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are a proud Equal Opportunity Employer. For over a decade, we have created employment opportunities in diverse communities. We believe that diversity is key to our success, and we foster a culture of inclusion. By creating an environment where employees feel embraced and appreciated, we believe that our employees will be motivated to excel and contribute to our continued success. We are confident that in leveraging our employee’s differences we can innovate and remain competitive in a dynamic and demanding industry.
We have a firm commitment to diversity and inclusion in our recruiting, hiring and promotion practices. Minority and female employees are encouraged to participate in career days, job fairs and programs in the communities in which we do business. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s employee base includes 23.8% females and 61.2% minorities. We actively engage in recruiting fairs and efforts at various training institutions, especially those that have high minority and diverse enrollment rates. We continue to work with local organizations to identify minorities with an increased focus on veterans who will be transitioning into the civilian workforce. In 2023, we aim to focus on partnering with local schools and supporting diverse students with an anticipated scholarship program that will provide financial assistance, mentorship and internship opportunities with the ultimate goal being full time employment at one of our facilities. In 2022, we conducted an employment survey to assess diversity efforts and measure progress on our commitment to fostering a culture 




of inclusion and diversity and ensuring employees can reach their potential. Each manager and leader is responsible for upholding these values and supporting the goals under our affirmative action plan.
Environmental Matters
Our business, operations and facilities are subject to numerous stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations by government agencies, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the emission, discharge, generation, management, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, pollutants and contaminants, govern public and private response actions to hazardous or regulated substances which may be or have been released to the environment, and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. Although management believes that our operations and our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations, future changes in these laws, regulations or interpretations thereof, the nature of our operations, or regulatory enforcement actions may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations and/or engage in remedial actions.
Certain of our facilities, including facilities acquired and operated by us or one of our subsidiaries, have at one time or another been under active investigation for environmental contamination by federal or state agencies. We are generally indemnified by prior owners or operators and/or present owners of the facilities for liabilities which we incur as a result of these investigations and the environmental contamination found which pre-dates our acquisition of these facilities, subject to certain limitations. For our Goodyear, AZ facility, we also maintain an environmental impairment liability policy that provides coverage for certain liabilities associated with the clean-up of on-site and off-site pollution conditions, as well as for resulting bodily injury or property damage to third parties, in each case, to the extent not otherwise indemnified. If we are required to pay the expenses related to environmental liabilities because neither indemnification nor insurance coverage is available, these expenses could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
