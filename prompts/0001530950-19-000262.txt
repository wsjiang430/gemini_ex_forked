ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Introduction
Post Holdings, Inc. is a Missouri corporation incorporated on September 22, 2011. Our principal executive offices are located at 2503 S. Hanley Road, St. Louis, Missouri 63144. We are a consumer packaged goods holding company, operating in the center-of-the-store, refrigerated, foodservice, food ingredient and convenient nutrition categories. We also participate in the private brand food category, including through our investment with affiliates of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (collectively, “THL”) in 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. (“8th Avenue”). Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in this Form 10-K to “Post,” “the Company,” “us,” “our” or “we” mean Post Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
On February 3, 2012, Post completed its legal separation via a tax free spin-off from its former parent company. On February 6, 2012, Post common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “POST”. We operate in five reportable segments: 

• | Post Consumer Brands: Includes branded and private label ready-to-eat (“RTE”) cereal operations of Post Foods, LLC, MOM Brands Company (“MOM Brands”), which Post acquired in May 2015, and Weetabix North America (“Weetabix NA”), which Post acquired as part of its acquisition of Latimer Newco 2 Limited, a company registered in England and Wales (“Latimer”), and all of Latimer’s direct and indirect subsidiaries at the time of acquisition, including Weetabix Limited (collectively, the “Weetabix Group”), in July 2017;


• | Weetabix: Includes the businesses of Weetabix Limited and its direct subsidiaries, which produce and distribute branded and private label RTE cereal, hot cereals and other cereal-based food products, breakfast drinks and muesli primarily outside of North America, which Post acquired as part of its acquisition of the Weetabix Group in July 2017;


• | Foodservice: Includes primarily egg and potato products in the foodservice and food ingredient channels from the businesses of MFI Holding Corporation (“Michael Foods”), which Post acquired in June 2014, Willamette Egg Farms (“Willamette”), which Post acquired in October 2015, National Pasteurized Eggs, Inc. (“NPE”), which Post acquired in October 2016, and Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (“Bob Evans”), which Post acquired in January 2018;


• | Refrigerated Retail: Includes refrigerated retail products, inclusive of side dishes, eggs and egg, cheese and sausage products, from the businesses of Michael Foods, Willamette, NPE and Bob Evans; and


• | BellRing Brands (historically referred to as Active Nutrition): Provides products in the convenient nutrition category, including ready-to-drink (“RTD”) protein shakes, other RTD beverages, powders, nutrition bars and supplements, from the businesses of Premier Nutrition Company, LLC (formerly Premier Nutrition Corporation), which Post acquired in September 2013, Dymatize Enterprises, LLC (“Dymatize”), which Post acquired in February 2014, and the PowerBar brand, which Post acquired in October 2014, and includes Active Nutrition International GmbH, which manufactures and sells convenient nutrition products in certain international markets.

On October 21, 2019, the initial public offering (the “IPO”) of a minority interest in our historical Active Nutrition business was completed. As a result of the IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the IPO (the “formation transactions”), BellRing Brands, Inc. (“BellRing”) is a holding company owning 28.8% of the non-voting membership units (the “BellRing Brands, LLC units”) of BellRing Brands, LLC (formerly Dymatize Holdings, LLC) and a publicly-traded company whose Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “BRBR”. Post owns 71.2% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units and one share of BellRing’s Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share, which, for so long as Post or its affiliates (other than BellRing and its subsidiaries) directly own more than 50% of the BellRing Brands, LLC units, represents 67% of the combined voting power of the common stock of BellRing. BellRing Brands, LLC is the holding company for Post’s historical Active Nutrition business. Effective October 21, 2019, the financial results of BellRing and its subsidiaries will be consolidated within the Company’s financial results and 28.8% of the consolidated net income (loss) and net assets of BellRing and its subsidiaries, representing the percentage of economic interest in BellRing Brands, LLC held by BellRing (and therefore indirectly held by the public stockholders of BellRing through their ownership of the Class A Common Stock), will be allocated to noncontrolling interest. For additional information, refer to Note 25 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.
On October 1, 2018, Post separately capitalized 8th Avenue with THL. 8th Avenue became the holding company for Post’s private brands food products business, which was historically reported as Post’s Private Brands segment. After completion of the transaction, Post retained 60.5% of the common equity in 8th Avenue, which, effective October 1, 2018, is accounted for using the equity method and is no longer consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. The private brands business was no longer 
considered a reportable segment of Post as of October 1, 2018. For additional information, refer to Note 7 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.

Our Businesses
Post Consumer Brands 
Our Post Consumer Brands segment includes our North America cereal business which manufactures, markets and sells branded and private label RTE cereal and hot cereal products. The RTE cereal category is one of the most prominent categories in the food industry. According to Nielsen’s expanded All Outlets Combined (“xAOC”) information, the category was approximately $8.2 billion in sales for the 52-week period ended October 26, 2019. We have leveraged the strength of our brands, category expertise and over a century of institutional knowledge to create a diverse portfolio of cereals. Post Consumer Brands is the third largest seller of RTE cereals in the United States with a 20.4% branded share of retail dollar sales and a 22.8% branded share of retail pound sales for the 52-week period ended October 26, 2019, based on Nielsen’s xAOC information. Nielsen’s xAOC is representative of food, drug and mass merchandisers (including Walmart), some club retailers (including Sam’s Club and BJs), some dollar retailers (including Dollar General, Family Dollar and Fred’s Super Dollar) and military. Our RTE cereal brands include Honey Bunches of Oats, Pebbles, Oreo O’s, Hostess Donettes, Hostess Honey Bun, Great Grains, Grape-Nuts, Post Shredded Wheat, Oh’s, Honeycomb, Golden Crisp, Post Raisin Bran, Alpha-Bits, Shreddies, Malt-O-Meal branded bagged cereal and Mom’s Best.

The Post Consumer Brands business’s products are primarily manufactured through a flexible production platform at nine owned facilities in the United States and Canada. 
Weetabix
Our Weetabix segment primarily markets and distributes branded and private label RTE cereal products. According to Nielsen’s ScanTrack data, the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) cereals and breakfast drinks category was approximately £1.4 billion in sales for the 52-week period ended November 2, 2019. Weetabix holds the number two overall position for branded manufacturers in the U.K. cereals and breakfast drinks category according to Nielsen’s ScanTrack data for the 52-week period ended November 2, 2019. Its portfolio includes the Weetabix brand, which holds the number one brand position in the U.K. cereals and breakfast drinks category based on Nielsen’s ScanTrack data for the 52-week period ended November 2, 2019, as well as Alpen (the number one muesli brand in the U.K. according to Nielsen’s ScanTrack data for the 52-week period ended November 2, 2019), Weetos, Ready Brek and Weetabix On The Go. Nielsen’s ScanTrack data is representative of grocery, health and beauty and beverage purchases, collating data from, among others, major grocery stores, independent grocery chains, convenience stores and gas stations. Weetabix’s main markets are the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland, where Weetabix has deep relationships with all key retailers and key players in wholesale and foodservice. Weetabix also distributes products to multiple countries throughout the world, mainly through a network of third party distributors in the respective markets. Weetabix also has a growing business in emerging markets, such as China and Hong Kong, through the eCommerce channel. Additionally, Weetabix has operations in Africa through two joint ventures.
For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, cereal and granola products sold by our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments and the historical Private Brands segment (for fiscal 2018 and 2017 only) together contributed 40.4%, 37.6% and 37.6%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue.
Foodservice
Through our Foodservice segment, we primarily produce and distribute egg and potato products in the foodservice and food ingredient channels. We provide a broad portfolio of egg products under several brands, including Papetti’s and Abbotsford Farms, as well as potato products under several brands, including Simply Potatoes. Our operations include thirteen egg products production 
facilities in the United States, some of which are fully integrated, from the maintenance of laying flocks through the processing of egg products, and potato processing facilities in Maine, Minnesota, Nevada and Ohio. Several of these production facilities also produce products for our Refrigerated Retail segment.
Refrigerated Retail
Through our Refrigerated Retail segment, we produce and distribute side dishes, eggs and egg, cheese, sausage and other refrigerated products to retail customers. Our refrigerated side dish, potato and sausage products are marketed primarily under the Bob Evans, Bob Evans Farms, Simply Potatoes, Pineland Farms, Owens and Diner’s Choice brands; processing facilities for these products are located in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Texas. Our egg products are chiefly marketed under the Bob Evans Egg Whites (which is the successor to the All Whites brand), Better’n Eggs, Abbotsford Farms and Davidson’s Safest Choice brands, and are produced at facilities located in Minnesota and New Jersey, as well as several of our egg products production facilities that also produce products for our Foodservice segment. Our cheese and other dairy case products are marketed principally under the Crystal Farms brand, as well as the Crescent Valley, Westfield Farms and David’s Deli brands. We operate a facility in Wisconsin that processes and packages various cheese products for the Crystal Farms brand and for private label customers.
Eggs and egg products sold by our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments together for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 contributed 27.8%, 24.6% and 27.1%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue. 
BellRing Brands 
Our BellRing Brands segment markets and distributes RTD protein shakes, other RTD beverages, powders, nutrition bars and supplements in the convenient nutrition category under the Premier Protein, Dymatize, PowerBar, Supreme Protein and Joint Juice brands. The BellRing Brands segment’s products are primarily manufactured under co-manufacturing agreements at various third party facilities located in the United States and Europe. BellRing Brands also owns a facility in Germany that manufactures bars and gels primarily for the European Union (the “E.U.”) and the U.K. Our BellRing Brands products are primarily sold in the club, food, drug and mass and eCommerce channels, as well as the specialty and convenience channels. 
For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, protein-based products and supplements contributed 15.0%, 13.2% and 13.6%, respectively, to our consolidated revenue.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Each of our businesses has developed marketing strategies specific to its product lines. For certain of our products, we have consumer-targeted marketing campaigns, which include television, digital and print advertisements, coupon offers, co-marketing arrangements with complementary consumer product and entertainment companies and joint advertising with select retail customers. We also use traditional outdoor, print and digital advertising and social media, as well as more targeted grass roots programs such as sampling events and business drops, in order to increase brand awareness and loyalty at both national and local levels. Our internet and social media efforts are used to educate consumers about the nutritional value of our products and for product promotion and consumer entertainment. 
Our Post Consumer Brands segment sells products primarily through an internal sales staff and broker organizations. Our Weetabix segment services its key U.K. markets through a centralized commercial team which manages relationships with customers at the corporate level while a third party sales force operates at the store level to ensure maximum availability and compliance with agreed plans, and it services emerging markets, such as China and Hong Kong, through the eCommerce channel. Our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments sell and market their products primarily through dedicated teams of internal sales staff and broker organizations. Our BellRing Brands segment uses a flexible sales model that combines a national and international direct sales force, broker network and distributors. 
Generally our products are distributed through a network of third party common carriers. In addition, our Refrigerated Retail and Foodservice segments have internal fleets that distribute certain of their products.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts span our business segments. These capabilities extend to ingredients and packaging technologies; new product and process development, as well as analytical support; bench-top and pilot plant capabilities; and research support to operations.
Raw Materials
Raw materials used in our businesses (purchased from local, regional and international suppliers) consist of ingredients and packaging materials. The principal ingredients for most of our businesses are agricultural commodities, including wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, vegetable oils, milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, cocoa, corn syrup and sugar. Additionally, the principal ingredients for the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses are eggs, pork, pasta, potatoes, cheese, milk and butter. A portion of our egg needs comes from Company-owned layer hens, and the balance is purchased under 
third party contracts and in the spot market. We also buy significant amounts of grain to feed layer hens. In addition, we procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals, local auctions, country markets and corporate and family farms in various United States locations. Each of our segments utilizes raw material sources that ensure that its products meet standards and certification requirements, where applicable, for example, non-GMO, organic, gluten-free and/or cage-free. The principal packaging materials used by our businesses are linerboard cartons, corrugated boxes, plastic containers, flexible and beverage packaging, cartonboard, and aseptic foil and plastic lined cartonboard. 
Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials can fluctuate widely due to external factors, such as weather conditions, feed costs, labor disputes, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, industry consolidation, economic climate, energy shortages, transportation delays, commodity market prices, currency fluctuations and other unforeseen circumstances, such as avian influenza and diseases affecting livestock, which could affect the domestic poultry industry and our egg supply and our sow supply, respectively. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources.
Cereal processing ovens and most of the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail production facilities are generally fueled by natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Electricity and steam (generated in on-site, gas-fired boilers) also are used in our processing facilities. Short-term standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in the event of an interruption in natural gas supplies. Oil also may be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in the event of natural gas shortages or when its use presents economic advantages. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products, including in our internal fleet. Weetabix owns and operates its own combined heat and power generation unit, which is capable of supplying the majority of the requirements of its main operation site with power and steam which means the site can be operated using either electricity or natural gas.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
We own or have long-term licenses to use a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our businesses. Our Post Consumer Brands business’s key trademarks include Post®, Honey Bunches of Oats®, Great Grains®, Post® Shredded Wheat, Spoon Size® Shredded Wheat, Golden Crisp®, Alpha-Bits®, Oh's®, ShreddiesTM, Post® Raisin Bran, Grape-Nuts®, Honeycomb®, Frosted Mini Spooners®, Golden Puffs®, Cinnamon Toasters®, Fruity Dyno-Bites®, Cocoa Dyno-Bites®, Berry Colossal Crunch®, Malt-O-Meal®, Farina®, Dyno-Bites®, MOM’s Best®, Better Oats™, CoCo Wheats™, Weetabix®, Barbara’s® and Puffins®, each of which we own, as well as several trademarks that we license from third parties for use in the United States, Canada and several other international markets, such as Pebbles™, Oreo O’s®, Nilla®, Nutter Butter®, Chips Ahoy!®, Honeymaid®, Hostess™ Donettes™ and Hostess™ Honey Bun. Our Weetabix segment’s key trademarks include Weetabix®, Alpen®, Weetos™, Ready Brek™, Weetabix On The Go™ and Oatibix™, each of which we own. The key trademarks for the Foodservice business include Papetti’s®, Abbotsford Farms® and Simply Potatoes®, each of which we own. The key trademarks for the Refrigerated Retail business include Davidson’s Safest Choice®, Abbotsford Farms®, Better’n Eggs®, Crystal Farms®, Simply Potatoes®, Diner’s Choice®, Westfield Farms®, David’s Deli®, Owens® and Country Creek Farm®, each of which we own, and Bob Evans® (which is used in brands such as Bob Evans® Egg Whites (which is the successor to All Whites®)), Bob Evans Farms® and Pineland Farms®, which we license for worldwide use. Our BellRing Brands segment’s key trademarks include Premier Protein®, Dymatize®, ISO.100®, PowerBar®, Joint Juice® and Supreme Protein®, each of which we own. Our owned trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the United States or the U.K., as well as in many other countries where the related products are sold. 
We also own several patents in North America and elsewhere. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
We rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and provisions in other agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our products, packaging, processes and intellectual property.
Seasonality
Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by customer and consumer spending patterns and the timing of promotional activities, as well as holidays, changes in seasons or other events. For example, demand for our egg products, potatoes, sausage, side dishes and cheese tends to increase during the Thanksgiving, Christmas and other holiday seasons, which may result in increased net sales during the first quarter of our fiscal year. Demand for our Malt-O-Meal hot wheat, Better Oats oatmeal and Ready Brek hot oats cereals also tends to be seasonably skewed towards the colder winter season. Demand for various products in our BellRing Brands business tends to be lower during our first fiscal quarter as a result of the holiday season and colder weather, which impacts outdoor activities. However, on a consolidated basis our revenues and results of operations are distributed relatively evenly over the quarters of our fiscal year.
Working Capital
A description of our working capital practices is included in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report. Cash receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for our operating expenses and working capital needs. Our working capital practices also are described in Note 2 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in Item 8 of this report.
Customers
We sell Post Consumer Brands products primarily to grocery stores, mass merchandise customers, supercenters, club stores, natural/specialty stores and drug store customers. We also sell in the military, eCommerce and foodservice channels. Our Weetabix segment’s products are primarily sold to grocery stores, discounters, wholesalers and convenience stores. Our Foodservice segment’s primary customers include foodservice distributors and national restaurant chains. Our Refrigerated Retail segment’s primary customers include grocery stores, mass merchandise customers and major food manufacturers and processors. Our BellRing Brands segment’s customers are predominately club stores, food, drug and mass customers and online retailers, and also include specialty retailers, supplement and convenience stores and distributors.
Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, but certain of our segments depend on sales to large customers. For example, the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, Walmart, accounted for approximately 32% of Post Consumer Brands’s net sales in fiscal 2019. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco, Walmart and Sainsbury’s, accounted for approximately 41% of Weetabix’s net sales in fiscal 2019. The largest customers of our Foodservice segment, Sysco and US Foods accounted for approximately 41% of the segment’s net sales in fiscal 2019. Additionally, the largest customer of our Refrigerated Retail segment, Walmart, accounted for approximately 22% of the segment’s net sales in fiscal 2019, and the largest customers of our BellRing Brands segment, Costco and Walmart, accounted for approximately 70% of the segment’s net sales in fiscal 2019. For purposes of this disclosure, “Walmart” refers to Walmart and its affiliates, which include Sam’s Club and Asda.
Competition
The consumer food and beverage and convenient nutrition categories in which we operate are highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. Many of our principal competitors in these categories may have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources. Competition is based on, among other things, brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, ingredients, product quality, price, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. In addition, in many of our product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. The industries in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities and agencies. Our activities in Canada and Europe are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to our business in the United States. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, our operations must comply with stringent production, storage, distribution, labeling and marketing standards administered by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., the E.U. and elsewhere and at the state level in the United States. Products that do not meet regulatory standards may be considered to be adulterated and/or misbranded and subject to recall. Additionally, following the adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act in the United States and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act in Canada, the FDA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are implementing additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved tracing of food. 
Certain egg and meat products produced by our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments are under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) and its regulations regarding quality, labeling and sanitary control, rather than FDA regulations. The Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail egg processing plants that break eggs, and some of our other meat and egg-processing operations, are subject to continuous on-site USDA inspections. Our other United States facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the USDA, the FDA and/or state regulatory authorities, such as state departments of agriculture. The pork product manufacturing operations of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments are subject to the Packers & Stockyards Act, which also is administered by the USDA and which regulates trade practices.
Our facilities, like those of similar businesses, are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar regulations in Canada, the U.K. and Germany. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. Additionally, some of the food commodities on which our businesses rely are subject to governmental agricultural programs (e.g., subsidies and import/export regulations), which have substantial effects on prices and supplies of these commodities.
In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, including the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation and Privacy Shield, which applies to certain of our businesses and deals with the collection and use of personal information obtained from data subjects of the E.U. Our operations also are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, wastewater pretreatment and discharge, storm water, waste handling and disposal and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (Proposition 65). Our foreign facilities are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to us in the United States. Additionally, Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail layer farms dispose of animal waste primarily by transferring it to farmers for use as fertilizer, and Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail potato product facilities dispose of solid vegetable waste primarily by transferring it to processors who convert it to animal feed. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to ensure environmental compliance. 
Employees
The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have approximately 10,100 employees as of November 1, 2019, of which approximately 8,100 are in the United States, approximately 1,100 are in the U.K., approximately 500 are in Canada and approximately 400 are located in other jurisdictions. Currently, approximately 17% of such employees are unionized. We have entered into several collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industries in which we operate. Most of the unionized workers at our facilities are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years. As these agreements expire, we believe that the agreements can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. We believe that overall we have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations.
