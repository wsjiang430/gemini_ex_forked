Item 1. Business
We are a global leader of specialty cellulose materials with a broad offering of high purity cellulose specialties, a natural polymer used in the production of a variety of specialty chemical products, including liquid crystal displays, filters, textiles and performance additives for pharmaceutical, food and other industrial applications. Building upon more than 95 years of experience in cellulose chemistry, we provide some of the highest quality high-purity cellulose pulp products that make up the essential building blocks for our customers’ products while providing exceptional service and value. We also produce a unique, lightweight multi-ply paperboard product and a bulky, high-yield pulp product. Our paperboard is used for production in the commercial printing, lottery ticket and high-end packaging sectors. Our high-yield pulp is used by paperboard producers, as well as in traditional printing, writing and specialty paper manufacturing.
We focus our strategic investments in projects that optimize and align our assets to meet the ever-growing demand for renewable products. These projects include renewable energy projects at our Temiscaming facility in Quebec, Canada and our Tartas, France facility; Anomera, a manufacturer of CNC, a patented, biodegradable product used as an ingredient in cosmetics and various industrial materials; and our most recent investment at our Tartas facility to produce 2G bioethanol, intended to help meet the demand for Europe’s fast-growing biofuels market and further improve the sustainability of our operating model. With production anticipated to begin in 2024, we expect to be among the first in France to produce wood-based 2G bioethanol fuel, a product that should help petrochemical companies improve the climate profile of their energy offerings in the European market. We are also developing a prebiotic for enhanced gut health in poultry and swine, which is expected to support sustainable poultry and swine farming and provide a healthy alternative nutrient to enhance gut health. Our strategic investment approach unlocks the capabilities of our facilities and capitalizes on the sustainably harvested trees that we use as our primary feedstock.
Our Sustainability Profile
We have four production facilities, located in the U.S., Canada and France. Our facilities are energy intensive; however, over 75 percent of the energy consumed by them is derived from renewable sources, primarily biomass. We do not harvest living trees directly for energy production, but rather use production process biomass residuals or waste to generate energy in our facilities. The remaining energy consumed is primarily sourced from natural gas. 
We previously announced a goal of at least 40% reduction in overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 (aggregated) GHG emissions, on both an absolute and intensity basis, by 2030, using 2020 as a baseline. We are on track to achieve this objective and routinely monitor other opportunities. External verification of our 2021 results confirmed an 8% reduction in absolute and a 5% reduction in intensity emissions. Our 2022 results have not yet been confirmed. 
Water is utilized during various stages of our production cycle, including wood chip digestion, pulp washing and screening and fiber handling and transportation. Water is also necessary for steam and on-site power generation, air emissions control, process cooling and equipment cleaning. Each gallon of water gets used and reused multiple times in our process and 98 out every 100 gallons we use are treated and returned to natural water sources in keeping with stringent government-issued permit limitations. The remaining 2 gallons are either captured in the final product or evaporated during manufacturing.
 Our facilities are designed to minimize waste. We recycle our pulping chemicals, produce environmentally friendly co-products from the material extracted from the trees and generate energy from biomass residuals. We take special care to limit our generation of hazardous or dangerous wastes through source reduction, reuse and recycling. We seek to comply with all waste management expectations in each country where we operate. Each facility has ongoing relationships with local recyclers and we strive to reuse or recycle as much as possible. Certified waste handlers dispose of any hazardous waste.
Business Operations
Prior to June 27, 2014, we consisted of Rayonier Inc.’s wholly-owned performance fibers business, which was engaged primarily in the production of cellulose specialties. On that date, we separated from Rayonier Inc. and started our business as an independent, publicly-traded company. In November 2017, we completed the acquisition of Tembec Inc., a manufacturer of cellulose specialties, lumber, paperboard, newsprint and high-yield pulp.
In August 2021, we sold the lumber and newsprint assets acquired in the Tembec Acquisition. As a result of this sale, the operating results of the lumber and newsprint operations are presented as discontinued operations in our Financial Statements. See Note 3 — Discontinued Operations to our Financial Statements for further information.
We currently operate the following business segments, to which all prior period disclosures have been conformed:
•High Purity Cellulose
•Paperboard
•High-Yield Pulp
See Note 20 — Segment and Geographical Information to our Financial Statements for further information.
High Purity Cellulose
The High Purity Cellulose segment, and in particular, cellulose specialties products, is the primary driver of our profitability. Cellulose specialties are natural polymers, used as raw materials to manufacture a broad range of consumer-oriented products such as liquid crystal displays, impact-resistant plastics, thickeners for food products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, cigarette filters, high-tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses, food casings, paints and lacquers. We manufacture products tailored to the precise and demanding chemical and physical specifications of our customers, achieving industry-leading purity and product functionality. Our ability to consistently manufacture high-quality cellulose specialties products is the result of our proprietary production processes, intellectual property and over 95 years of technical expertise and knowledge of cellulosic chemistry. We believe end-use market diversity reduces our exposure to a potential global recession.
In addition to cellulose specialties, a significant portion of our production capacity is dedicated to manufacturing high-purity commodity products for absorbent materials and viscose applications. Absorbent materials, typically referred to as fluff fibers, are used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers, feminine hygiene products, incontinence pads, convalescent bed pads, industrial towels and wipes and non-woven fabrics. Commodity viscose pulp is a raw material required for the manufacture of viscose staple fibers which are used in woven applications, such as rayon textiles for clothing and other fabrics, and in non-woven applications, such as baby wipes, cosmetic and personal wipes, industrial wipes and mattress ticking. Cellulose specialties typically contain over 95 percent cellulose, while commodity products typically contain less than 95 percent cellulose.
Our specialized assets, capable of creating the world’s leading high purity cellulose products, are also suited for generating biofuels, bioelectricity and other biomaterials such as lignin and tall oils. Our 2G bioethanol project, for example, will capture residual sugars from our existing pulp process, which we will then use in the production of wood-based 2G bioethanol fuel. Commercial sales of this 2G bioethanol are targeted to begin in 2024 under a long-term offtake agreement with a large international petrochemicals company.
Our four production facilities have a combined annual production capacity of 1,045,000 MTs of cellulose specialties and commodity products. Of our total annual capacity, we dedicate 270,000 MTs of annual production to commodity products, primarily absorbent materials.
Wood fiber, chemicals and energy represent approximately 50 percent of our per MT cost of sales. Labor, manufacturing and maintenance supplies, depreciation, manufacturing overhead and transportation costs comprise the rest of our cost of sales.
Products
Cellulose Specialties
Cellulose specialties are a natural polymer primarily derived from either wood or cotton and are used as a principal raw material to manufacture a broad range of products. Cellulose specialties generally command a price premium and earn higher margins relative to other commodity wood pulp products. Cellulose specialties are a dissolving wood pulp product which target a combination of high purity and high viscosity. Unlike other wood pulps used for their physical properties, cellulose specialties are sought after for the unique chemical properties and reactivity they impart to downstream products. 
Derived from wood, our cellulose specialties require high levels of purity, consistency and process knowledge. Our products play a significant role in our customers’ manufacturing processes, which require cellulose specialties of high purity and uniformity for efficient production. As such, our customers demand products of the highest quality. To meet this demand, our products are custom-engineered and manufactured to each customer’s unique specifications and undergo a stringent qualification process, resulting in the quality and consistency that allow our customers to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively.
One of our key competitive advantages is our unique ability to leverage our global manufacturing asset base to provide our customers greater supply chain security for cellulose specialties fibers. With four facilities and five manufacturing lines capable of producing cellulose specialties, we are the only cellulose specialties producer in the world with the flexibility to use both hardwood and softwood fibers, kraft and sulfite cooking processes and a variety of proprietary chemical treatments to provide customized product functionality. Additionally, we possess significant knowledge of wood fiber properties and their modification under a sequence of chemical processes, which we have accumulated and developed over 95 years of practical application to satisfy a variety of customer needs. This process knowledge, combined with our manufacturing scale and flexibility and knowledge of customer applications and specifications, makes us the industry’s most adaptable modifier of cellulose fibers.
Commodity Products
We have the ability to shift our High Purity Cellulose segment manufacturing assets from cellulose specialties production to commodity absorbent materials and viscose pulp production. Our operating lines fluctuate production of cellulose specialties and commodity products based on market conditions and to generate the most attractive margins.
Absorbent materials, or fluff fibers, are typically used in consumer products such as baby diapers. These fibers provide a medium for fluid acquisition, distribution and retention in the products in which they are incorporated.
Commodity viscose pulp is primarily sold to producers of viscose staple fibers, which in turn are used to manufacture rayon fibers, which are widely used in the clothing and textile industries. Shifts in fashion styles and textile fiber blending have increased demand for viscose staple fibers. Additionally, variability in cotton linter supply and increasing environmental concerns about cotton production have resulted in viscose staple producers shifting volume away from cotton linter pulp to wood-based dissolving pulp, absent other pricing factors.
Biomaterials
We are uniquely positioned to meet the rapidly growing demand for renewable materials and sustainable products. Fully unlocking the capabilities of our biorefineries and the sustainably harvested trees we use as our primary feedstock is a core priority. Generally, a tree’s mass is comprised of 50 percent water and 50 percent “dry solids.” Dry solids are comprised of roughly 40 percent cellulose and 60 percent other chemical compounds, including hemicellulose, lignin, sugars and other extractives. These chemical compounds can be utilized to produce sustainable biomaterials. For example, we currently generate and sell lignosulfonates and tall oil soap using these compounds. Lignosulfonates are used to produce a variety of products, including construction materials, dispersants, plant nutrients, leather tanning and fungicides, and tall oil soap is used as feedstock for producing crude tall oil. We also produce bio-generated electricity utilizing renewable biomass.
Finally, we are also making good progress on our Tartas bioethanol facility. When complete, this facility will produce second-generation bioethanol, a non-food-based ethanol to be utilized as an environmentally friendly fuel blend supporting transport decarbonization.
Competition
Cellulose Specialties
Significant intellectual property, capital investment and technical expertise are needed to design and manufacture customized cellulose specialties fibers to exacting customer specifications. The product must be formulated to achieve the desired characteristics, including parameters for purity, viscosity, brightness, reactivity and other physical properties. Product qualification time can be lengthy, extending six to 24 months. Customer relationships are typically long-term and are based on an understanding of the customer’s production processes and on our technical expertise, which we utilize to help solve our customers’ production challenges and support new product development. Establishing a production line and obtaining the necessary production technologies requires substantial capital and ongoing maintenance expenditures.
Product performance and customization, technical service and price are principal methods of competition in cellulose specialties. Product performance is primarily determined by the chemical attributes of the pulp, including purity, viscosity and uniformity of the cellulose specialties. Our processes, which are a key element of our intellectual property, are capable of generating cellulose specialties purity levels in excess of 98 percent, as well as the highest levels of viscosity derived from wood pulp. Typically, product pricing is set annually in the fourth quarter for the following year based on discussions with customers and the terms of contractual arrangements.
We compete with both domestic and foreign producers in cellulose specialties. Our major competitors include GP Cellulose, Borregaard, Bracell, Sappi, Nippon, Cosmo Specialty Fibers, AustroCel and Aditya Birla Group. Some of our competitors use both wood and cotton linter fibers as a source of cellulose fibers. Our multiple manufacturing lines, processes and intellectual property allow us to compete in more segments of the cellulose specialties market than any of our competitors.
Commodity Products
The principal method of competition in commodity products is price, as purity and uniformity are less critical differentiators. Pricing for commodity products is typically referenced to published indices or based on publicly available spot market prices. We compete with both domestic and foreign producers of commodity products.
For commodity viscose pulp, many competitors derive their commodity viscose pulp from either wood or cotton. However, in recent years, commodity viscose pulp from wood has supplanted cotton as the preferred raw material input for viscose staple fiber production. Although cellulose specialties can generally be sold to meet commodity viscose demand, the reverse is not typically true. Our major competitors for commodity viscose pulp include Sappi, AustroCel and Bracell.
For absorbent materials, our major competitors include GP Cellulose, Domtar, International Paper, Klabin and Suzano.
Biomaterials 
Competition in this space is limited, driven by capital investment, technical expertise and sustainable feedstock that are needed to produce these materials. The primary global market driver for bioethanol is the regulatory agenda towards production of bioethanol with an active participation of GHG emission reduction and the positive impact on climate change. Key growth drivers for lignosulfonates include increasing usage of lignosulfonates in all the market segments where fossil petrochemicals can be replaced by sustainable bioproducts.
Pricing for biomaterials that we currently produce is based on the market dynamics of supply and demand. We supply Renewable Energy Directive II bioethanol, which is produced with nonhuman food chain inputs and trades at a premium in Europe.
Significant biomaterials competitors in the lignosulfonates market include Borregaard and Domsjö Aditya Birla.
Paperboard
We manufacture paperboard in the Temiscaming plant in Quebec, Canada. Our production facility has an annual production capacity of 180,000 MTs of paperboard.
Wood pulp, chemicals and energy represent approximately 80 percent of our per MT cost of sales. Labor, manufacturing and maintenance supplies, depreciation, manufacturing overhead and transportation costs represent our remaining cost of sales.
Products
Products in the Paperboard business include packaging, printing documents, brochures, promotional materials, paperback book and catalog covers, file folders, tags and lottery tickets. We are the only multi-ply paperboard producer in North America, with our competition producing single ply solid bleached sulfite paperboard.
Competition
The principal method of competition in our Paperboard segment is price and product performance. Pricing for paperboard is typically referenced to published indices and marketed through our internal sales team and is impacted by the balance between supply and demand, as affected by global economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Product performance is determined based on the physical attributes of the products in a customer’s manufacturing processes. To a lesser extent, quality and service are also competitive determinants.
Significant paperboard competitors include WestRock, Graphic Packaging, Metsa Group, Clearwater Paper and Sappi.
High-Yield Pulp
We manufacture and market high-yield pulp produced in our Temiscaming plant in Quebec, Canada. Our Temiscaming plant has an annual production capacity of 290,000 MTs of high-yield pulp, approximately 65,000 MTs of which are used internally to produce paperboard.
Wood fiber, chemicals and energy represent approximately 40 percent of our per MT cost of sales. Labor, manufacturing and maintenance supplies, depreciation, manufacturing overhead and transportation costs represent our remaining cost of sales.
Products
We produce our high-yield pulp primarily from hardwood aspen, maple and birch species. This unique fiber supply produces a highly sought-after bulky high-yield pulp product. High-yield pulp is used by paper manufacturers to produce paperboard, packaging, printing and writing papers and a variety of other paper products.
Competition
The principal method of competition in the High-Yield Pulp segment is price, however a better quality (i.e., higher bulk) can sometimes command a premium price. Pricing for high-yield pulp is typically referenced to published indices marketed through our internal sales team and is impacted by the balance between supply and demand, as affected by global economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
Significant high-yield pulp competitors include Millar Western, West Fraser, Paper Excellence, Estonia Cell, Sappi and Winstone Pulp. 
Raw Materials and Input Costs
All of our manufacturing operations require significant amounts of wood fiber, in the form of logs or wood chips, as a raw material and energy to produce our products. Additionally, our High Purity Cellulose and High-Yield Pulp segments’ manufacturing processes require significant amounts of chemicals. These raw materials and input costs are subject to significant changes in prices as a result of weather conditions, supply and demand. To control cost, we continually pursue reductions in usage and costs of key supplies, services and raw materials. 
Wood
We procure wood chips for our high purity cellulose and high-yield pulp plants through the purchase of chips from lumber producers or the production for chips from roundwood at our own wood chipping facilities. Prices for wood are impacted by various factors, including supply and demand, weather events, transportation costs for delivery and overall economic conditions.
Chemicals
Chemicals, which include caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), sulfuric acid, ammonia, sodium chlorate and various specialty chemicals, are purchased under negotiated supply agreements with third parties. The prices for these chemicals are impacted by various factors including supply and demand, environmental regulation, energy prices and overall economic conditions.
Energy
Our energy is primarily produced through the burning of lignin and other residual biomass in recovery and power boilers located at our plants. In addition, our manufacturing facilities utilize significant amounts of fuel oil, natural gas and purchased electricity to supplement their energy requirements. Our energy costs are also impacted by emission allowances purchased or sold at market prices during any given period. In addition, energy prices impact our transportation costs for delivery of raw materials to our manufacturing facilities and delivery of our finished products to customers.
Intellectual Property
Substantially all of our intellectual property relates to our High Purity Cellulose segment. We own patents, trademarks and trade secrets, and have developed significant expertise, particularly in the production of high purity cellulose, but also in the production of paperboard, which we deem vital to our operations. We intend to protect our intellectual property, including, when appropriate, through the filing of patent applications for inventions that we deem important to our business and operations. Our U.S. patents generally have a duration of 20 years from the date of filing. We also require key employees to enter into non-compete agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements as appropriate.
Seasonality
Our operating results may be materially affected by seasonal changes and the related impact on energy prices. 
Customers
No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. One customer in the High Purity Cellulose segment represented 10 percent of total sales for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Research and Development
Our R&D capabilities and activities are primarily focused on our High Purity Cellulose segment. The quality and consistency of our cellulose specialties, together with our R&D capabilities, are important factors in achieving an optimal value for our cellulose specialties products and create a material competitive advantage. Our R&D efforts are directed at further developing products and technologies, improving the quality of cellulose fiber grades, improving manufacturing efficiency and environmental controls and reducing fossil fuel consumption. We continue to focus our R&D activities to develop and market additional new products and applications. We spent $7 million on R&D during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Environmental Matters
Our manufacturing operations are subject to stringent federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharges, waste handling and disposal, and assessment and remediation of environmental contamination, which impact our current ongoing operations and approximately 20 former operating facilities or third party-owned sites classified as disposed operations. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the RCRA, the CERCLA and similar state laws and regulations impacting U.S. facilities, as well as requirements relating to ancillary matters such as financial assurance of our legal obligations for facility closure and post-closure care. Similar laws and legal requirements also impact current and former operating sites in Canada and France, respectively. In addition to ongoing compliance with laws and regulations, our facilities operate in accordance with various permits, which are issued by state and federal environmental agencies. Many of these permits impose operating conditions which require significant expenditures to ensure compliance. Upon renewal and renegotiation of these permits, the issuing agencies often seek to impose new or additional conditions in response to new environmental laws and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, under many federal environmental laws, private citizens and organizations, such as environmental advocacy groups, have the right to legally challenge permitting and other decisions made by regulatory agencies. 
Our operations are subject to constantly changing environmental requirements, and interpretations of existing requirements, which are often impacted by new policy initiatives, new and amended legislation and regulation, negotiations involving state and federal governmental agencies and various other stakeholders, as well as, at times, litigation. Our future spending requirements in the area of environmental compliance could change significantly based on the passage of new environmental laws and regulations. Management closely monitors our environmental responsibilities and believes we are in material compliance with current requirements. 
See Item 1A — Risk Factors for a discussion of the potential impact of environmental risks on our business, as well as Note 10 — Environmental Liabilities and Note 21 — Commitments and Contingencies to our Financial Statements for further discussion of our estimated environmental liabilities and any environmental-related litigation.
