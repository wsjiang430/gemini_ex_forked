During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), the Steel Processing, Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs operating segments served approximately 800, 4,500, and 65 customers, respectively, located primarily in the United States.  International operations accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2019 and were comprised primarily of sales to customers in Europe.  No single customer accounted for over 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019. 
 Refer to “Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note O – Segment Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of our reportable business segments.
 Recent Developments
 In November, 2017, our joint venture Worthington Armstrong Venture (“WAVE”) agreed to sell its business and operations in Europe and Asia, to Knauf Group, a family-owned manufacturer of building materials headquartered in Germany.  The sale is part of a broader transaction involving the other party in the joint venture and does not include the WAVE businesses and operations in the Americas.  The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is anticipated to close before the end of calendar 2019.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the parties agreed to extend the date by which certain competition clearance conditions were to be satisfied per the original purchase agreement.  In exchange, Knauf Group irrevocably agreed to fund the purchase price which was received by AWI in two distributions, the first on August 1, 2018, and the balance on September 15, 2018.   For further information refer to “Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – NOTE C – Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates”.

On July 31, 2018, the Company sold its Garden City, Kansas and Dickinson, North Dakota oil & gas equipment manufacturing facilities to Palmer Mfg. & Tank Inc. for $20.3 million, net of selling costs, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.0 million recorded in restructuring and other expense (income), net.

The purchase price was $13.5 million including contingent consideration related to an earn-out provision tied to future performance.
Steel Processing
 Our Steel Processing reportable segment consists of the Worthington Steel business unit, and our consolidated joint ventures, Spartan, TWB and WSP.  It also included Worthington Steelpac Systems, LLC (“Packaging Solutions”), which designs and manufactures recyclable steel packaging solutions for the movement of products, through May 31, 2017.  For fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by the Steel Processing operating segment was approximately 65%, 63% and 69%, respectively.
 
Worthington Steel is one of the largest independent intermediate processors of flat-rolled steel in the United States.  It occupies a niche in the steel industry by focusing on products requiring exact specifications.  These products cannot typically be supplied as efficiently by steel mills to the end-users of these products.
 
As of May 31, 2019, the Steel Processing reportable segment, including Spartan, TWB, and WSP, operated 21 manufacturing facilities located in Ohio (5), Michigan (5), Mexico (4), Tennessee (2), Alabama (1), Indiana (1), Kentucky (1), New York (1), and Canada (1).  
 
Our Steel Processing reportable segment serves approximately 800 customers, principally in the automotive, aerospace, agricultural, appliance, construction, container, hardware, heavy-truck, HVAC, lawn and garden, leisure and recreation, office furniture and office equipment markets.  The automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel, and thus the largest end market for our Steel Processing operating segment.  For fiscal 2019, Steel Processing’s top three customers represented approximately 31% of the operating segment’s total net sales.
 
Our Steel Processing reportable segment buys coils of steel from integrated steel mills and mini-mills and processes them to the precise type, thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality required by customer specifications.  Computer-aided processing capabilities include, among others:
 
 
• | cold reducing, which achieves close tolerances of thickness;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | configured blanking, which mechanically stamps steel into specific shapes;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | coil fed laser blanking, which uses lasers to cut coils of steel, aluminum and other metals into specific shapes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cutting-to-length, which cuts coils into sheets of exact length;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | dry-lube, the process of coating steel with a dry, soap-based lubricant;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hot-dipped galvanizing, which coats steel with zinc and zinc alloys through a hot-dip process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | hydrogen annealing, a thermal process that changes the hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | laser welding, which joins steel or aluminum blanks and coils with different thicknesses, coatings or material strength;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3


 
• | pickling, a chemical process using an acidic solution to remove surface oxide which develops on hot-rolled steel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | slitting, which cuts steel coils or steel sheets to specific widths;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | oscillate slitting, a slitting process that spools together several narrow coils welded end-to-end into one larger coil;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | temper rolling, which is the process of light cold-rolling steel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tension leveling, a method of applying pressure to achieve precise flatness tolerances; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | non-metallic coating, including acrylic and paint coating. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our Steel Processing reportable segment also toll processes steel for steel mills, large end-users, service centers and other processors.  Toll processing is different from typical steel processing in that the mill, end-user or other party retains title to the steel and has the responsibility for selling the end product.  Toll processing enhances Worthington Steel’s participation in the market for wide sheet steel and large standard orders, a market generally served by steel mills rather than by intermediate steel processors.
 
The steel processing industry is fragmented and highly competitive.  There are many competitors, including other independent intermediate processors.  Competition is primarily on the basis of price, product quality and the ability to meet delivery requirements. Technical service and support for material testing and customer-specific applications enhance the quality of products (see the Technical Services section below).  However, the extent to which technical service and support capability has improved Steel Processing’s competitive position has not been quantified.  Steel Processing’s ability to meet tight delivery schedules is, in part, based on the proximity of our facilities to customers, suppliers and one another.  The extent to which plant location has impacted Steel Processing’s competitive position has not been quantified.  Processed steel products are priced competitively, primarily based on market factors, including, among other things, market pricing, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs, and overall economic conditions in the United States and abroad.
 Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the operations of Packaging Solutions were realigned, moving from the Steel Processing reportable segment to the Engineered Cabs reportable segment. 
 Pressure Cylinders
 The Pressure Cylinders reportable segment consists of the Worthington Cylinders business unit. The percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by Pressure Cylinders was approximately 32%, 34% and 28% in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.  The results of New AMTROL Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “AMTROL”) have been consolidated within Pressure Cylinders since its acquisition on June 2, 2017.
 Our Pressure Cylinders reportable segment manufactures and sells filled and unfilled pressure cylinders, tanks, hand torches, well water and expansion tanks, and oil and gas equipment along with various accessories and related products for diversified end-use market applications.  The following is a description of these markets:  
  
• | Industrial Products: This market sector includes high pressure and acetylene cylinders for industrial gases, refrigerant and certain propane gas (LPG) cylinders, alternative fuel cylinders, cryogenic equipment and systems and services for handling liquid gases, and other specialty products.

 While a large percentage of Pressure Cylinders sales are made to major accounts, this operating segment served approximately 4,500 customers during fiscal 2019.  No single customer represented greater than 10% of net sales for the Pressure Cylinders operating segment during fiscal 2019.  
 
The Pressure Cylinders reportable segment, operates 19 manufacturing facilities located in Alabama, California, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio (5), Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Utah, Wisconsin, Austria, Poland (2), Portugal and Turkey.  
 
For sales in the United States and Canada, high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders are primarily manufactured in accordance with United States Department of Transportation and Transport Canada specifications.  Outside the United States and Canada, cylinders are manufactured according to European norm specifications, as well as various other international standards.  Other products are produced to applicable industry standards including, as applicable, those standards issued by the American Petroleum Institute, ASME and UL.
 
Worthington Cylinders has one principal domestic competitor in the low-pressure LPG cylinder market, and there are a number of foreign competitors in the LPG cylinder market and in the non-refillable refrigerant market.  We believe that Worthington Cylinders has the largest market share in its domestic low-pressure cylinder markets.  In the other cylinder markets, there are several competitors.  Worthington Cylinders is a leading supplier to the European markets for both the high-pressure cylinders and the low-pressure non-refillable cylinders.  Worthington Cylinders generally has a strong competitive position for its industrial, energy, retail and specialty products, but competition varies on a product-by-product basis, and geographically for energy products.  As with our other operating segments, competition is based upon price, service and quality.
 
The Pressure Cylinders reportable segment uses the trade names “Worthington Cylinders”, “AMTROL” and “Alfa” to conduct business.
 The Company uses the registered trademark “Balloon Time®” to market helium-filled balloon kits; the registered trademark “BERNZOMATIC®” to market certain fuel cylinders and hand held torches; the trademark “WORTHINGTON PRO-GRADE” to market certain LPG cylinders, hand torches and camping fuel cylinders; the registered trademarks “MAP-PRO®” and “Pro-Max®” to market certain hand torch cylinders; the registered trademark “Mag-Torch®” to market certain hand-held torches; the registered trademark “Superior Tool®” to market certain tools used primarily in plumbing; the registered trademarks “Therm-X-Trol®” and “Extrol®” to market thermal expansion tanks; the registered trademarks “Well X Trol®”, “Champion®”, and “Wel-Flo and Design®” to market well tanks; and the registered trademarks “Hydromax®” and “Boilermate®” to market indirect fired water heaters.
 Engineered Cabs
 The Engineered Cabs reportable segment consists of the Worthington Industries Engineered Cabs business unit and, effective June 1, 2017, our Packaging Solutions business.  For each of fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by the Engineered Cabs operating segment was approximately 3%.
 
Engineered Cabs is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio and operates four manufacturing facilities, one each in Indiana, Ohio, South Dakota and Tennessee, which are located near key assembly locations of original equipment manufacturers.

Engineered Cabs is a non-captive designer and manufacturer of high-quality, custom-engineered open and enclosed cabs and operator stations and custom fabrications and packaging for heavy mobile equipment used primarily in the agricultural, construction, forestry, military and mining industries.  Engineered Cabs’ product design, engineering support and broad manufacturing capabilities enable it to produce custom cabs and structures used in products ranging from small utility equipment to large earthmovers.  Packaging Solutions designs and manufactures reusable custom steel platforms, racks and pallets for supporting, protecting and handling products throughout the shipping process.
 
In addition to its engineered cab products, this operating segment has the capability to provide a full suite of complementary products such as machined structural components, complex and painted weldments, and engine doors.  Engineered Cabs has the manufacturing capability for metal laser cutting, metal bending and forming, roll-form tube curving and bending, machining, welding – robotic and manual, automated product cleaning and E-coating, top coat painting and assembly.
 
Engineered Cabs produces products for approximately 100 different equipment platforms for approximately 65 customers. For fiscal 2019, Engineered Cabs’ top three customers represented approximately 45% of the operating segment’s total net sales.  Its production levels can range from small and medium production volumes through high volume productions.
 
Engineered Cabs competes with a limited number of large non-captive producers of engineered cabs in the United States, and numerous other suppliers who can perform various functions supplied by the Company.  Many customers can also produce operator cabs in-house.  The Company’s competitive strengths include design and engineering capabilities as well as broad manufacturing capabilities, often providing a fully-integrated complete cab at a more effective cost than customers can produce in-house.  Competitive drivers are related to innovation, quality, delivery and service.  
 
Key supplies for this operating segment include steel sheet and plate, stampings, steel tubing, hardware, controls, wiper systems, glazing materials (glass, polycarbonate), perishables (paint, urethane, caulk), electrical materials, HVAC systems and aesthetic materials (acoustical trim, plastics, foam), which are available from a variety of sources.  
 As noted above, effective June 1, 2017, the operations of Packaging Solutions were realigned, moving from the Steel Processing reportable segment to the Engineered Cabs reportable segment.  Packaging Solutions operates one facility in Indiana.

Suppliers 
 The primary raw material purchased by Worthington is steel.  We purchase steel in large quantities at regular intervals from major primary producers of steel, both domestic and foreign. The amount purchased from any particular supplier varies from year to year depending on a number of factors including market conditions, then current relationships and prices and terms offered.  In nearly all market conditions, steel is available from a number of suppliers and generally any supplier relationship or contract can and has been replaced with little or no significant interruption to our business.  During fiscal 2019, we purchased approximately 2.6 million tons of steel (72% hot-rolled, 12% cold-rolled and 16% galvanized) on a consolidated basis.  
 In the Steel Processing operating segment, steel is primarily purchased and processed based on specific customer orders.  The Pressure Cylinders and Engineering Cabs operating segments purchase steel to meet production schedules.  For certain raw materials, there are more limited suppliers -- for example, helium and zinc, which are generally purchased at market prices.  Since there are a limited number of suppliers in the helium and zinc markets, if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted due to a force majeure type occurrence, it may be difficult to obtain an alternative supply.  Raw materials are generally purchased in the open market on a negotiated spot-market basis at prevailing market prices.  Supply contracts are also entered into, some of which have fixed pricing and some of which are indexed (monthly or quarterly).  During fiscal 2019, we purchased steel from the following major suppliers, in alphabetical order: AK Steel Holding Corporation; ArcelorMittal; NLMK USA; North Star BlueScope Steel, LLC; Nucor Corporation; Steel Dynamics, Inc.; and United States Steel Corporation (“U.S. Steel”).  Major suppliers of aluminum to the Pressure Cylinders operating segment in fiscal 2019 were, in alphabetical order:  Arconic Inc.; DK Resources Limited; Geumsan Tech; Meyer Aluminum; Novelis Corporation; Sapa Group and Shanghai Everskill.  Major suppliers of zinc to the Steel Processing operating segment in fiscal 2019 were, in alphabetical order: Considar Metal Marketing Inc. (a/k/a HudBay); Glencore Ltd; and Teck Resources Limited.  Approximately 31.5 million pounds of zinc and 6.1 million pounds of aluminum were purchased in fiscal 2019.  We believe our supplier relationships are favorable. 
Technical Services 
 We employ a staff of engineers and other technical personnel, and we maintain fully equipped laboratories to support operations.  These facilities enable verification, analysis and documentation of the physical, chemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties of raw materials and products.  Technical Service personnel also work in conjunction with the sales force to specify components and materials required to fulfill customer needs.  Engineers at Engineered Cabs design cabs and cab manufacturing processes according to applicable industry standards. To provide these services, we conduct developmental engineering with respect to product characteristics, requirements and performance.  Laboratory facilities also perform metallurgical and chemical testing as dictated by the regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and other associated agencies, along with International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ASTM International, and other customer and industry specific requirements.  An IASI (International Accreditations Service, Incorporated) accredited product material testing laboratory supports some of these efforts.
 Seasonality and Backlog
 Sales are generally strongest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as our operating segments are generally operating at seasonal peaks.  Historically, sales have generally been weaker in the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to reduced activity in the building and construction industry as a result of inclement weather, as well as customer plant shutdowns, particularly in the automotive industry, due to holidays.  We do not believe backlog is a significant indicator of our business.
Employees
 As of May 31, 2019, we had approximately 12,000 employees, including those employed by our unconsolidated joint ventures.  Approximately 8% of our consolidated labor force is represented by collective bargaining units.  Worthington believes it has good relationships with its employees, including those covered by collective bargaining units.
Joint Ventures
 As part of our strategy to selectively develop new products, markets and technological capabilities and to expand our international presence, while mitigating the risks and costs associated with those activities, as of May 31, 2019, we participated in three consolidated and six unconsolidated joint ventures.

 Environmental Regulation
 Our manufacturing facilities, generally in common with those of similar industries making similar products, are subject to many federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.  We examine ways to reduce emissions and waste and to decrease costs related to environmental compliance.  The cost of compliance or capital expenditures for environmental control facilities required to meet environmental requirements are not anticipated to be material when compared with overall costs and capital expenditures and, accordingly, are not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, or on the competitive position of Worthington or any particular business segment.
