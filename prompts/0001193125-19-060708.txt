ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Our Company 
 We are the only publicly-traded asset management company that focuses exclusively on exchange-traded products, or ETPs, and are one of the leading ETP sponsors in the world based on assets under management, or AUM, with AUM of $54.1 billion globally as of December 31, 2018. An ETP is a pooled investment vehicle that holds a basket of securities, financial instruments or other assets and generally seeks to track (index-based) or outperform (actively managed) the performance of a broad or specific equity, fixed income or alternatives market segment, commodity or currency (or an inverse or multiple thereof). ETPs are listed on an exchange with their shares traded in the secondary market at market prices, generally at approximately the same price as the net asset value of their underlying components. ETP is an umbrella term that includes exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded commodities. 
 Our family of ETFs includes funds that track our own indexes, funds that track third-party indexes and actively managed funds. Most of our equity-based funds employ a fundamentally weighted investment methodology, which weights securities based on factors such as dividends or earnings, whereas most other ETF industry indexes use a capitalization weighted methodology. Our broad regulatory exemptive relief enables us to use our own indexes for certain of our ETFs and actively manage other ETFs. We distribute our ETFs through all major channels within the asset management industry, including brokerage firms, registered investment advisers and institutional investors. 
 We focus on creating ETFs for investors that offer thoughtful innovation, smart engineering and redefined investing. We have launched many first-to-market ETFs in the United States and pioneered alternative weighting and performance methods commonly referred to as smart beta. However, our U.S. listed ETFs are not beta, but rather an investment innovation we call Modern Alpha. Our Modern Alpha approach combines the outperformance potential of active management with the benefits of passive management to offer investors cost-effective ETFs that are built to perform. 
 We strive to deliver a better investing experience through innovative solutions. Continued investments in technology-enabled services and the launch of our Advisor Solutions program in October 2017, which includes portfolio construction, asset allocation, practice management services and wealth management technology via the AdvisorEngine platform, have been made to differentiate us in the market, expand our distribution and further enhance our relationships with financial advisors. 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 19, 1985 as Financial Data Systems, Inc. 
 Our Operating and Financial Results 
 We operate as an ETP sponsor and asset manager providing investment advisory services globally. These activities are reported in our U.S. Business and International Business segments. Our international segment includes our European business and our Canadian business. 
 In April 2018, we acquired the European exchange-traded commodity, currency and short-and-leveraged business, or ETFS, of ETFS Capital Limited, or ETFS Capital. Throughout this report, we refer to the acquired business as ETFS and the acquisition as the ETFS Acquisition. ETFS had approximately $17.6 billion of AUM as of April 10, 2018. Following the ETFS Acquisition we became the largest global independent ETP provider based on AUM, with significant scale and presence in the U.S. and Europe, the two largest ETP markets. 
 U.S. Business Segment 
 Our U.S. listed ETFs AUM decreased from $46.8 billion at December 31, 2017 to $35.5 billion at December 31, 2018 due to net outflows primarily from our two largest U.S. listed ETFs, the WisdomTree Europe 
 
2 


  Hedged Equity Fund, or HEDJ, and the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund, or DXJ, and market depreciation. These decreases were partly offset by net inflows into certain of our U.S. listed ETFs (including within our fixed income, U.S. equity, emerging markets and alternative strategy ETFs). 
 



International Business Segment 
 Our international ETFs AUM increased from $2.1 billion at December 31, 2017 to $18.6 billion at December 31, 2018 primarily due to the $17.6 billion of AUM acquired in connection with the ETFS Acquisition and net inflows, partly offset by market depreciation.

 Consolidated Operating Results 
 The following table sets forth our revenues and net income for the last three years. Prior period amounts previously disclosed have been reclassified to conform with our current presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income. 

 | Revenues  We recorded operating revenues of $274.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, up 20.1% from the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the ETFS Acquisition, partly offset by lower average AUM of our U.S. Business segment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expenses  Total operating expenses increased 18.8% from the year ended December 31, 2017 to $212.8 million primarily due to expenses associated with the ETFS acquired business, higher acquisition-related costs and higher third-party distribution fees. These expenses were partly offset by lower compensation expense in our U.S. Business segment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Other Income/(Expenses)  Other income/(expense) includes interest income and interest expense, gains/(losses) on revaluation of deferred consideration, impairment charges and other gains and losses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Net income  Net income increased 34.7% from the year ended December 31, 2017 to $36.6 million.

Seasonality 
 We believe seasonal fluctuations in the asset management industry are common, however such trends are generally masked by global market events and market volatility in general. Therefore, period to period comparisons of ours or the industrys flows and operating results may not be meaningful or indicative of results in future periods. 
Assets Under Management 
 WisdomTree ETPs 
 A significant portion of our AUM historically has been held in ETFs that invest in foreign securities. Therefore, our AUM and revenues are affected by movements in global capital markets and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Over the last three years, concentrations in our two largest ETFs, HEDJ, our European equity ETF which hedges exposure to the euro, and DXJ, our Japanese equity ETF which hedges exposure to the yen have declined dramatically. Negative investor sentiment toward these products has led to net outflows of $23.8 billion during this timeframe and our concentrations in these two products were reduced from 42% on January 1, 2016 to 14% at December 31, 2018. While reduced, our exposure to these two 
 
4 


  ETFs remains significant and therefore the strengthening of the euro or yen against the U.S. dollar, the decline in European or Japanese equity markets, or political or other market risks in either of these markets, may have an adverse effect on our results. 
 The chart below sets forth the asset mix of our ETPs for the last three years: 
 


The ETFS Acquisition diversified our investment theme concentrations by adding commodity exposures, predominantly gold, that historically have been negatively correlated with our two largest U.S. listed ETFs, HEDJ and DXJ. While, we therefore may experience improved stability of AUM and lower overall AUM volatility, we can provide no assurance that this will be the case. 
 Our Industry 
 An ETF is an investment fund that holds securities such as equities or bonds and/or other assets such as derivatives or commodities, and generally trades at approximately the same price as the net asset value of its underlying components over the course of the trading day. ETFs offer exposure to a wide variety of asset classes and investment themes, including domestic, international and global equities, and fixed income securities, as well as securities in specific industries and countries. There are also ETFs that track certain specific investments, such as commodities, real estate or currencies. 
 We believe ETPs, the vast majority of which are comprised of ETFs, have been one of the most innovative investment products to emerge in the last two decades in the asset management industry. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 8,200 ETPs in globally with aggregate AUM of $4.8 trillion.

 ETFs have become more popular among a broad range of investors as they come to understand the benefits of ETFs and use them for a variety of purposes and strategies, including low cost index investing and asset allocation, access to specific asset classes, protective hedging, income generation, arbitrage opportunities and diversification. 
 While ETFs are similar to mutual funds in many respects, they have some important differences as well: 
 

 | Transparency. ETFs disclose the composition of their underlying portfolios on a daily basis, unlike mutual funds, which typically disclose their holdings every 90 days.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 


 
 | Intraday trading, hedging strategies and complex orders. Like stocks, ETFs can be bought and sold on exchanges throughout the trading day at market prices. ETFs update the indicative values of their underlying portfolios every 15 seconds. As publicly-traded securities, ETF shares can be purchased on margin and sold short, enabling the use of hedging strategies, and traded using limit orders, allowing investors to specify the price points at which they are willing to trade.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Tax efficiency. In the U.S., whenever a mutual fund or ETF realizes a capital gain that is not balanced by a realized loss, it must distribute the capital gain to its shareholders. These gains are taxable to all shareholders, even those who reinvest the gain distributions in additional shares of the fund. However, most ETFs typically redeem their shares through in-kind redemptions in which low-cost securities are transferred out of the ETF in exchange for fund shares in a non-taxable transaction. By using this process, ETFs can avoid the transaction fees and tax impact incurred by mutual funds that sell securities to generate cash to pay out redemptions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Uniform pricing. From a cost perspective, ETFs are one of the most equitable investment products on the market. Investors in U.S. listed ETFs, regardless of their size, structure or sophistication, pay identical advisory fees. Unlike mutual funds, U.S. listed ETFs generally do not have different share classes or different expense structures for retail and institutional clients and ETFs typically are not sold with sales loads or 12b-1 fees. In many cases, ETFs offer lower expense ratios than comparable mutual funds.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ETFs are used in various ways by a range of investors, from conservative to speculative uses including: 
 

 | Low cost index investing. ETFs provide exposure to a variety of broad-based indexes across equities, fixed income, commodities and other asset classes and strategies, and can be used as both long-term portfolio holdings or short-term trading tools. ETFs offer an efficient and less costly method by which to gain exposure to indexes as compared to individual stock ownership.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Improved access to specific asset classes. Investors often use ETFs to gain access to specific market sectors or regions around the world by investing in an ETF that holds a portfolio of securities in that region or segment rather gaining exposure by purchasing individual securities or physical commodities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Asset allocation. Investors seeking to invest in various asset classes to develop an asset allocation model in a cost-effective manner can do so easily with ETFs, which offer broad exposure to various asset classes in a single security.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Protective hedging. Investors seeking to protect their portfolios may use ETFs as a hedge against unexpected declines in prices of securities arising from market movements and changes in currency and interest rates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Income generation. Investors seeking to obtain income from their portfolios may buy fixed income ETFs that typically distribute monthly income or dividend-paying ETFs that encompass a basket of dividend-paying stocks rather than buying individual stocks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Speculative investing. Investors with a specific directional opinion about a market sector may choose to buy or sell (long or short) an ETF covering or leveraging that market sector.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Arbitrage. Sophisticated investors may use ETFs to exploit perceived value differences between the ETF and the value of the ETFs underlying portfolio of securities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Diversification. By definition, ETFs represent a basket of securities and each fund may contain hundreds or even thousands of different individual securities. The instant diversification of ETFs provides investors with broad exposure to an asset class, market sector or geography.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The asset management industry experienced a pullback in net flows from the prior year due to uncertainties arising from U.S. trade policies toward China and other trading partners, increases in interest rates and recessionary concerns. While the market backdrop had an adverse impact to the industry, the ETF sector 
 
7 


  continues to demonstrate that it is favored amongst investors. According to the Investment Company Institute, from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, equity ETFs have generated positive inflows of approximately $743 billion while long-term equity mutual funds have experienced outflows of approximately $678 billion. In addition, ETF fixed income flows are benefiting from a broader range of investors gravitating toward fixed income products in the ETF structure. We believe this trend is due to the inherent benefits of ETFstransparency, liquidity and tax efficiency. 
 We believe our growth, and the growth of the ETF industry in general, will continue to be driven by the following factors: 
 

 | Education and greater investor awareness. Over the last several years, ETFs have been taking a greater share of inflows and AUM from mutual funds. We believe investors have become more aware of some of the deficiencies of mutual funds and other financial products and are increasing their focus on important characteristics of their traditional investmentsnamely transparency, tradability, liquidity, tax efficiency and fees. Their attention and education focused on these important investment characteristics may be one of the drivers of the shift in inflows from traditional mutual funds to ETFs. We believe as investors continue to become more aware and educated about ETFs and their benefits, ETFs will continue to take market share from traditional mutual funds and other financial products or structures such as hedge funds, separate accounts and individual stocks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Move to fee-based models. In April 2016, the Department of Labor, or DOL, published its final rule to address conflicts of interest in retirement advice, commonly referred to as the Fiduciary Rule, and full compliance with the rule was required by July 1, 2019. However, in 2018, court rulings vacated the Fiduciary Rule. Even though the Fiduciary Rule was vacated, in response to preparing for compliance with the Fiduciary Rule, many financial advisors over the last several years have changed the revenue model that they charge clients from one that is transaction-based, that is, based on commissions for trades or receiving sales loads, to a fee-based approach, where an overall fee is charged based on the value of AUM. This fee-based approach lends itself to the adviser selecting no-load, lower-fee financial products, and in our opinion, better aligns advisers with the interests of their clients. Since ETFs generally charge lower fees than mutual funds, we believe this model shift, which we anticipate will remain in place even though the Fiduciary Rule was vacated, will benefit the ETF industry. As major brokerage firms and asset managers encourage their advisers to move towards fee-based models, we believe overall usage of ETFs likely will increase.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Innovative product offerings. Historically, ETFs tracked traditional equity indexes, but the volume of ETF growth has led to significant innovation and product development. As demand has increased, the number of ETFs also has increased and today, ETFs are available for virtually every asset class including fixed income, commodities, alternative strategies, leveraged/inverse, real estate and currencies. However, we believe that there remain substantial areas for ETF sponsors to continue to innovate, including alternative- and investment theme-based strategies, hard and soft commodities, and actively managed strategies. We also believe the further expansion of ETFs will fuel additional growth and investments from investors who typically access these products through hedge funds, separate accounts, stock investments or the futures and commodity markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | New distribution channels. Online retail discount brokers now offer free trading and promotion of select ETFs. We believe the promotion of ETF trading by discount brokers and their marketing of ETFs and model portfolios to a wider retail channel, will contribute to the growth of ETFs. Additionally, digital wealth management is evolving and online tools and robo-advisors are gaining wider acceptance with retail investors to assist with investment decisions. These advisors are increasingly utilizing model portfolios, which we believe will also contribute to the growth of ETFs. Institutional investors such as pensions, endowments and even mutual funds are also increasing their use of ETFs as trading tools as well as core holdings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Changing demographics. As the baby boomer generation continues to mature and retire, we expect that there will be a greater demand for a broad range of investment solutions, with an emphasis on
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

income generation and principal protection, and that more of these investors will seek advice from professional financial advisors. We believe these financial advisors will migrate more of their clients portfolios to ETFs due to their lower fees, better fit within fee-based models, and their ability to provide access to more diverse market sectors, improve multi-asset class allocation, and be used for different investment strategies, including income generation. Overall, we believe ETFs are well-suited to meet the needs of this large and important group of investors. In addition, since many younger investors and financial advisors have demonstrated a preference for the ETF structure over traditional product structures, we believe that wealth transfers from one generation to another will also have a positive effect on ETF industry growth.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | International markets. We believe the growth of ETFs is a global phenomenon. While the U.S. currently represents the vast majority of global ETF assets, Europe, Canada, Asia and Latin America are growing. Many of the same growth drivers powering the U.S. ETF industry are taking hold in global markets. Additionally, there is an increasing trend of non-U.S. institutional investors investing in U.S. listed ETFs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Changing regulatory landscape. Many regulators globally are implementing rules that favor fee-based account structures, barring of commissions or incentives to advisors that put their interests ahead of clients and promoting trading of ETFs. We believe these regulatory changes are conducive to ETF growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths 
 

 | Well-positioned in large and growing markets. We believe that ETFs are well positioned to grow significantly faster than the asset management industry as a whole, making our focus on ETFs a significant advantage versus other traditional asset management firms. In the ETF industry, being a first mover, or one of the first providers of ETFs in a particular asset class, can be a significant advantage. We believe that our early leadership in a number of asset classes positions us well to maintain a leadership position.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strong performance. We create our own indexes, most of which weight companies in our equity ETFs by a measure of fundamental value and are rebalanced annually. By contrast, traditional indexes are market capitalization weighted and tend to track the momentum of the market. In addition, we also offer actively managed ETFs, as well as ETFs based on third-party indexes. In evaluating the performance of our U.S. listed equity, fixed income and alternative ETFs against actively managed and index based mutual funds and ETFs, 81.4% of the $33.7 billion invested in our ETFs and 67.1% (49 of 73) of our ETFs covered by Morningstar as of December 31, 2018 outperformed their comparable Morningstar average since inception.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Differentiated product set, powered by innovation and performance. Our products span a variety of traditional and high growth asset classes, including equities, fixed income, currencies and alternatives, and include both passive and actively managed funds. Our innovations include launching the following industry firsts:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the first emerging markets small-cap equity ETF;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | the first actively managed currency ETF;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | the first ETF to provide investors with access to the Additional Tier 1 Contingent Convertible, or CoCo, bond market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | one of the first international local currency denominated fixed income ETFs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the first managed futures strategy ETF;
--+----------------------------------------


 | the first currency hedged international equity ETFs in the U.S.;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | the first 90/60 balanced ETF;
--+------------------------------

 
9 


 
 | the first multifactor ETFs incorporating dynamic currency hedging as a factor; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the first smart beta corporate bond suite.
--+-------------------------------------------

 Our product development strategy utilizes our Modern Alpha approach, which combines the outperformance potential of active management with the benefits of passive management to offer investors cost-effective funds that are built to perform. Components of our Modern Alpha approach include: 
 

 | Self-indexing. The majority of our ETFs are based on proprietary WisdomTree indexes which we believe gives us several advantages. First, it minimizes our third-party index licensing fees, which increases our profitability. Second, because we develop our own intellectual property, we are intimately familiar with our strategies and able to effectively communicate their value proposition in the market with research content and support. Third, it can enhance our speed to market and first mover advantage. Fourth, because these indexes are proprietary to WisdomTree, we may face similar competition, but we never face exact competition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Broad regulatory relief. Our broad exemptive relief also allows us to bring unique products to markets, including actively managed funds.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our Modern Alpha approach, our expertise in product development combined with our self-indexing capabilities and regulatory exemptive relief provides a strategic advantage, enabling us to launch innovative ETFs. 
 

 | Extensive marketing, research and sales efforts. We have invested significant resources to establish the WisdomTree brand through online and television targeted advertising, social media, as well as through our public relations efforts. Close to half of our employees are dedicated to marketing, research and sales. Our sales professionals are the primary points of contact for financial advisors, independent advisory firms and institutional investors who use our ETFs. Their efforts are enhanced through value-added services provided by our research and marketing efforts. We have strong relationships with financial advisors at leading national brokerage firms, registered investment advisers and high net worth advisers. We believe that by strategically aligning these adviser relationships and marketing campaigns with targeted research and sales initiatives and products that align with market sentiment, we differentiate ourselves from our competitors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Efficient business model with lower risk profile. We have invested heavily in the internal development of our core competencies with respect to product development, marketing, research and sales of ETFs. We outsource to third parties those services that are not our core competencies or may be resource or risk intensive, such as the portfolio management responsibilities and fund accounting operations of our ETFs. In addition, since we create our own indexes for most of our ETFs, we usually do not incur many licensing costs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strong, seasoned and creative management team. We have built a strong and dedicated senior leadership team. Most of our leadership team has significant ETF or financial services industry experience in fund operations, regulatory and compliance oversight, product development and management or marketing and communications. We believe our team, by developing an ETF sponsor from the ground up despite significant competitive, regulatory and operational barriers, has demonstrated an ability to innovate as well as recognize and respond to market opportunities and effectively execute our strategy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategies 
 Our goal is to become one of the top five ETF sponsors in the world. We believe our continued execution will enable us to increase trading volumes and build longer performance track records, which should allow us to 
 
10 


  attract additional investors and, in turn, further grow our AUM. We will seek to increase our market share and build additional scale by continuing to implement the following growth strategies: 
 

 | Foster deeper relationships through technology-driven solutions. We believe that the asset management industry is undergoing rapid change and technology is altering the way financial advisors conduct business. Our Advisor Solutions platform, which was named Fund Innovation of the Year at the 2018 Mutual Fund Industry Awards, is focused on providing technology-enabled solutions to help financial advisors address technology challenges and grow and scale their businesses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Advisor Solutions program includes: 
 

 | wealth investment research and ETF education;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | portfolio construction services such as the award-winning Digital Portfolio Developer, or DPD, an enhanced portfolio construction tool that assists financial advisors in analyzing an existing investment portfolio by analyzing the data and providing alternative portfolio approaches to consider in seeking to improve outcomes based on different measures. DPD won the Thought Leadership Initiative of the Year award at the 2018 WealthManagement.com Industry Awards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | access to ETF model portfolios, which are currently available on the platforms of TD Ameritrade, Envestnet, Key Bank, Oranj, Interactive Brokers and another large independent broker-dealer. Our model portfolios are a natural extension of our research capabilities and provide advisors access to an open-architecture approach, a tenured team and a firm dedicated to innovation and value creation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | practice management resources, including access to thought leaders in retirement planning, leadership and behavioral finance; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | wealth management technology through AdvisorEngine Inc., or AdvisorEngine, a customizable end-to-end platform for financial advisors. AdvisorEngine offers a range of distinct products that provide advisors with new client prospecting tools, online client onboarding, institutional grade analytics, trading, performance reporting and billing. It provides these features from an advisor-centric point of view, allowing advisors to deepen their engagement with clients and demonstrate the value of the advisory relationship.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase penetration within existing distribution channels and expand into new distribution channels. We believe there is an opportunity to increase our market share by further penetrating existing distribution channels, expanding into new distribution channels and cross-selling additional WisdomTree ETFs. For example, since October 2017, we have entered into the following arrangements that offer us preferred or exclusive access for our products:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | TD Ameritrade. In October 2017, 72 of our U.S. listed ETFs were added to TD Ameritrades expanded and enhanced commission-free ETF program, which allows for investors using the TD Ameritrade platform to purchase these ETFs without incurring the costs of trading commission fees. This commission-free access spans asset classes including equities, fixed income and alternatives, and includes a variety of investment categories in which we are a smart beta ETF provider.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cetera. In July 2018, our U.S. listed ETFs and our Advisor Solutions program were made available on the no-transaction fee product platform of Cetera Financial Group, the second largest independent financial advisor network in the nation. This allows for Ceteras network of independent broker-dealers to access our diverse line-up of ETF products with no transaction fees.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Ally Invest. In August 2018, our full range of U.S. listed ETFs were made available commission-free on Ally Invests online trading platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | E*Trade. In September 2018, 77 of our U.S. listed ETFs were added to E*Trades Custody Advantage program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | PIMCO. In October 2018, we entered into a collaboration with PIMCO in which PIMCOs fixed income ETFs were added to three of our ETF model portfolios available to advisors in the Model Market Center on the TD Ameritrade Institutional Platform and through AdvisorEngine.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | BNY Mellon. In January 2019, eight of our U.S. listed ETFs were added to BNY Mellons Pershing Fundvest ETF, a no transaction fee ETF platform.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Schwab ETF OneSource. In February 2019, we expanded our offerings of our U.S. listed ETFs on the Schwab ETF One Source platform, one of the largest commission-free ETF programs in the industry. Schwab clients can buy and sell 65 of our U.S. listed ETFs through the platform.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We plan to continue to enter into new distribution and other commercial arrangements to deepen and broaden our distribution capabilities. 
 

 | Leverage data intelligence to serve and expand investor base and improve sales and marketing effectiveness. Our collaboration with IBMs Advanced Analytics platform led to the development of a cognitive customer-focused lead prioritization system leveraging IBM Watson which has enhanced our distribution efforts. The system evaluates data across structured and unstructured sources such as historical investment data, market data and investor activity history, extracting behavioral insights, and is designed to enable our sales and marketing teams to optimize outreach to our current and potential investor base.

 | Capitalize on international demand for ETFs. We have taken the following steps over the past few years to broaden our reach around the world:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Europe. In April 2018, we completed the ETFS Acquisition which provided immediate scale in Europe, an industry leading position in European listed gold and commodity products, greater AUM diversification globally, and profitability within our International Business segment. We believe the acquisition also will help accelerate growth of our existing UCITS and leveraged and inverse products by leveraging the relationships and platform access that ETFS had previously.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Canada. We first established an office in Toronto in April 2016 and began distributing a select range of locally listed ETFs in July 2016. In November 2017, we acquired eight Canadian listed ETFs from Questrade, Inc., which represented approximately $77.4 million in AUM at closing. As part of the transaction, our Canadian subsidiary became a premier provider of ETFs available for purchase on a commission-free basis on Questrades self-directed platform, including all of our Canadian listed ETFs. We currently have listed 15 WisdomTree branded Canadian ETFs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had $312 million of net inflows in Canada.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Latin America. We have cross-listed many of our ETFs on the Mexican stock exchange, targeting institutional investors trading foreign securities in Mexico. We are also party to a marketing arrangement with the Compass Group to market WisdomTree ETFs in Latin America.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Israel. We have a marketing arrangement to market WisdomTree ETFs in Israel.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Asia. In January 2018, we entered into an agreement with Premia under which it provides promotional, marketing, product consulting and general education support for WisdomTree ETFs in specific Asian countries. In July 2018, we determined to restructure our distribution strategy in Japan through the closure of our Japanese sales office and expansion of our existing relationship with Premia to manage distribution of our products in Japan. We also entered into a global product partnership with ICBC Credit Suisse Asset Management (International) Company Limited in July 2016 to launch, market and distribute ETFs that track the S&P China 500 Index. A Luxembourg UCITS ETF listed in Europe in July 2016 marked the first product in this collaboration.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As ETFs are increasingly traded globally, we believe that international expansion of our marketing, communication and sales strategies will provide significant growth avenues to participate in new regional markets as well as increasing cross-border investments by non-U.S. institutional investors.

 | Launch innovative new products that diversify our product offerings and revenues. We have launched many first-to-market ETFs in the United States and pioneered alternative weighting and performance methods commonly referred to as smart beta. However, our U.S. listed ETFs are not beta, but rather an investment innovation we call Modern Alpha. Our Modern Alpha approach combines the outperformance potential of active management with the benefits of passive management to offer investors cost-effective funds that are built to perform. We believe our track record demonstrates that we can create and sell innovative ETFs that meet market demand.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Selectively pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions. We may pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions that will enable us to strengthen our current business, expand and diversify our product offerings, complement our Advisor Solutions program, increase our AUM or enter into new markets. We believe pursuing acquisitions or other strategic transactions is a cost-effective means of growing our business and AUM.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Regulatory Framework of the ETF Industry 
 Not all ETPs are ETFs. ETFs are a distinct type of security with features that are different than other ETPs. ETFs are open-end investment companies or unit investment trusts regulated in the U.S. by the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act. This regulatory structure is designed to provide investor protection within a pooled investment product. For example, the Investment Company Act requires that at least 40% of the Trustees for each ETF must not be affiliated persons of the funds investment manager, or Independent Trustees. If the ETF seeks to rely on certain rules under the Investment Company Act, a majority of the Trustees for that ETF must be Independent Trustees. In addition, as discussed below, ETFs have received exemptive orders from the staff of the SEC which exempt them from certain provisions of the Investment Company Act; however, ETFs generally operate under regulations that prohibit affiliated transactions, are subject to standard pricing and valuation rules and have mandated compliance programs. ETPs can take a number of forms in addition to ETFs, including exchange-traded notes, grantor trusts or limited partnerships. In the U.S. market, a key factor differentiating ETFs, grantor trusts and limited partnerships from exchange-traded notes is that the former hold assets underlying the ETP. Exchange traded notes, on the other hand, are debt instruments issued by the exchange-traded note sponsor. Also, each of these structures has implications for taxes, liquidity, tracking error and credit risk. 
 Because ETFs do not fit into the regulatory provisions governing mutual funds, ETF sponsors and ETFs need to obtain exemptive relief from the SEC from certain provisions of the Investment Company Act in order to operate ETFs. This exemptive relief allows the ETF sponsor to bring to market the ETFs for which the relief was requested and obtained. Applying for exemptive relief can be costly and take several months to several years depending on the type of exemptive relief sought and type of ETF. See BusinessRegulation below. 
 Our Product Categories 
 Commodity & Currency 
 The ETFS Acquisition provided us with an industry leading position in European listed gold and commodity products. The platform also offers products with exposure to other precious metals and commodities such as silver and platinum, oil and energy, agriculture and broad basket commodities. Our currency products provide investors with exposure to developed and emerging markets currencies, as well as exposures to foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Total AUM of our Commodity & Currency ETPs was $16.3 billion at December 31, 2018. 
International Developed Market Equity 
 Our International Developed Market Equity products offer a variety of strategies including currency hedged and dynamic currency hedged products, exposures to large, mid and small cap companies in these markets and 
 
13 


  multifactor strategies. Included within this family are our two largest U.S. listed ETFs, DXJ and HEDJ. Total AUM of our International Developed Market Equity ETFs was $14.6 billion at December 31, 2018. 
 U.S. Equity 
 We offer equity products that provide access to the securities of large, mid and small-cap companies located in the U.S., as well as particular market sectors and styles. Our U.S. Equity products track our own indexes, the majority of which are fundamentally weighted as opposed to market capitalization weighted indexes, which assign more weight to stocks with the highest market capitalizations. These fundamentally weighted indexes focus on securities of companies that pay regular cash dividends or on securities of companies that have generated positive cumulative earnings over a certain period. We believe weighting equity markets by dividends and income, rather than by market capitalization, can provide investors with better risk-adjusted returns over longer term periods in core equity exposures. Total AUM of our U.S. Equity products was $13.3 billion at December 31, 2018. 
 Emerging Market Equity 
 Our Emerging Market Equity products provide access to exposure of large, mid and small-cap companies located in Taiwan, China, India, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and other emerging markets regions. These products also track our own indexes, which are fundamentally weighted focusing on securities of companies that pay regular cash dividends or that have generated positive cumulative earnings over a certain period. Total AUM of our Emerging Market Equity products was $5.3 billion at December 31, 2018. 
Leveraged & Inverse 
 We offer leveraged products which seek to achieve a return that is a multiple of the performance of the underlying index and inverse products that seek to deliver the opposite of the performance in the index or benchmark they track. Strategies span across equity, commodity, government bond and currency exposures. Total AUM of our Leveraged & Inverse products was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018. 
Fixed Income 
 Our Fixed Income products seek to enhance income potential within the fixed income universe. We offer a suite of rising rate bond products based on leading fixed income benchmarks we license from third parties. We also launched the industrys first smart beta corporate bond suite. Other product offerings include those that seeks to track a yield-enhanced index of U.S. investment grade bonds and international fixed income products which are denominated in either local or U.S. currencies. Total AUM of our Fixed Income products was $2.6 billion at December 31, 2018. 
Alternatives 
 Our Alternative products include the industrys first managed futures strategy ETF and a global real return ETF. We also offer a dynamic long/short U.S. equity ETF, a dynamic bearish U.S. equity ETF and a collateralized put write strategy ETF on the S&P 500 index. We also intend to explore additional alternative strategy products in the future. Total AUM of our Alternative Strategy products was $0.8 billion at December 31, 2018. 
Sales, Marketing and Research 
 We distribute our ETFs through all major channels within the asset management industry, including brokerage firms, registered investment advisers and institutional investors. Our primary sales efforts are not directed towards the retail segment but rather are directed towards the financial or investment adviser who acts as the intermediary between the end-client and us. We do not pay commissions nor do we offer 12b-1 fees to financial advisors to use or recommend the use of our ETFs. 
 
14 


 We have developed an extensive network and relationships with financial advisors and we believe our ETFs and related research are well structured to meet their needs and those of their clients. We have taken steps to enhance and form new relationships through our Advisor Solutions program which focuses on providing technology-enabled solutions to help financial advisors grow and scale their businesses. In addition, senior advisors of ours participate as keynote speakers in various industry and WisdomTree hosted conferences and events. Our sales professionals act in a consultative role to provide financial advisors with value-added services. We seek to consistently grow our network of financial advisors and we opportunistically seek to introduce new products and services that best deliver our investment strategies to investors through these distribution channels. We have our own team of approximately 60 sales professionals globally as of December 31, 2018. We have restructured our U.S. sales force to enhance our interactions with financial advisors to further penetrate existing sales channels, and to better service new emerging distribution channels. 
 In addition, we have agreements with third parties to serve as the external marketing agents for the WisdomTree ETFs in Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and specific Asian countries, including Japan, as well as with certain brokerage firms to allow certain of our ETFs to trade commission free on their brokerage platforms in exchange for a percentage of our advisory fee revenues from certain AUM. We believe these arrangements expand our distribution capabilities in a cost-effective manner and we may continue to enter into such arrangements in the future. 
 Our marketing efforts are focused on three objectives: Increase our global brand awareness, leverage a robust-data driven digital sales experience to generate new clients and drive inflows to our ETFs and retaining existing clients, with a focus on cross-selling additional WisdomTree ETFs. We pursue these objectives through an omni-channel marketing strategy targeting at financial advisors. We utilize the following strategies: 
 

 | Targeted advertising. We create highly targeted multi-media advertising campaigns limited to established core financial media. For example, our television advertising runs exclusively on the cable networks CNBC, Fox Business and Bloomberg Television; online advertising runs on investing or ETF-specific web sites, such as www.seekingalpha.com and www.etfdatabase.com using targeted dynamic and personalized ad messaging.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Media relations. We have a full-time global corporate communications and public relations team who has established relationships with major financial media outlets. We utilize these relationships to help increase global awareness of the WisdomTree ETFs and the ETF industry in general in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Several members of our management team and multiple members of our research team are frequent market commentators and conference panelists.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Database Messaging Strategy. We have a database of financial advisors to which we regularly market through a series of messages across channels (email, display, site) that are triggered based on user interest and predictive analytics, on-demand research presentations, ETF-specific or educational events and presentations and market commentary from our senior investment strategy adviser, Professor Jeremy Siegel.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Social media. We have implemented a social media strategy that allows us to connect directly with financial advisors and investors by offering timely access to our research material and more general market commentary. Our social media strategy allows us to continually enhance our brand reputation of expertise and thought leadership in the ETF industry. For example, we have an established presence on LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube, and our blog content is syndicated across multiple business-oriented websites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sales support. We create comprehensive materials to support our sales process including whitepapers, research reports, webinars, blogs, podcasts, videos and performance data for our ETFs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will continue to evolve our marketing and communication efforts in response to changes in the ETF industry, market conditions and marketing trends.

 Our research team has three core functions: index development and oversight, investment research and sales support. In its index development and oversight role, the research group is responsible for creating the investment methodologies and overseeing the maintenance of our indexes that the WisdomTree ETFs are designed to track. The team also provides a variety of investment research around these indexes and market segments. Our research is typically academic-type research to support our products, including white papers on the strategies underlying our indexes and ETFs, investment insights on current market trends, and types of investment strategies that drive long-term performance. We distribute our research through our sales professionals, online through our website and blog, targeted emails to financial advisors, or through financial media outlets. On some occasions, our research has been included in op-ed articles appearing various publications. Shorter research notes are also developed to promote our ideas, which are distributed online through social media channels. Finally, the research team supports our sales professionals in meetings as market experts and through custom analysis on client portfolio holdings. In addition, we consult with our senior advisers, including Professor Jeremy Siegel, on product development ideas and market commentaries. 
 Product Development 
 We are focused on driving continued growth through innovative product development including through our Modern Alpha approach which combines the outperformance potential of active management with the benefits of passive management to offer investors cost-effective funds that are built to perform. Due to our broad based regulatory exemptive relief, proprietary index development capabilities and a strategic focus on product development at the senior management level, we have demonstrated an ability to launch innovative and differentiated ETFs. When developing new funds, we seek to introduce products that can be first to market, offer improvement in structure or strategy relative to an incumbent product or offer some other key distinction relative to an incumbent product. In short, we want to add choice in the market and seek to introduce thoughtful investment solutions. Lastly, when launching new products, we seek to expand and diversify our overall product line. 
Competition 
 The asset management industry is highly competitive and we face substantial competition in virtually all aspects of our business. Factors affecting our business include fees for our products, investment performance, brand recognition, business reputation, quality of service and the continuity of our financial advisor relationships. We compete directly with other ETF sponsors and mutual fund companies and indirectly against other investment management firms, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that have similar features and investment objectives to those offered by us. The vast majority of the firms we compete with are subsidiaries of large diversified financial companies and many others are much larger in terms of AUM, years in operations and revenues and, accordingly, have much larger sales organizations and budgets. In addition, these larger competitors may attract business through means that are not available to us, including retail bank offices, investment banking, insurance agencies and broker-dealers. 
 The ETF industry is becoming significantly more competitive. Existing players have broadened their suite of products offering strategies that are, in some cases, similar to ours and large traditional asset managers are also launching ETFs, some with similar strategies as well. 
 There has also been increased price competition in not only commoditized product categories such as traditional, market capitalization weighted index exposures, but also in fundamental or other non-market capitalization weighted or factor-based exposures. Fee reduction by certain of our competitors has been a trend over the last few years and has recently accelerated. Funds are being offered with fees of 20 bps or less, which have attracted approximately 73% of the net flows globally during the last three years. However, while these low-cost ETFs have accumulated a significant amount of AUM recently, we estimate that these same funds represent only approximately 24% of global revenues. 
 
16 


 In the ETF industry, being a first mover, or one of the first providers of ETFs in a particular asset class, can also be a significant advantage, as the first ETF in a category to attract scale in AUM and trading liquidity is generally viewed as the most attractive ETF. We believe that our early launch of ETFs in a number of asset classes or strategies, including fundamental weighting and currency hedging along with certain fixed income categories, positions us well to maintain our position as one of the leaders of the ETF industry. Additionally, we believe our affiliated indexing or self-indexing model, as well as our more recent active ETFs, enable us to launch proprietary products that do not have exact competition and are positioned to generate alpha versus benchmarks. As investors increasingly become more comfortable with the ETF structure, we believe there will be a greater focus on after-fee performance, rather than using ETFs primarily as low-cost market access vehicles. While we have selectively lowered fee rates on certain products that have yet to attain scale, and there is no assurance that we will not lower fee rates on certain ETFs in the future, our strategy continues to include launching new funds in the same category with a differentiated exposure at a lower fee rate, rather than reducing fees on existing ETFs with a significant amount of AUM, long performance track records, and secondary market liquidity. We generally believe we are well positioned from a product pricing perspective. 
 We believe our ability to successfully compete will depend largely on our competitive product offerings and our ability to offer exposure to compelling investment strategies, develop distribution relationships, create new investment products, build trading volume, AUM and outperforming track records in existing funds, offer a diverse platform of investment choices, build upon our brand and attract and retain talented sales professionals and other employees. 
 U.S. Regulation 
 The investment management industry is subject to extensive regulation and virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and shareholders of registered investment companies. These laws generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business and to impose sanctions for failure to comply with these laws and regulations. Further, such laws and regulations provide the basis for examination, inquiry, investigation, enforcement action and/or litigation that may also result in significant costs to us. 
 We are primarily subject to the following laws and regulations, among others. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations have increased and will continue to contribute to the costs of doing business: 
 

 | The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Investment Advisers Act). The SEC is the federal agency generally responsible for administering the U.S. federal securities laws. WisdomTree Asset Management, Inc., or WTAM, one of our subsidiaries, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act and, as such, is regulated by the SEC. The Investment Advisers Act requires registered investment advisers to comply with numerous and broad obligations, including, among others, recordkeeping requirements, operational procedures, registration and reporting and disclosure obligations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Investment Company Act of 1940 (ICA). Nearly all of our WisdomTree ETFs are registered with the SEC pursuant to the Investment Company Act. These WisdomTree ETFs must comply with the requirements of the Investment Company Act and other regulations related to publicly offering and listing shares, as well as conditions imposed in the exemptive orders received by the ETFs, including, among others, requirements relating to operations, fees charged, sales, accounting, recordkeeping, disclosure and governance. In addition, the SEC has proposed, and is expected to continue to propose, new and/or revised provisions under the ICA that may impact current and future ETF investments and/or operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Broker-Dealer Regulations. Although we are not registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, nor are we a member firm of the
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
17 


 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, many of our employees, including all of our salespersons, are licensed with FINRA and are registered as associated persons of the distributor of the WisdomTree ETFs and, as such, are subject to the regulations of FINRA that relate to licensing, continuing education requirements and sales practices. FINRA also regulates the content of our marketing and sales material.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Internal Revenue Code. The WisdomTree Trust generally has obligations with respect to the qualification of the registered investment company for pass-through tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and National Futures Association (NFA). In 2012, the CFTC adopted regulations that have required us to become a member of the NFA and register as a commodity pool operator for a select number of our ETFs. In addition, in January 2016, we acquired the ownership interest in two commodity pool operators (one of which has since been dissolved) to ETFs that are not registered under the ICA and are thereby subject to additional requirements imposed by the CFTC and NFA. Each commodity pool operator is required to comply with numerous CFTC and NFA requirements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. This comprehensive overhaul of the financial services regulatory environment requires the implementation of numerous rules, which, as they continue to be adopted and/or modified, may impose additional regulatory burdens and expenses on our business, and may negatively impact WisdomTree ETFs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). We have established a platform for offering collective investment funds under the WisdomTree Collective Investment Trust, or CIT, to target the retirement sector. The CIT is exempt from registration with the SEC as a bank-maintained collective investment fund established for employee benefit trusts. As investment adviser to the CIT, WTAM will be subject to the fiduciary responsibility standards and prohibited transaction restrictions of ERISA and will be required to comply with certain requirements under ERISA to satisfy those standards and avoid liability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With respect to ETFs registered under the ICA, because such ETFs do not fit into the regulatory provisions governing mutual funds, ETF sponsors need to obtain from the SEC exemptive relief from certain provisions of the ICA in order to operate ETFs. This exemptive relief allows the ETF sponsor to bring products to market for the specific products or structures for which the relief was requested and obtained. Applying for exemptive relief can be costly and take several months to several years depending on the type of exemptive relief sought. In addition, each WisdomTree ETF is listed on a secondary market, (each, an Exchange) and any new WisdomTree ETF will seek listing on an Exchange and will also need to meet continued Exchange listing requirements. While the SEC has already approved rules for Exchanges to allow index-based ETFs and active ETFs to list that meet prescribed requirements (e.g., minimum number, market value and trading volume of securities in the new ETFs benchmark index or in its portfolio, as applicable), these rules do not allow ETFs that do not meet the prescribed requirements without specific SEC approval. The SEC approval process has historically taken months to complete and, in some cases, years. The SEC may ultimately determine not to allow such potential new WisdomTree ETFs or may require strategy modifications prior to approval. 
 FINRA rules and guidance may affect how WisdomTree ETFs are sold by member firms. Although we currently do not offer so-called leveraged ETFs in the U.S., which may include within their holdings derivative instruments such as options, futures or swaps to obtain leveraged exposures, recent FINRA guidance on margin requirements and suitability determinations with respect to customers trading in leveraged ETFs may influence how member firms effect sales of certain WisdomTree ETFs, such as our currency ETFs, which also use some forms of derivatives, including forward currency contracts and swaps, our international hedged equity ETFs, which use currency forwards, and our rising rates bond ETFs and alternative strategy ETFs, which use futures or options. In September 2015, FINRA issued an investor alert to help investors better understand smart beta products, or products that are linked to and seek to track the performance of alternatively weighted indices. 
 
18 


  FINRA also recently requested comment on potential changes to a rule related to payments to market makers and the potential consequences with respect to any changes to such rule are unclear. 
 Finally, our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are therefore also subject to its rules including corporate governance listing standards, as well as federal and state securities laws. In addition, the WisdomTree ETFs are listed on NYSE Arca, the NASDAQ Market and the BATS Exchange, and accordingly are subject to the listing requirements of those exchanges. 
 International Regulation 
 Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of various non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies. As we have expanded our international presence, a number of our subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems, in various jurisdictions, comparable to those covering our operations in the U.S. Regulators in these non-U.S. jurisdictions may have broad authority with respect to the regulation of financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. 
European and Jersey Regulation 
 We are subject to Jersey and European regulation of ETFS. We also are subject to European regulation of our WisdomTree UCITS and Boost ETPs. The applicable regulations are described as follows: 
ETFS 
 ETFS is comprised of Jersey-domiciled issuers of exchange-traded commodities, or ETC issuers, each of which were established as a special purpose vehicle to issue exchange-traded securities. All ETCs other than those issued by Swiss Commodity Securities Limited, or SCSL, are listed and marketed across the European Union, or EU, under the Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended by Directive 2010/73/EU), or the Prospectus Directive. The U.K. Listing Authority, or UKLA, approves all ETC Base Prospectuses as meeting the requirements imposed under U.K. and EU law pursuant to the Prospectus Directive. Such approval relates only to those securities to be admitted to trading on a regulated market for the purpose of Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (recast)  Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and the Council, or MiFID II, and/or which are to be offered to the public in any European Economic Area, or EEA, Member State. Each prospectus is prepared, and a copy of it is sent to the Jersey Financial Services Commission, in accordance with the Collective Investment Funds (Certified Funds  Prospectuses) (Jersey) Order 2012. Each ETC issuer has obtained a certificate under the Collective Investment Funds (Jersey) Law 1988, as amended, to enable it to undertake its functions in relation to the ETCs. The UKLA has, at the request of the relevant ETC issuer, notified the approval of the Base Prospectus in accordance with Article 18 of the Prospectus Directive to other EU listing authorities, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the U.K., by providing them with certificates of approval attesting that the Base Prospectus has been prepared in accordance with the Prospectus Directive. Each issuer may request the UKLA to provide competent authorities in other EEA Member States with such certificates for the purposes of making a public offer in such Member States and/or for admission to trading of all or any securities on a regulated market. 
 Pursuant to the UK European Referendum Act 2015, a referendum on the U.K.s membership in the EU was held on June 23, 2016, with the majority voting to leave the EU. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. government exercised its right under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union to leave the EU (referred to as Brexit). If the approval of the Base Prospectuses by UKLA as outlined above ceases to be possible or practical as a result of Brexit, we will work with an alternate EEA Member State regulator through whom we would seek approval and request passporting. Guidance released in January 2019 by the European Securities and Markets Authority, or ESMA, confirmed that it is not possible to receive a formal approval from an alternate regulator prior to the U.K. leaving the EU. The expectation is that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, this approval would be in place 
 
19 


  such that it is not expected to cause any disruption or alteration to the terms or nature of our products. However, the position of ESMA means that there may be a short time period, expected to be limited to one day, when the ETC issuers may not have EU prospectuses. If this period is extended for unforeseen reasons beyond one day, there may be an impact to the listing and distribution of our products. 
 The ETCs issued by SCSL are only offered and admitted to trading within Switzerland. A copy of the base prospectus of SCSL is delivered to the Registrar of Companies in Jersey in accordance with Article 5 of the Companies (General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002. 
 The ETC issuers are primarily subject to the following legislation and regulatory requirements: 
 

 | The Prospectus Directive. The Base Prospectus of each ETC issuer other than SCSL has been drafted, and any offer of ETCs in any EEA Member State that has implemented the Prospectus Directive is made in compliance with the Prospectus Directive and any relevant implementing measure in such Member States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Each ETC issuer is incorporated as a public limited liability company under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Therefore, the ETC issuers are required to comply with various obligations under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 such as, but not limited to, convening general meetings, keeping proper books and records and filing financial statements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, known as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). EMIR, which became effective on August 16, 2012, provides for certain over-the-counter, or OTC, derivative contracts to be submitted to central clearing and imposes margin posting and other risk mitigation techniques, reporting and record keeping requirements. The clearing obligations under EMIR are still under discussion, and currently there are no mandatory clearing obligations in relation to equity, FX or commodity derivatives. The clearing obligation only applies to EU-based financial counterparties (defined as those authorized under MiFID, CRR, AIFMD, UCITS or insurance regulations) or those non-financial entities that have a rolling three-month notional exposure above a certain amount (between 1 and 3 billion, depending on asset class), which means that the ETC issuers are not directly subject to these obligations, but could indirectly be subject to them by virtue of their interaction with EU-based financial counterparties. In terms of reporting obligations, being non-EU entities, the ETC issuers are only indirectly subject to such obligations when they interact with their EU-based financial counter-parties. Each ETC issuer has adhered to the 2013 EMIR Portfolio Reconciliation, Dispute Resolution and Disclosure Protocol published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.

 | Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on market abuse (the Regulation) and Directive 2014/57/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on criminal sanctions for market abuse (the Directive and, together with the Regulation, MAD). Obligations imposed on the relevant ETC issuer and distributor under MAD, which became effective on July 3, 2016, include the requirement to publish inside information in a public and timely manner, to prepare and maintain a list of insiders and to refrain from market manipulation.

 | Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (BMR). Supervised EU entities which issue financial instruments that reference a benchmark are required to comply with applicable obligations as set out under the BMR. The BMR was published on June 30, 2016 and the majority of the provisions became effective on January 1, 2018. The ETC issuers are non-EU entities and as a result, BMR application is very limited, although in some circumstances a few residual obligations could be deemed to be applicable because the ETCs are marketed across Europe.

 | Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 November 2014 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPS). PRIIPs became effective on January 1, 2018 and applies to investment product manufacturers and distributors. Under PRIIPs, manufacturers need to provide a key information document (KIDs) to investors. The intention of KIDs is to improve transparency for investors on the products and enhance investor protection. The product manufacturer is responsible for drafting the KID and for its content. All ETCs are currently subject to PRIIPs and KIDs have been produced since January 1, 2018.

 | MIFID II. MIFID II covers a wide range of areas that affect the relevant issuer and distributor, such as product governance, a new definition of complex products (which captures all physical and synthetic ETCs) and the production of a new document called an EMT to facilitate the dissemination of relevant information to the markets and distributors in relation to each financial product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Regulation (EU) 2015/2365 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on transparency of securities financing transactions and of reuse and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. (SFTR). Counterparties to securities financing transactions must report the transaction to trade repositories. The SFTR introduces a reporting requirement for transactions, and a disclosure requirement to investors with a requirement for prior consent. It also designates that financial instruments used for re-hypothecation are transferred to an account in the name of the other counterparty. Since the ETC issuers are based in non-EU jurisdictions, obligations are only indirectly applicable to them, but a certain level of interaction with EU counterparties is required to comply with some of these requirements.

 | The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which was passed as part of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, generally requires that foreign financial institutions and certain other non-financial foreign entities report on the foreign assets held by their U.S. account holders or be subject to withholding on withholdable payments. The HIRE Act also contained legislation requiring U.S. persons to report, depending on the value, their foreign financial accounts and foreign assets. ETCs benefit from the so called listing exemption and Jersey local authorities have determined that for companies which can benefit from such exemption the filing of a nil report is optional.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Common Reporting Standards, or CRS, were developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and is a global reporting standard for the automatic exchange of information. The ETC issuers will need to conduct FATCA style due diligence and annual local reporting in relation to financial accounts held directly and indirectly by residents of those jurisdictions with which the Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs) jurisdiction of residence has signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) to implement the CRS. Unlike FATCA, there is no clear listing exemption available under the CRS so the ETC issuers are required to conduct full due diligence to identify such accounts and report on them on an annual basis to their local tax authorities, at least in respect of the certificated interests and primary market issuances. However, Jersey tax authorities have applied less onerous reporting obligations to interests such as ETCs that are regularly traded on an established securities market and are held through CREST, the U.K. based central securities depository.

 WisdomTree UCITS ETFs 
 The investment management industry in Ireland is subject to both Irish domestic law and European Union law. The Central Bank of Ireland, or the Central Bank, is responsible for the authorization and supervision of collective investment schemes, or CIS, in Ireland. CISs are also commonly known as funds/schemes. There are two main categories of funds authorized by the Central Bank, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and funds that are not UCITS known as alternative investment funds. ETFs form part of the Irish and European regulatory frameworks that govern UCITS, with ETFs having been the subject of specific consideration at the European level which is then repeated and/or interpreted by the Central Bank in regulations and related guidance issued by the Central Bank. 
 
21 


 One of our subsidiaries, WisdomTree Management Limited, is an Ireland based management company authorized in Ireland providing collective portfolio management services to WisdomTree Issuer PLC, or WTI, and WisdomTree UCITS ETFs. The WisdomTree UCITS ETFs are issued by WTI. WTI, a non-consolidated third party, is a public limited company organized in Ireland and is authorized as a UCITS by the Central Bank. All UCITS have their basis in EU legislation and once authorized in one EEA Member State, may be marketed throughout the EU, without further authorization. This is described as an EU passport. Post Brexit, the WisdomTree UCITS ETFs are expected to continue to be available to U.K. investors under the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, Temporary Permissions Regime. 
 WTI is established and operated as a public limited company with segregated liability between its sub-funds. The sub-funds are segregated portfolios, each with their own investment objective and policies and assets. Each sub-fund has a separate approval from the Central Bank, and each is authorized as an ETF. Each sub-fund tracks a different index. The index must comply with regulatory criteria that govern, among others, the eligibility and diversification of its constituents, and the availability of information on the index such as the frequency of calculation of the index, the indexs transparency, its methodology and frequency of calculation. Each sub-fund is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and has shares admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange and, typically, on various European stock exchanges and, accordingly, is subject to the listing requirements of those exchanges. 
 WTI is primarily subject to the following legislation and regulatory requirements: 
 

 | European Communities (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2011 (as amended) (UCITS Regulations). The UCITS Regulations, which transpose Council Directive 2009/65/EC, Commission Directive 2010/43/EC and Commission Directive 2010/44/EC into Irish law, became effective on July 1, 2011. UCITS established in Ireland are authorized under the UCITS Regulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48(1)) (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) Regulations 2015 (Central Bank UCITS Regulations) (as amended) (Central Bank Acts). The Central Bank UCITS Regulations were adopted in November 2015 and, together with the UCITS Regulations, any guidance produced by the Central Bank, and the Central Bank forms, form the basis for all the requirements that the Central Bank imposes on UCITS, UCITS management companies and depositaries of UCITS.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Central Bank Guidance. The Central Bank also has produced guidance that provides direction on issues relating to the funds industry, certain of which set forth conditions not contained in the UCITS Regulations or the Central Bank Acts with which UCITS must conform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Companies Acts 2014 (Companies Act). WTI is incorporated as a public limited company under the Companies Act. Therefore, WTI is required to comply with various obligations under the Companies Act such as, but not limited to, convening general meetings and keeping proper books and records. The segregation of liability between sub-funds means there cannot be, as a matter of Irish law, cross-contamination of liability as between sub-funds so that the insolvency of one sub-fund affects another sub-fund.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | EMIR. EMIR provides for OTC derivative contracts to be submitted to central clearing and imposes, inter alia, margin posting and other risk mitigation techniques, reporting and record keeping requirements. WTI uses OTC derivatives instruments to hedge the currency risk of some of its sub-funds, which are subject to EMIR. WTI has adhered to the 2013 EMIR Portfolio Reconciliation, Dispute Resolution and Disclosure Protocol published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. The Central Bank has been designated as the competent authority for EMIR.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | BMR. The BMR is directly applicable law across the EU and applies to certain administrators, contributors and users of benchmarks with the aim of reducing the risk of benchmark manipulation and promoting confidence in their integrity and that of the financial markets which they support. Since
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
22 


 
WTI issues financial instruments that reference a benchmark, it will be required to comply with applicable obligations as set out under the BMR. In addition, non-EU administrators of benchmarks are required to satisfy a number of requirements to enable the benchmarks they provide to be used in the EU. To ensure investor protection, the BMR provides equivalence, recognition and endorsement conditions under which third country benchmarks may be used by supervised entities in the EU. Since we control the provision of benchmarks, we are required to comply with applicable obligations within the timeframes set out under the BMR.

 Boost ETPs 
 One of our subsidiaries, Boost Management Limited, is a Jersey based management company providing investment and other management services to Boost Issuer PLC, or BI, and the Boost ETPs. The Boost ETPs are issued by BI. BI, a non-consolidated third party, is a public limited company incorporated in the laws of Ireland. It was established as a special purpose vehicle for the purposes of issuing collateralized exchange-traded securities, or ETP Securities, under the Collateralized ETP Securities Programme described in its Base Prospectus. BI is a qualifying company within the meaning of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended), of Ireland. BI is not authorized or regulated by the Central Bank by virtue of issuing Boost ETPs. 
 The Central Bank, as competent authority under the Prospectus Directive, has approved the Base Prospectus as meeting the requirements imposed under Irish and EU law pursuant to the Prospectus Directive. Such approval relates only to ETP Securities which are to be admitted to trading on a regulated market for the purpose of MiFID II and/or which are to be offered to the public in any EEA Member State. We are in discussions with the FCA in respect of the Boost ETPs such that, if necessary, the Base Prospectus for those products could be approved by the FCA in addition to the existing Central Bank approval to ensure continuous offering in the U.K. post-Brexit. 
 The Central Bank has, at the request of BI, notified the approval of the Base Prospectus in accordance with Article 18 of the Prospectus Directive to the UKLA (the United Kingdom financial supervisory authority), the Commissione Nazionale per la Societá e la Borsa (the Italian financial supervisory authority), the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (the German Federal financial supervisory authority) and the Financial Market Authority of Austria, by providing them, inter alia, with certificates of approval attesting that the Base Prospectus has been prepared in accordance with the Prospectus Directive. BI may request the Central Bank to provide competent authorities in other EEA Member States with such certificates whether for the purposes of making a public offer in such Member States or for admission to trading of all or any ETP Securities on a regulated market therein or both. 
 BI is primarily subject to the following legislation and regulatory requirements: 
 

 | The Companies Act. BI is incorporated as a public limited liability company under the Companies Act. Therefore, BI is required to comply with various obligations under the Companies Act such as, but not limited to, convening general meetings, keeping proper books and records and filing financial statements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The Prospectus Directive. The Base Prospectus has been drafted, and any offer of ETP Securities in any EEA Member State that has implemented the Prospectus Directive is made in compliance with the Prospectus Directive and any relevant implementing measure in such Member States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | EMIR. BI hedges its payment obligations in respect of the ETP Securities by entering into swap transactions with swap providers, which are subject to EMIR. The Central Bank has been designated as the competent authority for EMIR and, to assess compliance with EMIR, requests that BI submits annually an EMIR Regulatory Return.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | BMR. Since BI issues financial instruments that reference a benchmark, it also will be required to comply with applicable obligations under the BMR.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23 


 
 | MAD. MAD has a direct effect in Ireland and strengthens the legal framework underpinning the function of detecting, sanctioning and deterring market abuse. Broadly, MAD applies to any financial instrument admitted to, or for which a request for admission has been made to, trading on a regulated market in at least one member state of the EU or in an EEA Member State. Obligations imposed on BI under MAD include the requirement to publish inside information in a public and timely manner, to draw up and maintain a list of insiders and to refrain from market manipulation.

Canadian Regulation 
 Our Toronto, Canada based subsidiary, WisdomTree Asset Management Canada, Inc., or WTAMC, is registered as an investment fund manager and exempt market dealer (a restricted broker/dealer license for the exempt market) in certain Canadian jurisdictions where such registration is required. WTAMCs registration as an investment fund manager enables it to act as fund manager to investment funds, including our Canadian ETFs, in Canada. WTAMC is a corporation incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) and must comply with various obligations under that Act including with respect to the appointment of directors and officers, the conduct of meetings of directors and shareholders and the maintaining of books and records. As a registered investment fund manager and exempt market dealer, WTAMC is subject to the requirements of applicable securities laws including National Instrument 31-103  Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations of the Canadian Securities Administrators, which prescribes registration requirements including proficiency requirements for certain individuals required to be registered on behalf of the firm, firm capital and reporting requirements, firm insurance coverage requirements and the requirement to establish and maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance by the firm and individuals acting on its behalf with applicable securities legislation. 
 Our Canadian ETFs are public investment funds whose units are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Our Canadian ETFs are in continuous distribution of their units and have filed prospectuses with the Canadian Securities Administrators in order to offer their units, which are required to be renewed annually. Our Canadian ETFs are subject to National Instrument 81-102  Investment Funds of the Canadian Securities Administrators, which sets out requirements relating to the investments and limitations on certain investment strategies that may be undertaken by public investment funds as well as requiring fund portfolio assets to be held by independent qualified financial institutions and prescribing that certain fundamental fund changes necessitate obtaining approval of unitholders. Our Canadian ETFs are also subject to National Instrument 81-106  Investment Fund Continuous Disclosure, which mandates the preparation and filing of annual audited and semi-annual unaudited financial statements for each fund as well as management reports of fund performance for the same periods which are required to be sent to unitholders of the fund. In addition, each of our Canadian ETFs also must prepare quarterly portfolio disclosure and annually prepare and make available its proxy voting disclosure, which is a record of how the fund voted the various portfolio securities held by it. Finally, National Instrument 81-107  Independent Review Committee for Investment Funds, requires public investment funds to have an independent review committee, or IRC, consisting of at least three members, each of whom must be independent of the fund manager, to review and approve or make a recommendation relating to conflict of interest matters referred to the IRC by the fund manager for consideration that may arise in the course of managing the operations of a fund. 
Japanese Regulation 
 In July 2018, we determined to restructure our distribution strategy in Japan resulting in the closure and wind down of our Japan-based subsidiary, WisdomTree Japan Inc., or WTJ. In January 2019, WTJ terminated its registration as a Type 1 Financial Instruments Business with the Kanto Local Finance Bureau (a part of Japans Ministry of Finance under authority delegated by the Financial Services Agency of Japan, or FSA). WTJ also withdrew as a member of the Japan Securities Dealers Association and the Japan Investor Protection Fund. WTJ has commenced the liquidation process, which is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2019.
