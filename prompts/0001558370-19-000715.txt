     Item 1. Business.
     General
     Hilltop Holdings Inc. is a diversified, Texas-based financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). Our primary line of business is to provide business and consumer banking services from offices located throughout Texas through the Bank. We also provide an array of financial products and services through our broker-dealer, mortgage origination and insurance segments. We endeavor to build and maintain a strong financial services company through organic growth as well as acquisitions, which we may make using available capital, excess liquidity and, if necessary or appropriate, additional equity or debt financing sources.

     PCC.  PCC is a financial holding company that provides, through its subsidiaries, traditional banking and wealth, investment and treasury management services primarily in Texas and residential mortgage loans throughout the United States.
     On August 1, 2018, we acquired privately-held, Houston-based The Bank of River Oaks (“BORO”) in an all-cash transaction (the “BORO Acquisition”). In connection with the acquisition, we merged BORO into the Bank, and all customer accounts were converted to the PlainsCapital Bank platform.
     Securities Holdings.  Securities Holdings is a holding company that provides, through its subsidiaries, investment banking and other related financial services, including municipal advisory, sales, trading and underwriting of taxable and tax-exempt fixed income securities, equity trading, clearing, securities lending, structured finance and retail brokerage services throughout the United States.

 Organizational Structure
     Our organizational structure is comprised of three primary business units: PCC (banking and mortgage origination); Securities Holdings (broker-dealer); and NLC (insurance). The following graphic provides additional details regarding our current organizational structure.
    
     Geographic Dispersion of our Businesses
     The Bank provides traditional banking and wealth, investment and treasury management services. The Bank has a presence in every major market in Texas and conducts substantially all of its banking operations in Texas. 
     Our broker-dealer services are provided through Hilltop Securities and HTS Independent Network, which conduct business nationwide. Public finance department net revenues represented 13% of total broker-dealer net revenues during 2018, and 70% of such public finance net revenues were from entities located in Texas. Additionally, retail brokerage service net revenues represented 30% of total broker-dealer net revenues during 2018, and 91% of such retail brokerage service revenues were generated through locations in Texas, California and Oklahoma.
     PrimeLending provides residential mortgage origination products and services from over 300 locations in 44 states. During 2018, an aggregate of 62.5% of PrimeLending’s origination volume was concentrated in ten states, with 37.5% concentrated in Texas, California and Florida, collectively. Other than these ten states, none of the states in which PrimeLending operated during 2018 represented more than 3% of PrimeLending’s origination volume.
     Our insurance products are distributed through a broad network of independent agents. During 2018, total gross premiums written were concentrated in five states (Texas, Arizona, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Georgia), with Texas insureds representing 68.2% of the aggregate. None of the other states in which we operated during 2018 had gross premiums written of 3% or more. 
         Business Segments
     Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), our business units are comprised of four reportable business segments organized primarily by the core products offered to the segments’ respective customers: banking, broker-dealer, mortgage origination and insurance. These segments reflect the manner in which operations are managed and the criteria used by our chief operating decision maker function to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy and allocate resources. Our chief operating decision maker function consists of our President and Co-Chief Executive Officer and our Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer. 
     Corporate includes certain activities not allocated to specific business segments. These activities include holding company financing and investing activities, merchant banking investment opportunities, and management and administrative services to support the overall operations of the Company. Hilltop’s merchant banking investment activities include the

identification of attractive opportunities for capital deployment in companies engaged in non-financial activities through its merchant bank subsidiary, Hilltop Opportunity Partners LLC, formerly known as PlainsCapital Equity, LLC.
     For more financial information about each of our business segments, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” herein. See also Note 30 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
     Banking
     The banking segment includes the operations of the Bank, which, at December 31, 2018, had $10.0 billion in assets and total deposits of $8.2 billion. The primary sources of our deposits are residents and businesses located in Texas. At December 31, 2018, the Bank employed approximately 1,200 people.
     The table below sets forth a distribution of the banking segment’s loans, classified by portfolio segment and segregated between those considered to be purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans and all other originated or acquired loans at December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands). PCI loans showed evidence of credit deterioration at the time of acquisition that made it probable that all contractually required principal and interest payments would not be collected. The commercial and industrial loans category includes $2.3 billion in warehouse lines of credit extended to PrimeLending, of which $1.2 billion was drawn at December 31, 2018. Amounts advanced against the warehouse line of credit are included in the table below, but are eliminated from net loans on our consolidated balance sheets.
    
 | | | | | | | | % of Total | 
 | Loans, excluding | | PCI | | Total Loans | Loans Held | 
 | PCI Loans | | Loans | | Held for Investment | for Investment | 
Commercial real estate: | | | | | | | | | 
Non-owner occupied | $ | 1,709,533 | | $ | 13,089 | $ | 1,722,622 | 22.8 | %

Commercial and industrial | | 2,695,408 | | | 6,559 | | 2,701,967 | 35.8 | %
Construction and land development | | 932,445 | | | 464 | | 932,909 | 12.4 | %
1-4 family residential | | 623,400 | | | 58,327 | | 681,727 | 9.0 | %

Total loans held for investment | $ | 7,455,003 | | $ | 93,072 | $ | 7,548,075 | 100.0 | %

      The loans acquired in the FDIC-assisted transaction in which we assumed substantially all of the liabilities and acquired substantially all of the assets of FNB (the “FNB Transaction”) were previously subject to loss-share agreements with the FDIC. At the close of business on September 30, 2018, the loss-share agreements for commercial assets with the FDIC expired, except for certain obligations on the part of the Bank that survived. On October 17, 2018, the Bank and the FDIC entered into a Termination Agreement pursuant to which all rights and obligations of the Bank and the FDIC under the FDIC loss-share agreements have been resolved and terminated. Accordingly, loans which were previously referred to as either “covered loans” if covered by the loss-share agreements or otherwise “non-covered loans” are now collectively referred to as “loans held for investment.”  
     Our lending policies seek to establish an asset portfolio that will provide a return on stockholders’ equity sufficient to maintain capital to assets ratios that meet or exceed established regulations. In support of that goal, we have designed our underwriting standards to determine:
     • that our borrowers possess sound ethics and competently manage their affairs;
 • that we know the source of the funds the borrower will use to repay the loan;
 • that the purpose of the loan makes economic sense; and
 • that we identify relevant risks of the loan and determine that the risks are acceptable.
     We implement our underwriting standards according to the facts and circumstances of each particular loan request, as discussed below.
     Business Banking.  Our business banking customers primarily consist of agribusiness, energy, health care, institutions of higher education, real estate (including construction and land development) and wholesale/retail trade companies. We provide these customers with extensive banking services, such as online banking, business check cards and other add-on 

 
  7

 
services as determined on a customer-by-customer basis. Our treasury management services, which are designed to reduce the time, burden and expense of collecting, transferring, disbursing and reporting cash, are also available to our business customers. We offer our business banking customers lines of credit, equipment loans and leases, letters of credit, agricultural loans, commercial real estate loans and other loan products.
     Commercial and industrial loans are primarily made within Texas and are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the debt from cash flow from an operating business. In general, commercial and industrial loans involve more credit risk than residential and commercial real estate loans and, therefore, usually yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial and industrial loans results primarily from the type of collateral securing these loans, which typically includes commercial real estate, accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. Additionally, increased risk arises from the expectation that commercial and industrial loans generally will be serviced principally from operating cash flow of the business, and such cash flows are dependent upon successful business operations. Historical trends have shown these types of loans to have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans. As a result of the additional risk and complexity associated with commercial and industrial loans, such loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than loans to individuals. To manage these risks, our policy is to attempt to secure commercial and industrial loans with both the assets of the borrowing business and other additional collateral and guarantees that may be available. In addition, depending on the size of the credit, we actively monitor the financial condition of the borrower by analyzing the borrower’s financial statements and assessing certain financial measures, including cash flow, collateral value and other appropriate credit factors. We also have processes in place to analyze and evaluate on a regular basis our exposure to industries, products, market changes and economic trends.
     The Bank offers term financing on commercial real estate that includes retail, office, multi-family, industrial and warehouse properties. Commercial mortgage lending can involve high principal loan amounts, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on a borrower’s ongoing business operations or on income generated from the properties that are leased to third parties. Accordingly, we apply the measures described above for commercial and industrial loans to our commercial real estate lending, with increased emphasis on analysis of collateral values. As a general practice, the Bank requires its commercial mortgage loans to (i) be secured with first lien positions on the underlying property, (ii) maintain adequate equity margins, (iii) be serviced by businesses operated by an established management team and (iv) be guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. The Bank seeks lending opportunities where cash flow from the collateral provides adequate debt service coverage and/or the guarantor’s net worth is comprised of assets other than the project being financed.
     The Bank also offers construction financing for (i) commercial, retail, office, industrial, warehouse and multi-family developments, (ii) residential developments and (iii) single family residential properties. Construction loans involve additional risks because loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. If the Bank is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, it may not be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. Additionally, the Bank may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. Because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. The Bank generally requires that the subject property of a construction loan for commercial real estate be pre-leased because cash flows from the completed project provide the most reliable source of repayment for the loan. Loans to finance these projects are generally secured by first liens on the underlying real property. The Bank conducts periodic completion inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans.
     In addition to the real estate lending activities described above, a portion of the Bank’s real estate portfolio consists of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans typically collateralized by owner occupied properties located in its market areas. These residential mortgage loans are generally secured by a first lien on the underlying property and have maturities up to 30 years. These loans are shown in the loans held for investment table above as “1-4 family residential.”
     The Bank’s mortgage warehouse lending activities consist of asset-based lending in which the Bank provides short-term, revolving lines of credit to independent mortgage bankers (“IMBs”). IMBs are generally small businesses, with mortgage loan origination and servicing as their sole or primary business. IMBs use the funds from their lines of credit to provide home loans to prospective and existing homeowners. When the IMBs subsequently sell the loans to institutional investors 

 
  8

 
in the secondary market—typically within 30 days of closing the transaction—they use the money received from the sale of the mortgage to replenish their lines of credit. 
     Personal Banking.  The Bank offers a broad range of personal banking products and services for individuals. Similar to its business banking operations, the Bank also provides its personal banking customers with a variety of add-on features such as check cards, safe deposit boxes, online banking, bill pay, overdraft privilege services and access to automated teller machine (ATM) facilities throughout the United States. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts to its personal banking customers including savings, checking, interest-bearing checking, money market and certificates of deposit.
     The Bank loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including lines of credit, home improvement loans, home equity loans, and loans for purchasing and carrying securities. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $47.5 million of loans for these purposes, which are shown in the loans held for investment table above as “Consumer.”
     Wealth and Investment Management.  The Bank’s private banking team personally assists high net worth individuals and their families with their banking needs, including depository, credit, asset management, and trust and estate services. The Bank offers trust and asset management services in order to assist these customers in managing, and ultimately transferring, their wealth. 
     The Bank’s wealth management services provide personal trust, investment management and employee benefit plan administration services, including estate planning, management and administration, investment portfolio management, employee benefit accounts and individual retirement accounts.
 Broker-Dealer
     The “Hilltop Broker-Dealers” include the operations of Hilltop Securities, a clearing broker-dealer subsidiary registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and a member of the NYSE, HTS Independent Network, an introducing broker-dealer subsidiary that is also registered with the SEC and FINRA, and Hilltop Securities Asset Management, LLC, formerly known as First Southwest Asset Management, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Southwest Holdings, LLC. Hilltop Securities and HTS Independent Network are both registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) as non-guaranteed introducing brokers and as members of the National Futures Association (“NFA”). Additionally, Hilltop Securities Asset Management, LLC, Hilltop Securities and HTS Independent Network are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. At December 31, 2018, Hilltop Securities had consolidated assets of $3.2 billion and net capital of $194.0 million, which was $183.1 million in excess of its minimum net capital requirement of $10.9 million. At December 31, 2018, the Hilltop Broker-Dealers employed approximately 800 people and maintained 53 locations in 20 states.
     Our broker-dealer segment has six primary lines of business: (i) public banking, (ii) capital markets, (iii) retail, (iv) structured finance, (v) clearing services, and (vi) securities lending.
     Public Banking.  Through its public finance and continuing disclosure departments, the public banking line of business assists public bodies nationwide, including cities, counties, school districts, utility districts, tax increment zones, special districts, state agencies and other governmental entities, in originating, syndicating and distributing securities of municipalities and political subdivisions. In addition, the public banking line of business provides specialized advisory and investment banking services for airports, convention centers, healthcare institutions, institutions of higher education, housing, industrial development agencies, toll road authorities, and public power and utility providers. The public finance and continuing disclosure departments generated 82% of the total public banking business line’s net revenues for the year-ended December 31, 2018.
     Additionally, through its arbitrage, treasury management and government investment pools management departments, the public banking line of business provides state and local governments with advice and assistance with respect to arbitrage rebate compliance, portfolio management and local government investment pool administration.
     Capital Markets.  The capital markets line of business specializes in trading and underwriting U.S. government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed, asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities and structured products to support sales and other customer activities, and trades equities and option orders on an agency basis on behalf of its retail and institutional clients, including corporations, insurance companies, banks, mutual funds, money managers and other clients. In addition, the capital markets group provides asset and liability 

 
  9

 
management advisory services to community banks. The equity trading department focuses on executing equity and option orders on an agency basis for clients, while the syndicate department, housed within its fixed income sales group, coordinates the distribution of managed and co-managed corporate equity underwritings, accepts invitations to participate in competitive or negotiated underwritings managed by other investment banking firms and allocates and markets the sales of allotments to institutional clients and to other broker-dealers.
     Retail.  The retail line of business acts as a securities broker for retail investors in the purchase and sale of securities, options, commodities and futures contracts that are traded on various exchanges or in the over-the-counter market through our employee-registered representatives or independent contractor arrangements. We extend margin credit on a secured basis to our retail customers in order to facilitate securities transactions. Through Southwest Insurance Agency, Inc. and Southwest Financial Insurance Agency, Inc., we hold insurance licenses to facilitate the sale of insurance and annuity products by Hilltop Securities and HTS Independent Network advisors to retail clients. We retain no underwriting risk related to these insurance and annuity products. In addition, through our investment management team, the retail group provides a number of advisory programs that offer advisors a wide array of products and services for their advisory businesses. In most cases, we charge commissions to our clients in accordance with an established commission schedule, subject to certain discounts based upon the client’s level of business, the trade size and other relevant factors. The HTS Independent Network advisors may also contract directly with third party carriers to sell specified insurance products to their customers. The commissions received from these third party carriers are paid directly to the advisor. Hilltop Securities is also a fully disclosed client of two of the largest futures commission merchants in the United States. At December 31, 2018, we employed 124 registered representatives in 17 retail brokerage offices and had contracts with 208 independent retail representatives for the administration of their securities business.
     Structured Finance. The structured finance line of business provides structured asset and liability services and commodity hedging advisory services to facilitate balance sheet management primarily to clients of the public finance department. In addition, the structured finance line of business participates in programs in which it issues forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities to certain non-profit housing clients and sells U.S. Agency to-be-announced (“TBA”) mortgage-backed securities.
     Clearing Services.  The clearing services line of business offers fully disclosed clearing services to FINRA- and SEC-registered member firms for trade execution and clearance as well as back office services such as record keeping, trade reporting, accounting, general back-office support, securities and margin lending, reorganization assistance and custody of securities. At December 31, 2018, we provided services to 152 financial organizations, including correspondent firms, correspondent broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, discount and full-service brokerage firms, and institutional firms.
     Securities Lending.  The securities lending line of business performs activities that include borrowing and lending securities for other broker-dealers, lending institutions, and internal clearing and retail operations. These activities involve borrowing securities to cover short sales and to complete transactions in which clients have failed to deliver securities by the required settlement date, and lending securities to other broker-dealers for similar purposes.
     Mortgage Origination
     Our mortgage origination segment operates through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, PrimeLending, which is a residential mortgage banker licensed to originate and close loans in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. PrimeLending primarily originates its mortgage loans through a retail channel, with limited lending through its affiliated business arrangements (“ABAs”). During 2018, funded loan volume through ABAs was approximately 6% of the mortgage origination segment’s total loan volume. At December 31, 2018, our mortgage origination segment operated from over 300 locations in 44 states, originating 19.0%, 11.0% and 7.5%, respectively, of its mortgage loans (by dollar volume) from its Texas, California and Florida locations. The mortgage lending business is subject to variables that can impact loan origination volume, including seasonal and interest rate fluctuations. Historically, the mortgage origination segment has typically experienced increased loan origination volume from purchases of homes during the spring and summer, when more people tend to move and buy or sell homes. An increase in mortgage interest rates tends to result in decreased loan origination volume from refinancings, while a decrease in mortgage interest rates tends to result in increased loan origination volume from refinancings. Changes in interest rates have historically had a lesser impact on home purchases volume than on refinancing volume.

 PrimeLending handles loan processing, underwriting and closings in-house. Mortgage loans originated by PrimeLending are funded through warehouse lines of credit maintained with the Bank. PrimeLending sells substantially all mortgage loans it originates to various investors in the secondary market, the majority servicing released. PrimeLending’s determination of whether to retain or release servicing on mortgage loans it sells is impacted by, among other things, changes in mortgage interest rates, and refinancing and market activity. PrimeLending may, from time to time, manage its related mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) assets through different strategies, including varying the percentage of mortgage loans sold servicing released and opportunistically selling MSR assets. As mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market, PrimeLending pays down its warehouse lines of credit with the Bank. Loans sold are subject to certain standard indemnification provisions with investors, including the repurchase of loans sold and the repayment of sales proceeds to investors under certain conditions.
     Our mortgage lending underwriting strategy, driven in large measure by secondary market investor standards, seeks primarily to originate conforming loans. Our underwriting practices include:
    
· | granting loans on a sound and collectible basis;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the loan; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ensuring that each loan is properly documented and, if appropriate, adequately insured.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      PrimeLending had a staff of approximately 2,650 people, including approximately 1,350 mortgage loan officers, as of December 31, 2018 that produced $13.7 billion in closed mortgage loan volume during 2018, 86% of which related to home purchases volume. PrimeLending offers a variety of loan products catering to the specific needs of borrowers seeking purchase or refinancing options, including 30-year and 15-year fixed rate conventional mortgages, adjustable rate mortgages, jumbo loans, and Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), Veterans Affairs (“VA”), and United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) loans. Mortgage loans originated by PrimeLending are secured by a first lien on the underlying property. PrimeLending does not currently originate subprime loans (which it defines to be conventional and government loans that (i) are ineligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) or Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), or (ii) do not comply with approved investor-specific underwriting guidelines).
     Insurance
     The operations of NLC comprise our insurance segment. NLC specializes in providing fire and limited homeowners insurance for low value dwellings and manufactured homes primarily in Texas and other areas of the southern, southeastern and southwestern United States through its subsidiaries, NLIC and ASIC. NLC’s product lines also include enhanced homeowners products offering higher coverage limits with distribution restricted to select agents. NLC targets underserved markets through a broad network of independent agents primarily located in Texas, Arizona, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Georgia.
     Ratings.  Many insurance buyers, agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other rating agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they purchase insurance. The financial strength ratings for NLIC and ASIC of “A” (Excellent) were affirmed by A.M. Best in June 2018. An “A” rating is the third highest of 16 rating categories used by A.M. Best. This rating assignment is subject to the ability to meet A.M. Best’s expectations as to performance and capitalization on an ongoing basis, and is subject to revocation or revision at any time at the sole discretion of A.M. Best. NLC cannot ensure that NLIC and ASIC will maintain their present ratings.
     Product Lines.  NLC’s business is focused on personal lines, specializing in low value dwellings and manufactured housing. Personal lines offered include homeowners, dwelling fire, manufactured home and flood policies. 
     NLC specializes in writing fire and homeowners insurance coverage for low value dwellings and manufactured homes. The vast majority of NLC’s property coverage is written on policies that provide actual cash value payments, as opposed to replacement cost. Under actual cash value policies, the insured is entitled to receive only the cost of replacing or repairing damaged or destroyed property with comparable new property, less depreciation. Replacement cost coverage does not include such a deduction for depreciation; however, it does include limited water coverage.

 Underwriting and Pricing.  NLC applies its regional expertise, underwriting discipline and a risk-adjusted, return-on-equity-based approach to capital allocation to primarily offer short-tail insurance products in its target markets. NLC’s underwriting process involves securing an adequate level of underwriting information from its independent agents, identifying and evaluating risk exposures and then pricing the risks it chooses to accept. Management reviews pricing on an ongoing basis to monitor any emerging issues on a specific coverage or geographic territory.
     Catastrophe Exposure.  NLC maintains a comprehensive risk management strategy, which includes actively monitoring its catastrophe-prone territories by zip code to ensure a diversified book of risks. NLC utilizes software and risk support from its reinsurance brokers to analyze its portfolio and catastrophe exposure. Biannually, NLC has its entire portfolio analyzed by its reinsurance broker who utilizes hurricane and severe storm models to predict risk.
     Reinsurance.  NLC purchases reinsurance to reduce its exposure to liability on individual risks and claims and to protect against catastrophe losses. NLC’s management believes that less volatile, yet reasonable returns are in the long-term interest of NLC.
     Reinsurance involves an insurance company transferring, or ceding, a portion of its risk to another insurer, the reinsurer.  The reinsurer assumes the exposure in return for a portion of the premium. The ceding of risk to a reinsurer does not legally discharge the primary insurer from its liability for the full amount of the policies on which it obtains reinsurance.  
 Accordingly, the primary insurer remains liable for the entire loss if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement and, as a result, the primary insurer is exposed to the risk of non-payment by its reinsurers. In formulating its reinsurance programs, NLC believes that it is selective in its choice of reinsurers and considers numerous factors, the most important of which are the financial stability of the reinsurer, its history of responding to claims and its overall reputation.
     Additionally, NLC further reduces its exposure to liability through an underlying excess of loss contract that provides aggregate coverage in excess of NLC’s per event retention and aggregate retention for sub-catastrophic events. 
     Competition
     We face significant competition in the business segments in which we operate and the geographic markets we serve. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, lending limits and branch networks than we do, and offer a broader range of products and services. 
     Our banking segment primarily competes with national, regional and community banks within the various markets where the Bank operates. The Bank also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, pension trusts, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based non-bank lenders, government agencies and certain other non-financial institutions. The ability to attract and retain skilled lending professionals is critical to our banking business. Competition for deposits and in providing lending products and services to consumers and businesses in our market area is intense and pricing is important. Other factors encountered in competing for deposits are convenient office locations, interest rates and fee structures of products offered. Direct competition for deposits also comes from other commercial bank and thrift institutions, money market mutual funds and corporate and government securities that may offer more attractive rates than insured depository institutions are willing to pay. Competition for loans is based on factors such as interest rates, loan origination fees and the range of services offered by the provider. We seek to distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our commitment to personalized customer service and responsiveness to customer needs while providing a range of competitive loan and deposit products and other services.
     Within our broker-dealer segment, we face significant competition based on a number of factors, including price, perceived expertise, quality of advice, reputation, range of services and products, technology, innovation and local presence. Competition for successful securities traders, stock loan professionals and investment bankers among securities firms and other competitors is intense. Our broker-dealer business competes directly with numerous other financial advisory and investment banking firms, broker-dealers and banks, including large national and major regional firms and smaller niche companies, some of whom are not broker-dealers and, therefore, are not subject to the broker-dealer regulatory framework. Further, our broker-dealer segment competes with discount brokerage firms that do not offer equivalent services but offer discounted prices. We seek to distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our commitment to personalized customer service and responsiveness to customer needs while providing a range of investment banking, advisory and other related financial brokerage services.

     Our competitors in the mortgage origination business include large financial institutions as well as independent mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations. Our mortgage origination segment competes on a number of factors including customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates, closing process and duration, and loan origination fees. The ability to attract and retain skilled mortgage origination professionals is critical to our mortgage origination business. We seek to distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our commitment to personalized customer service and responsiveness to customer needs while providing a range of competitive mortgage loan products and services.
     Our insurance business competes with a large number of other companies in its selected lines of business, including major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers, regional companies, mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies and diversified financial services companies. The personal lines market in Texas is dominated by a few large carriers and their subsidiaries and affiliates. We seek to distinguish ourselves from our competitors by targeting underserved market segments that provide us with the best opportunity to obtain favorable policy terms, conditions and pricing.
     Overall, competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technological advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies, with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, including online checking, savings and brokerage accounts, online lending, online insurance underwriters, crowdfunding, digital wallets, and money transfer services. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. 
     Employees
     At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 5,200 people, substantially all of which are full-time. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or a party to any collective bargaining agreement.     Government Supervision and Regulation
     General
     We are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of customers and clients, and not for the protection of our stockholders or creditors. In many cases, the applicable regulatory authorities have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies, banks and their subsidiaries, including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of laws and regulations. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to us and our subsidiaries. References in this Annual Report to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries thereof, do not purport to be complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations.
     On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which significantly altered the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Several aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act have affected our business, including, without limitation, increased capital requirements, increased mortgage regulation, restrictions on proprietary trading in securities, restrictions on investments in hedge funds and private equity funds (the “Volcker Rule”), executive compensation restrictions, potential federal oversight of the insurance industry and disclosure and reporting requirements.
     Recent Regulatory Developments. New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed and/or adopted that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating and doing business in the United States. Changes in leadership at various federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve, can also change the policy direction of these agencies. Certain of these recent proposals and changes are described below.
     On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), which included amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes that provide the federal banking agencies with the ability to tailor various provisions of the banking laws and eased the regulatory burden imposed 

 
  13

 
by the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to company-run stress testing, resolutions plans, Volcker Rule, high volatility commercial real estate exposures, and real estate appraisals.  
     In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that it intends to cease compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. 
     We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute.
     Corporate
     Hilltop is a legal entity separate and distinct from PCC and its other subsidiaries. On November 30, 2012, concurrent with the consummation of the acquisition of PlainsCapital Corporation (the “PlainsCapital Merger”), Hilltop became a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act”). Accordingly, it is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The Dodd-Frank Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Bank Holding Company Act and other federal laws subject financial and bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations.
     Changes of Control.  Federal and state laws impose additional notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a regulated holding company, such as Hilltop. These laws include the Bank Holding Company Act, the Change in Bank Control Act and the Texas Insurance Code. Among other things, these laws require regulatory filings by an investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a regulated holding company. The determination whether an investor “controls” a regulated holding company is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, an investor may be presumed to control the regulated holding company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock. Accordingly, these laws would apply to a person acquiring 10% or more of Hilltop’s common stock. Furthermore, these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent change of control transactions, including those that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.
     Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends; Source of Strength. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress; however, no such proposed regulations have yet been published.
     Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support. Such support may be required at times when, absent this Federal Reserve Board policy, a holding company may not be inclined to provide it. As discussed herein, a bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary.
     Scope of Permissible Activities. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, Hilltop and PCC generally may not acquire a direct or indirect interest in, or control of more than 5% of, the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company. Additionally, the Bank Holding Company Act may prohibit Hilltop from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to, or performing services for, its subsidiaries, except that it may engage in, directly or indirectly, certain activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be 

 
  14

 
closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In approving acquisitions or the addition of activities, the Federal Reserve Board considers, among other things, whether the acquisition or the additional activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh such possible adverse effects as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, effective March 11, 2000, eliminated the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other financial service providers and permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act defines “financial in nature” to include: securities underwriting; dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking. Prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulatory approval was not required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that were financial in nature or incidental to activities that were financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board.
     Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a bank holding company may become a financial holding company by filing a declaration with the Federal Reserve Board if each of its subsidiary banks is “well capitalized” under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act prompt corrective action provisions, is “well managed”, and has at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the “CRA”). The Dodd-Frank Act underscores the criteria for becoming a financial holding company by amending the Bank Holding Company Act to require that bank holding companies be “well capitalized” and “well managed” in order to become financial holding companies. Hilltop became a financial holding company on December 1, 2012.
     Safe and Sound Banking Practices. Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. In addition, bank holding companies are required to consult with the Federal Reserve Board prior to making any redemption or repurchase, even within the foregoing parameters. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.
     The Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or that constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing or reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $2.01 million for each day the activity continues. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to require reports from and examine bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, and to regulate functionally regulated subsidiaries of bank holding companies.
     Anti-tying Restrictions. Subject to various exceptions, bank holding companies and their affiliates are generally prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to certain other services offered by a bank holding company or its affiliates.
     Capital Adequacy Requirements and BASEL III. Hilltop and PlainsCapital, which includes the Bank and PrimeLending, are subject to capital adequacy requirements under the comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations known as “Basel III”. Basel III, which reformed the existing frameworks under which U.S. banking organizations historically operated, became effective January 1, 2015 and is fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. Basel III was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and adopted by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
     The federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum 

 
  15

 
ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
     Final rules published by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, Basel III increased minimum capital requirements, introduced a new minimum leverage ratio and implemented a capital conservation buffer. The regulatory agencies carefully considered the potential impacts on all banking organizations, including community and regional banking organizations such as Hilltop and PlainsCapital, and sought to minimize the potential burden of these changes where consistent with applicable law and the agencies’ goals of establishing a robust and comprehensive capital framework. Under the guidelines in effect beginning January 1, 2015, a risk weight factor of 0% to 1250% is assigned to each category of assets based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset class. The risk weights are then multiplied by the corresponding asset balances to determine a “risk-weighted” asset base.
     Under Basel III, total capital consists of two tiers of capital, Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 1 capital consists of common equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. Below is a list of certain significant components that comprise the tiers of capital for Hilltop and PlainsCapital under Basel III.
     Common equity Tier 1 capital:

· | includes common stockholders’ equity (such as qualifying common stock and any related surplus, undivided profits, disclosed capital reserves that represent a segregation of undivided profits and foreign currency translation adjustments, excluding changes in other comprehensive income (loss) and treasury stock);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | includes certain minority interests in the equity capital accounts of consolidated subsidiaries; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | excludes goodwill and various intangible assets.
--+-------------------------------------------------

      Additional Tier 1 capital:

· | includes certain qualifying minority interests not included in common equity Tier 1 capital;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | includes certain preferred stock and related surplus;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | includes certain subordinated debt; and
--+----------------------------------------


· | excludes 50% of the insurance underwriting deduction.
--+------------------------------------------------------

      Tier 2 capital:

· | includes allowance for loan losses, up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | includes minority interests not included in Tier 1 capital; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | excludes 50% of the insurance underwriting deduction.
--+------------------------------------------------------

      Hilltop and PlainsCapital began transitioning to the Basel III final rules on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer and certain deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital are fully phased in as of January 1, 2019.
     The following table summarizes the Basel III phase-in schedule for periods beginning January 1, 2018.
    
Year (as of January 1) | 2018 | | 2019 | 
Minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio | 4.5 | % | 4.5 | %
Common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer | 1.875 | % | 2.5 | %
Minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer | 6.375 | % | 7.0 | %
Minimum Tier 1 capital ratio | 6.0 | % | 6.0 | %
Minimum Tier 1 capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer | 7.875 | % | 8.5 | %
Minimum total capital ratio | 8.0 | % | 8.0 | %
Minimum total capital ratio plus capital conservation buffer | 9.875 | % | 10.5 | %
Phase-in of certain capital deductions (1) | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

(1) | In November 2017, the regulatory agencies finalized a rule that extends the phase-in schedule for certain capital deductions, including 10% and 15% common equity Tier 1 threshold deduction items that are over the limits, minority interest and significant and non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. Other capital deductions, such as intangible assets and deferred tax assets arising from net operating losses, are subject to the original phase-in schedule. The rule became effective on January 1, 2018.

      In order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, stock repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, Basel III also implemented a capital conservation buffer, which requires a banking organization to hold a buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer helps to ensure that banking organizations conserve capital when it is most needed, allowing them to better weather periods of economic stress. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. 
     The rules also prohibit a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% would not be subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments; however, a banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. When the rules are fully phased-in in 2019, the minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer will exceed the prompt corrective action well-capitalized thresholds. During 2018, our eligible retained income was positive and our capital conservation buffer was greater than 2.5%, and therefore, we were not subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. We anticipate similar results during 2019.
     At December 31, 2018, Hilltop had a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 17.47%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 17.04% and a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 16.58%. Hilltop’s actual capital amounts and ratios in accordance with Basel III exceeded the regulatory capital requirements including conservation buffer in effect at the end of the period and on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were currently in effect.
     At December 31, 2018, PlainsCapital had a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 14.63%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 13.90% and a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 13.90%.  Accordingly, PlainsCapital’s actual capital amounts and ratios in accordance with Basel III resulted in it being considered “well-capitalized” and exceeded the regulatory capital requirements including conservation buffer in effect at the end of the period and on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were currently in effect.
     Phase-in of Current Expected Credit Losses Accounting Standard. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an update to the accounting standards for credit losses that included the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) methodology, which replaces the existing incurred loss methodology for certain financial assets. CECL becomes effective January 1, 2020. In December 2018, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase-in, over a period of three years, the day-one regulatory capital effects resulting from the implementation of CECL. The final rule also revises the agencies’ other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards. 
     Volcker Rule.  Provisions of the Volcker Rule and the final rules implementing the Volcker Rule restrict certain activities provided by the Company, including proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in “covered funds,” which include many venture capital, private equity and hedge funds. For purposes of the Volcker Rule, purchases or sales of financial instruments such as securities, derivatives, contracts of sale of commodities for future delivery or options on the foregoing for the purpose of short-term gain are deemed to be proprietary trading (with financial instruments held for less than 60 days presumed to be for proprietary trading unless an alternative purpose can be demonstrated), unless certain exemptions apply. Exempted activities include, among others, the following: (i) underwriting; (ii) market making; (iii) risk mitigating hedging; (iv) trading in certain government securities; (v) employee compensation plans and (vi) transactions entered into on behalf of and for the account of clients as agent, broker, custodian, or in a trustee or fiduciary capacity. On December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies invited public comment on a proposal to implement provisions of EGRRCPA that would exclude community banks with $10.0 billion or less in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets from the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. At this time the, we do not anticipate that the Bank would qualify for this proposed exclusion. While management continues to assess compliance with the Volcker Rule, we have reviewed our processes and procedures in regard to proprietary trading and covered funds activities and we believe we are currently complying with the provisions of the 

 
  17

 
Volcker Rule. However, it remains uncertain how the scope of applicable restrictions and exceptions will be interpreted and administered by the relevant regulators. Absent further regulatory guidance, we are required to make certain assumptions as to the degree to which our activities, processes and procedures in these areas comply with the requirements of the Volcker Rule. If these assumptions are not accurate or if our implementation of compliance processes and procedures is not consistent with regulatory expectations, we may be required to make certain changes to our business activities, processes or procedures, which could further increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs.
     Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank, if after such acquisition it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and various competitive factors. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to consider “the risk to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system” when evaluating acquisitions of banks and nonbanks under the Bank Holding Company Act. With respect to interstate acquisitions, the Dodd-Frank Act amends the Bank Holding Company Act by raising the standard by which interstate bank acquisitions are permitted from a standard that the acquiring bank holding company be “adequately capitalized” and “adequately managed”, to the higher standard of being “well capitalized” and “well managed”.
     Control Acquisitions. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve Board, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute acquisition of control of such company.
     Banking
     The Bank is subject to various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States, and to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Texas Department of Banking. The Bank, as a state member bank, is also subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a bank with less than $10 billion in assets, the Bank became subject to the regulations issued by the CFPB on July 21, 2011, although the Federal Reserve Board continued to examine the Bank for compliance with federal consumer protection laws. As of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018, the Bank’s total assets were $9.9 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively. If the Bank’s total assets are over $10.0 billion (as measured on four consecutive quarterly call reports of the Bank and any institutions it acquires), the Bank will become subject to the CFPB’s supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws beginning in the following quarter. 
     The Bank is also an insured depository institution and, therefore, subject to regulation by the FDIC, although the Federal Reserve Board is the Bank’s primary federal regulator. The Federal Reserve Board, the Texas Department of Banking, the CFPB and the FDIC have the power to enforce compliance with applicable banking statutes and regulations. Such requirements and restrictions include requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon and restrictions relating to investments and other activities of the Bank. In July 2010, the FDIC voted to revise its agreement with the primary federal regulators to enhance the FDIC’s existing backup authorities over insured depository institutions that the FDIC does not directly supervise. As a result, the Bank may be subject to increased supervision by the FDIC.
     Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between the Bank and its nonbanking affiliates, including Hilltop and PCC, are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, Section 23A imposes limits on the amount of such transactions, and also requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of Hilltop or its subsidiaries. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act expands the definition of “covered transactions” and clarifies the amount of time that the collateral requirements must be satisfied for covered transactions, and amends the definition of “affiliate” in Section 23A to include “any investment fund with respect to which a member bank or an affiliate thereof is an investment adviser.”
    
 
  18

 

 Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which generally requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated persons. The Federal Reserve has also issued Regulation W, which codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions.
     Loans to Insiders. The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their related interests (collectively referred to herein as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all insured institutions and their subsidiaries and holding companies. These restrictions include conditions that must be met before insider loans can be made, limits on loans to an individual insider and an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests. These loans cannot exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the Federal Reserve Board may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. Insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act amends the statutes placing limitations on loans to insiders by including credit exposures to the person arising from a derivatives transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction between the member bank and the person within the definition of an extension of credit.
     Restrictions on Distribution of Subsidiary Bank Dividends and Assets. Dividends paid by the Bank have provided a substantial part of PCC’s operating funds and for the foreseeable future it is anticipated that dividends paid by the Bank to PCC will continue to be PCC’s and Hilltop’s principal source of operating funds. Capital adequacy requirements serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Pursuant to the Texas Finance Code, a Texas banking association may not pay a dividend that would reduce its outstanding capital and surplus unless it obtains the prior approval of the Texas Banking Commissioner. Additionally, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board have the authority to prohibit Texas state banks from paying a dividend when they determine the dividend would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank must also comply with the dividend restrictions with which a national bank would be required to comply. Those provisions are generally similar to those imposed by the state of Texas. Among other things, the federal restrictions require that if losses have at any time been sustained by a bank equal to or exceeding its undivided profits then on hand, no dividend may be paid.
     In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its stockholders, including any depository institution holding company (such as PCC and Hilltop) or any stockholder or creditor thereof.
     Branching. The establishment of a bank branch must be approved by the Texas Department of Banking and the Federal Reserve Board, which consider a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. The regulators will also consider the applicant’s CRA record. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, de novo interstate branching by banks is permitted if, under the laws of the state where the branch is to be located, a state bank chartered in that state would be permitted to establish a branch.
     Prompt Corrective Action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (“well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”) in which all institutions are placed. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category.
     An institution that is categorized as “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company’s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, 

 
  19

 
making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital. PlainsCapital was classified as “well capitalized” at December 31, 2018.
     Pursuant to FDICIA, an “undercapitalized” bank is prohibited from increasing its assets, engaging in a new line of business, acquiring any interest in any company or insured depository institution, or opening or acquiring a new branch office, except under certain circumstances, including the acceptance by the federal banking regulators of a capital restoration plan for the bank.
     FDIC Insurance Assessments. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities. The system assigns an institution to one of three capital categories: (1) “well capitalized;” (2) “adequately capitalized;” or (3) “undercapitalized.” These three categories are substantially similar to the prompt corrective action categories described above, with the “undercapitalized” category including institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized for prompt corrective action purposes. The FDIC also assigns an institution to one of three supervisory subgroups based on a supervisory evaluation that the institution’s primary federal regulator provides to the FDIC and information that the FDIC determines to be relevant to the institution’s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds. The FDIC may terminate its insurance of deposits if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
     The FDIC is required to maintain a designated reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund (“DIF”) to insured deposits in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to assess insured depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least 1.35% by September 30, 2020. On November 28, 2018, the FDIC announced that the DIF reserve ratio exceeded the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%, ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline. FDIC regulations provide for two changes to deposit insurance assessments upon reaching the minimum ratio: (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10.0 billion or more (large banks) will cease; and (2) small banks will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%. Pursuant to its authority in the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC on December 20, 2010, published a final rule establishing a higher long-term target DIF ratio of greater than 2%. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC and will be impacted by the overall economy and the stability of the banking industry as a whole. The FDIC will notify the Bank concerning any assessment credits and the assessment rate that we will be charged for the assessment period. As a result of the new regulations, we expect to incur lower annual deposit insurance assessments, which could have a positive impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Accruals for DIF assessments were $2.5 million during 2018.
     The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.
     Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA requires, in connection with examinations of financial institutions, that federal banking regulators (in the Bank’s case, the Federal Reserve Board) evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on the Bank. Additionally, the Bank must publicly disclose the terms of various CRA-related agreements.
     The Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in connection with its most recent CRA performance evaluation. A CRA rating of less than “satisfactory” adversely affects a bank’s ability to establish new branches and impairs a bank’s ability to commence new activities that are “financial in nature” or acquire companies engaged in these activities. See “Risk Factors — We are subject to extensive supervision and regulation that could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business and limit our ability to generate income.”
     Privacy. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with 

 
  20

 
a nonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. The Bank and all of its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to comply with the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.
     Federal Laws Applicable to Credit Transactions. The loan operations of the Bank are also subject to federal laws and implementing regulations applicable to credit transactions, such as the Truth-In-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.
     Federal Laws Applicable to Deposit Operations. The deposit operations of the Bank are subject to the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Truth in Savings Act and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve Board and the CFPB to implement that act. The Dodd-Frank Act amends the Electronic Funds Transfer Act to, among other things, give the Federal Reserve Board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer.
     Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board and the Texas Department of Banking monitor the capital adequacy of PlainsCapital by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios. The agencies consider PlainsCapital’s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system.
     Under the regulatory capital guidelines within the Basel III capital rules, PlainsCapital must maintain a total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.0%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, and a Tier 1 capital to average total assets ratio of at least 4.0% (3.0% for banks receiving the highest examination rating) to be considered “adequately capitalized.” See the discussion herein under “The FDIC Improvement Act.” At December 31, 2018, PlainsCapital’s ratio of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.63%, PlainsCapital’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 13.90%, PlainsCapital’s common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 13.90%, and PlainsCapital’s ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets was 12.47%.
     On January 1, 2015, PlainsCapital began transitioning to the final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. For additional discussion of Basel III, see the section entitled “Government Supervision and Regulation — Corporate — Capital Adequacy Requirements and Basel III” earlier in this Item 1.
     The FDIC Improvement Act. FDICIA made a number of reforms addressing the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system, supervision of domestic and foreign depository institutions, and improvement of accounting standards. This statute also limited deposit insurance coverage, implemented changes in consumer protection laws and provided for least-cost resolution and prompt regulatory action with regard to troubled institutions.
     FDICIA requires every bank with total assets in excess of $500 million to have an annual independent audit made of the bank’s financial statements by a certified public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented in accordance with GAAP and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the FDIC.
     Brokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits, depending on their capital classification. “Well capitalized” banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but banks that are not “well capitalized” are not permitted to accept such deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are “adequately capitalized” to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank. Pursuant to a provision in EGRRCPA, the FDIC proposed exempting certain reciprocal deposits from being considered as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions. The FDIC also plans to seek comments on the FDIC’s overall brokered deposit regulations. At December 31, 2018, PlainsCapital was “well capitalized” and therefore not subject to any limitations with respect to its brokered deposits.

 Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act gives “substitute checks,” such as a digital image of a check and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check.
     Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system, of which the Bank is a member, consists of regional FHLBs governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Board. The FHLBs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions. The reserves are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. The FHLBs make loans (i.e., advances) to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB and the boards of directors of each regional FHLB.
     As a system member, according to currently existing policies and procedures, the Bank is entitled to borrow from the FHLB of its respective region and is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. The Bank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules with respect to such advances, commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to the Bank are secured by a portion of the respective mortgage loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by the Bank.
     Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act). The FAST Act, signed by President Obama on December 4, 2015, provides for funding highways and infrastructure in the United States. Part of the funding for this law comes from a reduction of the dividends paid by the Federal Reserve to its stockholders with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, effective January 1, 2016. On that date, the annual dividend on paid-in capital stock for stockholders with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion shall be the lesser of: (i) the rate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of such dividend and (ii) 6 percent. The Federal Reserve Board published a final rule implementing these requirements on November 23, 2016. On November 13, 2017, the Federal Reserve published its annual adjustment to the consolidated asset threshold, increasing it to $10.283 billion through December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s total assets were $10.0 billion.
     Anti-terrorism and Money Laundering Legislation. The Bank is subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism of 2001, as amended (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), the Bank Secrecy Act and rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specific financial transactions and account relationships intended to guard against money laundering and terrorism financing. The Bank has established a customer identification program pursuant to Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, and otherwise has implemented policies and procedures intended to comply with the foregoing rules.
     Incentive Compensation Guidance. On June 21, 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC jointly issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies (the “Incentive Compensation Guidance”) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance sets expectations for banking organizations concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk-management, control and governance processes. The Incentive Compensation Guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon three primary principles: (i) balanced risk-taking incentives, (ii) compatibility with effective controls and risk management, and (iii) strong corporate governance. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. In addition, under the Incentive Compensation Guidance, a banking organization’s federal regulator may initiate enforcement action if the organization’s incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization.
     Broker-Dealer
     The Hilltop Broker-Dealers are broker-dealers registered with the SEC, FINRA, all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Hilltop Securities is also registered in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations, principally FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and national securities exchanges. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) for governing its members and the industry. Broker-dealers are also subject to federal securities laws and SEC rules, as well as the laws and rules of the states in which a broker-dealer conducts business. The Hilltop Broker-Dealers are members of, and are primarily subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by FINRA.

 
  22

 

     The regulations to which broker-dealers are subject cover all aspects of the securities business, including, but not limited to, sales and trade practices, net capital requirements, record keeping and reporting procedures, relationships and conflicts with customers, the handling of cash and margin accounts, experience and training requirements for certain employees, the conduct of investment banking and research activities and the conduct of registered persons, directors, officers and employees. Broker-dealers are also subject to the privacy and anti-money laundering laws and regulations discussed herein. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC, securities exchanges, or self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers. The SEC, securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations and states may conduct administrative and enforcement proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of broker-dealers, their registered persons, officers or employees. The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers and the securities markets rather than protection of creditors and stockholders of broker-dealers.
     Limitation on Businesses. The businesses that the Hilltop Broker-Dealers may conduct are limited by its agreements with, and its oversight by, FINRA, other regulatory authorities and federal and state law. Participation in new business lines, including trading of new products or participation on new exchanges or in new countries often requires governmental and/or exchange approvals, which may take significant time and resources. In addition, the Hilltop Broker-Dealers are operating subsidiaries of Hilltop, which means its activities are further limited by those that are permissible for subsidiaries of financial holding companies, and as a result, may be prevented from entering new businesses that may be profitable in a timely manner, if at all.
     Net Capital Requirements. The SEC, FINRA and various other regulatory authorities have stringent rules and regulations with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by regulated entities. Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act (the “Net Capital Rule”) requires that a broker-dealer maintain minimum net capital. Generally, a broker-dealer’s net capital is net worth plus qualified subordinated debt less deductions for non-allowable (or non-liquid) assets and other adjustments and operational charges. At December 31, 2018, the Hilltop Broker-Dealers were in compliance with applicable net capital requirements.
     The SEC, CFTC, FINRA and other regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined thresholds. These rules also dictate the ratio of debt-to-equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer, and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. If a broker-dealer fails to maintain the required net capital, it may be subject to penalties and other regulatory sanctions, including suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC or applicable regulatory authorities, and suspension or expulsion by these regulators could ultimately lead to the broker-dealer’s liquidation. Additionally, the Net Capital Rule and certain FINRA rules impose requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to, and approval from, the SEC and FINRA for certain capital withdrawals.
     Compliance with the net capital requirements may limit our operations, requiring the intensive use of capital. Such rules require that a certain percentage of our assets be maintained in relatively liquid form and therefore act to restrict our ability to withdraw capital from our broker-dealer entities, which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends, repay debt or redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding common stock. Any change in such rules or the imposition of new rules affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against capital, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, repay debt, meet our debt covenant requirements or to expand or maintain our operations. In addition, such rules may require us to make substantial capital contributions into one or more of the Hilltop Broker-Dealers in order for such subsidiaries to comply with such rules, either in the form of cash or subordinated loans made in accordance with the requirements of all applicable net capital rules.
     Customer Protection Rule.  The Hilltop Broker-Dealers that hold customers’ funds and securities are subject to the SEC’s customer protection rule (Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act), which generally provides that such broker-dealers maintain physical possession or control of all fully-paid securities and excess margin securities carried for the account of customers and maintain certain reserves of cash or qualified securities.
     Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”). The Hilltop Broker-Dealers are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act and belong to SIPC, whose primary function is to provide financial protection for the customers of failing 

 
  23

 
brokerage firms. SIPC provides protection for customers up to $500,000, of which a maximum of $250,000 may be in cash.
     Anti-Money Laundering. The Hilltop Broker-Dealers must also comply with the USA PATRIOT Act and other rules and regulations, including FINRA requirements, designed to fight international money laundering and to block terrorist access to the U.S. financial system. We are required to have systems and procedures to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations.
     CFTC Oversight. Hilltop Securities and HTS Independent Network are registered as introducing brokers with the CFTC and NFA. The CFTC also has net capital regulations (CFTC Rule 1.17) that must be satisfied. Our futures business is also regulated by the NFA, a registered futures association. Violation of the rules of the CFTC, the NFA or the commodity exchanges could result in remedial actions including fines, registration restrictions or terminations, trading prohibitions or revocations of commodity exchange memberships.
     Investment Advisory Activity. Hilltop Securities Asset Management, LLC, Hilltop Securities and HTS Independent Network are registered with, and subject to oversight and inspection by, the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The investment advisory business of our subsidiaries is subject to significant federal regulation, including with respect to wrap fee programs, the management of client accounts, the safeguarding of client assets, client fees and disclosures, transactions among affiliates and recordkeeping and reporting procedures. Legislation and changes in regulations promulgated by the SEC or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of investment advisers. The SEC may conduct administrative and enforcement proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension, revocation or expulsion of the investment advisory business of our subsidiaries, our officers or employees.
     Volcker Rule. Provisions of the Volcker Rule and the final rules implementing the Volcker Rule also restrict certain activities provided by the Hilltop Broker-Dealers, including proprietary trading and sponsoring or investing in “covered funds.” 
     Changing Regulatory Environment. The regulatory environment in which the Hilltop Broker-Dealers operate is subject to frequent change. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the U.S. Congress, the SEC, FINRA or other U.S. and state governmental and regulatory authorities. The business, financial condition and operating results of the Hilltop Broker-Dealers also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental and regulatory authorities. In the current era of heightened regulation of financial institutions, the Hilltop Broker-Dealers can expect to incur increasing compliance costs, along with the industry as a whole.
     Mortgage Origination
     PrimeLending and the Bank are subject to the rules and regulations of the CFPB, FHA, VA, FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage-backed securities. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts, and, with respect to VA loans, fix maximum interest rates. Mortgage origination activities are subject to, among others, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Secure and Fair Enforcement of Mortgage Licensing Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder which, among other things, prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to borrowers concerning credit terms and settlement costs. PrimeLending and the Bank are also subject to regulation by the Texas Department of Banking with respect to, among other things, the establishment of maximum origination fees on certain types of mortgage loan products. PrimeLending and the Bank are also subject to the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and provides mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to repay, restrictions on variable-rate lending, loan officers’ compensation, risk retention, and new disclosure requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also clarifies that applicable state laws, rules and regulations related to the origination, processing, selling and servicing of mortgage loans continue to apply to PrimeLending. 

 
  24

 

 The final rules concerning mortgage origination and servicing address the following topics:
     Ability to Repay.  This final rule implements the Dodd-Frank Act provisions requiring that for residential mortgages, creditors must make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. The final rule also establishes a presumption of compliance with the ability to repay determination for a certain category of mortgages called “qualified mortgages” meeting a series of detailed requirements. The final rule also provides a rebuttable presumption for higher-priced mortgage loans.
     High-Cost Mortgage.  This final rule strengthens consumer protections for high-cost mortgages (generally bans balloon payments and prepayment penalties, subject to exceptions and bans or limits certain fees and practices) and requires consumers to receive information about homeownership counseling prior to taking out a high-cost mortgage.
     Appraisals for High-Risk Mortgages.  The final rule permits a creditor to extend a higher-priced (subprime) mortgage loan (“HPML”) only if the following conditions are met (subject to exceptions):  (i) the creditor obtains a written appraisal; (ii) the appraisal is performed by a certified or licensed appraiser; and (iii) the appraiser conducts a physical property visit of the interior of the property. The rule also requires that during the application process, the applicant receives a notice regarding the appraisal process and their right to receive a free copy of the appraisal.
     Copies of Appraisals.  This final rule amends Regulation B that implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. It requires a creditor to provide a free copy of appraisal or valuation reports prepared in connection with any closed-end loan secured by a first lien on a dwelling. The final rule requires notice to applicants of the right to receive copies of any appraisal or valuation reports and creditors must send copies of the reports whether or not the loan transaction is consummated.  Creditors must provide the copies of the appraisal or evaluation reports for free, however, the creditors may charge reasonable fees for the cost of the appraisal or valuation unless applicable law provides otherwise.
     Escrow Requirements.  This final rule implements Dodd-Frank Act changes that generally extend the required duration of an escrow account on certain higher-priced mortgage loans from a minimum of one year to a minimum of five years, subject to certain exemptions for loans made by certain creditors that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas, as long as certain other criteria are met. This final rule became effective on June 1, 2013.
     Servicing.  Two final rules were published to implement laws to protect consumers from detrimental actions by mortgage servicers and to provide consumers with better tools and information when dealing with mortgage servicers. One final rule amends Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act, and a second final rule amends Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The rules cover nine major topics implementing the Dodd-Frank Act provisions related to mortgage servicing. The final rules include a number of exemptions and other adjustments for small servicers, defined as servicers that service 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans and service only mortgage loans that they or an affiliate originated or own.
     Mortgage Loan Originator Compensation.  This final rule implements Dodd-Frank Act requirements, as well as revises and clarifies existing regulations and commentary on loan originator compensation. The rule also prohibits, among other things: (i) certain arbitration agreements; (ii) financing certain credit insurance in connection with a mortgage loan; (iii) compensation based on a term of a transaction or a proxy for a term of a transaction; and (iv) dual compensation from a consumer and another person in connection with the transaction. The final rule also imposes a duty on individual loan officers, mortgage brokers and creditors to be “qualified” and, when applicable, registered or licensed to the extent required under applicable State and Federal law.
     Risk Retention. This final rule implements the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act that at least one sponsor of each securitization retains at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing asset-backed securities. Sponsors are prohibited from hedging or transferring this credit risk, and the rule applies in both public and private transactions. Securitizations backed by “qualified residential mortgages” or “servicing assets” are exempt from the rule, and the definition of “qualified residential mortgages” is subject to review of the joint regulators every five years. The rule became effective on December 24, 2015 with respect to asset-backed securities collateralized by residential mortgages and December 24, 2016 with respect to all other classes of asset-backed securities.
     Any additional regulatory requirements affecting our mortgage origination operations will result in increased compliance costs and may impact revenue.

     Insurance
     NLC’s insurance subsidiaries, NLIC and ASIC, are subject to regulation and supervision in each state where they are licensed to do business. This regulation and supervision is vested in state agencies having broad administrative power over the various aspects of the business of NLIC and ASIC.
     State insurance holding company regulation.  NLC controls two operating insurance companies, NLIC and ASIC, and is subject to the insurance holding company laws of Texas, the state in which those insurance companies are domiciled. These laws generally require NLC to register with the Texas Department of Insurance (“TDI”) and periodically to furnish financial and other information about the operations of companies within its holding company structure. Generally under these laws, all transactions between an insurer and an affiliated company in its holding company structure, including sales, loans, reinsurance agreements and service agreements, must be fair and reasonable and, if satisfying a specified threshold amount or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval or non-objection by the TDI.
     National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) is a group consisting of state insurance commissioners that discuss issues and formulate policy with respect to regulation, reporting and accounting for insurance companies. Although the NAIC has no legislative authority and insurance companies are at all times subject to the laws of their respective domiciliary states and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they conduct business, the NAIC is influential in determining the form in which such laws are enacted. Certain Model Insurance Laws, Regulations and Guidelines, or Model Laws, have been promulgated by the NAIC as a minimum standard by which state regulatory systems and regulations are measured. Adoption of state laws that provide for substantially similar regulations to those described in the Model Laws is a requirement for accreditation by the NAIC.
     The NAIC provides authoritative guidance to insurance regulators on current statutory accounting issues by promulgating and updating a codified set of statutory accounting practices in its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. The TDI has generally adopted these codified statutory accounting practices.
     Texas also has adopted laws substantially similar to the NAIC’s risk based capital (“RBC”) laws, which require insurers to maintain minimum levels of capital based on their investments and operations. Domestic property and casualty insurers are required to report their RBC based on a formula that attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in the insurer’s mix of products and investment portfolio. The formula is designed to allow the TDI to identify potential inadequately capitalized companies. Under the formula, a company determines its RBC by taking into account certain risks related to its assets (including risks related to its investment portfolio and ceded reinsurance) and its liabilities (including underwriting risks related to the nature and experience of its insurance business). Among other requirements, an insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least 200% of the RBC computed by the NAIC’s RBC model (known as the “Authorized Control Level” of RBC). At December 31, 2018, NLIC and ASIC capital and surplus levels exceeded the minimum RBC requirements that would trigger regulatory attention. In their 2018 statutory financial statements, both NLIC and ASIC complied with the NAIC’s RBC reporting requirements.
     The NAIC’s Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) was developed to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. IRIS identifies twelve industry ratios and specifies a range of “usual values” for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of these ratios can lead to inquiries from state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer’s business. For 2018, all ratios for both NLIC and ASIC were within the usual values with three exceptions. Both companies fell below the indicated minimum investment yield range of 2%, with NLIC at 1.6% and ASIC at 0.6%, due to the concentration in cash at each company and reductions in the fair value of equity investments in accordance with a recently adopted accounting standard related to accounting for financial instruments. We expect improvement in the yields at both companies as appropriate investment opportunities are identified. Both NLIC and ASIC also fell below the bottom of the gross change in policyholder surplus and change in adjusted policyholder surplus range of -10%, with NLIC at -16% and ASIC at -21%. This is a result of $24.5 million of aggregate dividends paid from NLIC and ASIC during 2018. Surplus levels remain within acceptable premium to surplus ranges. ASIC’s two-year overall operating ratio of 102% was higher than the indicated ratio of 100% due primarily to decreases in premiums earned and increases in loss and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) over the past two years.  
     Federal Office of Insurance.  The Dodd-Frank Act established within the Treasury Department a Federal Office of Insurance (“FIO”) and vested FIO with the authority to monitor all aspects of the insurance sector, monitor the extent to 

 
  26

 
which traditionally underserved communities and consumers have access to affordable non-health insurance products, and to represent the United States on prudential aspects of international insurance matters. Management is monitoring the activities of the FIO for any possible federal regulation of the insurance industry.
     Legislative changes.  From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been, or are, proposed that would adversely affect the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have been, or are being, considered are the possible introduction of Federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which proposals have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various Model Laws adopted by the NAIC. NLC is unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted, the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted, or the effect, if any, these developments would have on its financial condition or results of operations.
     The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 extended a Federal Program designed to ensure the availability of commercial insurance coverage for terrorist acts in the United States through December 31, 2020 and set the reimbursement percentage at 85%, subject to a decrease of one percentage point per calendar year until it equals 80%, and the deductible at 20%. Although NLC is protected by federally funded terrorism reinsurance, there is a substantial deductible that must be met, the payment of which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. NLC’s deductible under this Federal Program was $0.6 million for 2018 and is estimated to be $0.5 million in 2019. Potential future changes could also adversely affect NLC by causing its reinsurers to increase prices or withdraw from certain markets where terrorism coverage is required. NLC had no terrorism-related losses in 2018.
     State insurance regulations.  State insurance authorities have broad powers to regulate U.S. insurance companies. The primary purposes of these powers are to promote insurer solvency and to protect individual policyholders. The extent of regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative power to state insurance departments. These powers relate to, among other things, licensing to transact business, accreditation of reinsurers, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, regulating unfair trade and claims practices, establishing actuarial requirements and solvency standards, regulating investments and dividends, and regulating policy forms, related materials and premium rates. State insurance laws and regulations require insurance companies to file financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles prescribed by insurance departments in states in which they conduct insurance business, and their operations are subject to examination by those departments.
     As part of the broad authority that state insurance commissioners hold, they may impose periodic rules or regulations related to local issues or events. An example is the State of Oklahoma’s prohibition on the cancellation of policies for nonpayment of premium in the wake of severe tornadic activity during 2013. Due to the extent of damage and displacement of people, inability of mail to reach policyholders and inaccessibility of entire neighborhoods, the State of Oklahoma prohibited insurance companies from canceling or non-renewing policies for a period of time following the specific event.
     Periodic financial and market conduct examinations.  The insurance departments in every state in which NLC’s insurance companies do business may conduct on-site visits and examinations of its insurance companies at any time to review the insurance companies’ financial condition, market conduct and relationships and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the TDI will conduct comprehensive examinations of insurance companies domiciled in Texas every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other licensing states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC.
     In June 2017, the TDI delivered an examination report of NLIC and ASIC through December 31, 2015. This examination report contained no information of any significant compliance issues and there is no indication of any significant changes to our financial statements as a result of the examination by the domiciliary state. 
     State dividend limitations.  The TDI must approve any dividend declared or paid by an insurance company domiciled in the state if the dividend, together with all dividends declared or distributed by that insurance company during the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (1) 10% of its policyholders’ surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (2) 100% of its net income for the preceding calendar year. The greater number is known as the insurer’s extraordinary dividend limit. At December 31, 2018, the extraordinary dividend limit for NLIC and ASIC was $9.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively. In addition, NLC’s insurance companies may only pay dividends out of their earned surplus.

 Statutory accounting principles.  Statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) are a comprehensive basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP rules are different from GAAP, and are intended to reflect a more conservative view of the insurer. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s surplus to policyholders. Accordingly, SAP focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with insurance laws and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state.
     While GAAP is concerned with a company’s solvency, it also stresses other financial measurements, such as income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenues and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as opposed to SAP. SAP, as established by the NAIC and adopted by Texas regulators, determines the statutory surplus and statutory net income of the NLC insurance companies and, thus, determines the amount they have available to pay dividends.
     Guaranty associations.  In Texas, and in all of the jurisdictions in which NLIC and ASIC are, or in the future may be, licensed to transact business, there is a requirement that property and casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction must participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay limited covered benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer was engaged. States generally permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.
     NLC did not incur any levies from guaranty associations in 2018, 2017 or 2016. Property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may, however, result in additional guaranty fund assessments at some future date. At this time NLC is unable to determine the impact, if any, that these assessments may have on its financial condition or results of operations. NLC has established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
     National Flood Insurance Program.  NLC’s insurance subsidiary, NLIC, has entered into a production agreement with Wright National Flood Insurance Services, LLC (“Wright Flood Services”), a managing general underwriter and agency, that services flood insurance programs, including but not limited to Write Your Own flood insurance in the National Flood Insurance Program administered by the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration on behalf of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. NLIC produces and submits flood insurance business with Wright Flood Services.
     Participation in involuntary risk plans.  NLC’s insurance companies are required to participate in residual market or involuntary risk plans in various states where they are licensed that provide insurance to individuals or entities that otherwise would be unable to purchase coverage from private insurers. If these plans experience losses in excess of their capitalization, they may assess participating insurers for proportionate shares of their financial deficit. These plans include the Georgia Underwriting Association, Texas FAIR Plan Association, Texas Windstorm Insurance Agency, the Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, the Mississippi Residential Property Insurance Underwriting Association and the Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting Association. To address a 2016 deficit and losses resulting from Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the Texas FAIR Plan Association levied an assessment on participating companies totaling $55.0 million, of which NLC’s insurance subsidiaries’ share was $0.6 million. In addition, the Texas Windstorm Insurance Agency levied an assessment on participating companies totaling $175.0 million, of which NLC’s insurance subsidiaries’ share was $1.6 million. For comparative purposes, in 2005, following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, NLC’s insurance subsidiaries were levied collective assessments by the above plans totaling $10.4 million. Additional assessments, including emergency assessments, may follow. In some of these instances, NLC’s insurance companies should be able to recover these assessments through policyholder surcharges, higher rates or reinsurance. The ultimate impact hurricanes have on state facilities is currently uncertain and future assessments can occur whenever the involuntary facilities experience financial deficits.
     Other.  Insurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission.
     Changes in any of the laws governing our conduct could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business or could materially affect our financial position, operating income, expense or cash flow.
