---------+----------

Our Company 
 Vantage Drilling International, a Cayman Islands exempted company, is an international offshore drilling company focused on operating a fleet of modern, high specification drilling units. Our principal business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and work crews, primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells for our customers. Through our fleet of drilling units, we are a provider of offshore contract drilling services to major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies, focused on international markets. Additionally, for drilling units owned by others, we provide construction supervision services for rigs that are under construction, preservation management services for rigs that are stacked and operations and marketing services for operating rigs.
Our Fleet  
 Jackups 
 A jackup rig is a mobile, self-elevating drilling platform equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established for support, at which point the hull is raised out of the water into position to conduct drilling and workover operations. All of our premium jackup rigs were built at PPL Shipyard in Singapore. The design of our premium jackup rigs is the Baker Marine Pacific Class 375. These units are ultra-premium jackup rigs with independent legs capable of drilling in up to 375 feet of water, a cantilever drilling floor and a total drilling depth capacity of approximately 30,000 feet. 
Drillships 
 Drillships are self-propelled and suited for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load carrying capacity. While all of our drillships are dynamically positioned and designed for drilling in water depths of up to 12,000 feet, with a total vertical drilling depth capacity of up to 40,000 feet, the Platinum Explorer, Titanium Explorer and Tungsten Explorer are currently equipped to drill in 10,000 feet of water. The drillships’ hull design has a variable deck load of approximately 20,000 tons and measures approximately 781 feet long by 137 feet wide. All of our drillships were built at Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea. 
 The following table sets forth certain information concerning our offshore drilling fleet as of February 28, 2019.

Reorganization
 Restructuring Agreement and Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceeding
 On December 1, 2015, we and Vantage Drilling Company (“VDC”), our former parent company, entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Restructuring Agreement”) with a majority of our secured creditors. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, the Company agreed to pursue a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the “Reorganization Plan”) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and VDC agreed to commence official liquidation proceedings under the laws of the Cayman Islands. On December 2, 2015, pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, the Company acquired two subsidiaries responsible for the management of the Company from VDC in exchange for a $61.5 million promissory note (the “VDC Note”). As this transaction involved a reorganization of entities under common control, it was reflected in the consolidated financial statements, at carryover basis, on a retrospective basis. Effective as of the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy on February 10, 2016 (the 
 3

“Effective Date”), VDC’s former equity interest in the Company was cancelled. Immediately following that event, the VDC Note was converted into 655,094 new ordinary shares of the reorganized Company (the “New Shares”) in accordance with the terms thereof, in satisfaction of the obligation thereunder, which, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $62.6 million as of such date.
 On December 3, 2015 (the “Petition Date”), the Company, certain of its subsidiaries and certain VDC subsidiaries that were guarantors of the Company’s pre-bankruptcy secured debt, filed the Reorganization Plan in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (In re Vantage Drilling International (F/K/A Offshore Group Investment Limited), et al., Case No. 15-12422). On January 15, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the Company’s pre-packaged Reorganization Plan and the Company emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Reorganization Plan, the pre-bankruptcy term loans and senior notes were retired on the Effective Date by issuing to the debtholders 4,344,959 units in the reorganized Company (the “Units”). Each Unit of securities originally consisted of one New Share and $172.61 of principal of the Company’s 1%/12% Step-Up Senior Secured Third Lien Convertible Notes due 2030 (the “Convertible Notes”), subject to adjustment upon the payment of interest in kind (“PIK interest”) and certain cases of redemption or conversion of the Convertible Notes, as well as share splits, share dividends, consolidation or reclassification of the New Shares. The New Shares and the Convertible Notes are subject to the terms of an agreement that prohibits the New Shares and Convertible Notes from being traded separately.
 The Convertible Notes are convertible into New Shares in certain circumstances, at a conversion price (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Indenture for the Convertible Notes), which was $95.60 as of the issue date. The Indenture for the Convertible Notes contains customary covenants that restrict the granting of liens and customary events of default, including among other things, failure to issue securities upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2018, after taking into account the payment of PIK interest on the Convertible Notes to such date, each such Unit consisted of one New Share and $177.66 of principal of Convertible Notes.
 Other significant elements of the Reorganization Plan included:
 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company’s pre-petition credit agreement was amended and restated (the “Credit Agreement”) to (i) replace the $32.0 million revolving letter of credit commitment under its pre-petition facility with a new $32.0 million revolving letter of credit facility and (ii) repay the $150.0 million of outstanding borrowings with (a) $7.0 million of cash and (b) the issuance of $143.0 million initial term loans (the “2016 Term Loan Facility”). In November 2018, all obligations under the 2016 Term Loan Facility were repaid and the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the Credit Agreement were terminated in connection with the issuance of the 9.25% First Lien Notes (as defined below). See “Recent Developments—Refinancing”.
 10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. Holders of the Company’s pre-petition term loans and senior notes claims were eligible to participate in a rights offering conducted by the Company for $75.0 million of the Company’s new 10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2020 (the “10% Second Lien Notes”). In connection with this rights offering, certain creditors entered into a “backstop” agreement to purchase 10% Second Lien Notes if the offer was not fully subscribed. The premium paid to such creditors under the backstop agreement was approximately $2.2 million, which was paid $1.1 million in cash and $1.1 million in additional 10% Second Lien Notes, resulting in a total issued amount of $76.1 million of 10% Second Lien Notes and net cash proceeds to the Company of $73.9 million, after deducting the cash portion of the backstop premium. In November 2018, all of the 10% Second Lien Notes were redeemed in connection with the issuance of the 9.25% First Lien Notes (as defined below). See “Recent Developments—Refinancing”.
 The Reorganization Plan allowed the Company to continue business operations during the court proceedings and maintain all operating assets and agreements. The Company had adequate liquidity prior to the filing and did not have to seek any debtor-in-possession financing. All trade payables, credits, wages and other related obligations were unimpaired by the Reorganization Plan.
 Recent Developments
 Refinancing
 On November 30, 2018, we issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.25% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due November 15, 2023 (“9.25% First Lien Notes”) in a private placement at par. The proceeds of the issuance were used (i) to repay all obligations under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and to terminate the Credit Agreement, (ii) to redeem all outstanding 10% Second Lien Notes, (iii) to fund the remaining amounts to be paid in connection with the Rig Purchase (as defined below), (iv) to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing and to the offering of the 9.25% First Lien Notes and (v) for general corporate purposes. The 9.25% First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The 9.25% First Lien Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws.
 Concurrently with the issuance of the 9.25% First Lien Notes, we entered into a new letter of credit facility to replace the letter of credit facility existing under the Credit Agreement. The new facility has a capacity of $50.0 million, with all outstanding letters of credit being cash collateralized. As of December 31, 2018, we had $36.3 million available for the issuance of letters of credit under this cash collateralized letter of credit facility.

Rig Purchase
 On June 13, 2018, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Ship Finance International Limited to acquire the shares of Rig Finance Limited, an entity that owns the Soehanah jackup rig, a Baker Marine Pacific Class 375 jackup rig, and related bareboat charter to which Rig Finance Limited is a party, for $84.6 million, subject to certain adjustments for working capital and liabilities of the entity not discharged by the acquisition date (the “Rig Purchase”). We made a down payment of $15.0 million in connection with the execution of the share purchase agreement, and the remaining $69.6 million was paid at closing on December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the bareboat charter currently in place with respect to the Soehanah jackup rig, the entity to which the rig is chartered has the right to acquire the rig at the end of the term of the bareboat charter for $100.0 million (or more depending on the rig’s valuation). 
Subsequent Events
 On March 1, 2019, VAALCO Gabon S.A. awarded us a 120 day contract for our premium jack-up, the Topaz Driller, to perform drilling services in Gabon.
 On March 5, 2019, Dana Gas Egypt Limited (“Dana Gas”) awarded a drilling contract to Advanced Energy Systems (ADES) S.A.E. (“ADES”) in respect of our ultra-deepwater drillship, the Tungsten Explorer, to provide drilling services offshore of Egypt.    On March 13, 2019, ADES assigned its rights and obligations under the drilling contract to ADVantage Drilling Services S.A.E, a joint venture between a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and a wholly owned subsidiary of ADES.  The term of the contract is for one well, with operations estimated to last 77 days, and the client has the right to extend the term by up to three additional wells.
Drilling Contract Arbitration
 On August 31, 2015, Petrobras America, Inc. (“PAI”) and Petrobras Venezuela Investments & Services, BV (“PVIS”), both subsidiaries of Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), notified the Company of the termination of the Agreement for the Provision of Drilling Services for the Titanium Explorer dated February 4, 2009 (the “Drilling Contract”) between PVIS and Vantage Deepwater Company, which had been novated to PAI and Vantage Deepwater Drilling, Inc., claiming the Company had breached its obligations under the Drilling Contract. Vantage Deepwater Company and Vantage Deepwater Drilling, Inc. are both wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. We immediately filed an international arbitration claim against PAI, PVIS and Petrobras, claiming wrongful termination of the Drilling Contract.
 On July 2, 2018, an international arbitration tribunal issued an award in favor of Vantage Deepwater Company and Vantage Deepwater Drilling, Inc. The tribunal found that PAI and PVIS breached the Drilling Contract, and awarded Vantage Deepwater Company and Vantage Deepwater Drilling, Inc. damages in the aggregate amount of $622.0 million against PAI, PVIS and Petrobras, and dismissed the Petrobras parties’ counterclaims against the Company with prejudice. The tribunal also awarded the Company interest on the foregoing award amount at an annual rate of 15.2%, compounded monthly, to accrue from (i) April 1, 2018, with respect to $615.6 million thereof, (ii) October 20, 2015, with respect to $5.2 million thereof, and (iii) November 19, 2015, with respect to $1.2 million thereof, in each case, until final payment of the awarded sums. In accordance with the terms of the award, each of the Company and Petrobras will bear its own legal fees, and the fees and expenses of the tribunal, including the compensation of the arbitrators, aggregating approximately $1.5 million, will be borne equally by both sides. Pursuant to the terms of the award, the amount due to the Company as of December 31, 2018, totaled approximately $701.4 million, inclusive of interest.
 On July 2, 2018, our subsidiaries, Vantage Deepwater Company and Vantage Deepwater Drilling, Inc., filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas to confirm the arbitration award against the Petrobras parties. On August 31, 2018, Petrobras, PAI and PVIS filed with the court, among other things, a response to our petition and a motion to vacate the arbitration award. The court heard our petition and their response and motion to vacate on March 8, 2019.  
 In connection with enforcing the arbitration award against the Petrobras parties, we secured an order from the Amsterdam District Court in the Netherlands on August 22, 2018, which froze certain assets of Petrobras and PVIS in the Netherlands that we believe are valued in excess of our claim at this time. On November 15, 2018, we filed a petition in the Court of Appeals in The Hague, the Netherlands, to recognize and enforce the arbitration award against the Petrobras parties in the Netherlands.  On March 1, 2019, the Petrobras parties filed their statement of defense with the court.  The court is scheduled to hear our petition and the Petrobras parties’ statement of defense on May 14, 2019.  
 The Company’s ability to fully recover the award against the Petrobras parties is subject to legal, procedural, solvency and other risks associated with enforcing arbitration awards in these circumstances. In addition, any award ultimately recovered will be subject to reduction in respect of legal fees owed (including, among others, fees contingent on the size of the award, less amounts previously paid) and any applicable taxes. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to whether, or to what extent, such award will ultimately be recovered, if at all. 
 Brazil Improbity Action
 On April 27, 2018, the Company was added as an additional defendant in a legal proceeding initiated by the Brazilian federal public prosecutor’s office in the State of Parana, Brazil (the “Brazilian Federal Prosecutor”) against certain individuals, including an executive of Petrobras and two political lobbyists, in connection with the contracting of the Titanium Explorer drillship to Petrobras under the Drilling Contract, with the Brazilian Government and Petrobras as plaintiffs. Vantage is alleged to have been involved in and benefitted from the purported bribery scheme at Petrobras through Hamylton Padilha, the Brazilian agent our former parent 
 5

company, VDC, used in the contracting of the Titanium Explorer drillship to Petrobras, and Mr. Hsin-Chi Su, a former member of the Board of Directors and a significant shareholder of VDC. We first became aware of the legal proceeding on July 19, 2018 as it was previously under seal. The Company has not been formally served nor advised by any Brazilian authorities of any particular charges. The Company understands that the legal proceeding, which is called an improbity action, is a civil action and is part of the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor’s larger “Car Wash” investigation into money laundering and corruption allegations at Petrobras.             
 The damages claimed in the proceeding are in the amount of BRL 102.8 million (approximately $31.0 million), together with a civil fine equal to three times that amount. The Company understands that the Brazilian court hearing the proceeding has issued an order authorizing the seizure and freezing of the assets of the Company and the other three defendants in the legal proceeding, as a precautionary measure, in the amount of approximately $124.0 million. The Company and the other three defendants are jointly and severally liable for this amount. The seizure order has not had an effect on the Company’s assets or operations. The Company does not own any assets in Brazil, and does not currently intend to relocate any assets to Brazil. 
 On February 13, 2019, we learned that the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor has requested mutual legal assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to the United Nations Convention against Corruption of 2003 to obtain a freezing order against the Company’s U.S. assets in the amount of $124.0 million. The Company believes this request is not supported by applicable law and intends to vigorously oppose and defend against any attempts to seize its assets. Further, the Company intends to vigorously defend against the allegations made in the underlying improbity action.  However, we can neither predict the ultimate outcome of this matter nor that there will not be further developments in the “Car Wash” investigation or in any other ongoing investigation or related proceeding that could adversely affect us.
 Strengths 
 We believe our primary competitive strengths include the following: 
 We own and operate a diversified, premium fleet. We have a diversified fleet of eight high-specification drilling units that is capable of providing premium drilling services for both shallow water and deepwater applications. We recognize that shallow water and deepwater business cycles may differ, particularly during an industry recovery, and believe our fleet diversity reduces our reliance on any particular market segment. Our fleet currently includes five jackup rigs and three drillships. 

• | Jackup rigs. We believe that our ultra-premium jackup rigs compare favorably to the majority of the current global jackup rig fleet, which is primarily comprised of rigs that are older, smaller and less capable due to their reliance on, and utilization of, less modern equipment. Each of our jackup rigs is less than 11 years old and has a water depth capability of 375 feet and drilling depth capability of 30,000 feet. Our jackup rigs are equipped with offline stand-building systems, which provide significant drilling efficiency and have at least a 1.5 million pound hook load, allowing more demanding wells to be drilled. Each of our jackup rigs have (i) a cantilever reach envelop of 75 x 30 feet, which enables each rig to reach more well slots on a platform without requiring a rig move, (ii) a large deck space, (iii) 3,749 tons of variable deck-load, allowing more equipment and supplies to be stored on the rig, and (iv) a 120-person accommodation, all of which we believe bring efficiencies, better logistics and significant cost savings to our customers. As a result, we believe our jackups are generally preferred by clients for their superior and more efficient drilling performance, better and more cost-effective logistics, and consistent activity levels. As demonstrated during the current cycle, clients have shown a preference for modern jackups, such as ours, with global modern jackup utilization rebounding more rapidly than older rigs. As of February 28, 2019, our jackup rigs are 100% utilized.

• | Drillships. Our ultra-deepwater drillships are designed to drill in up to 12,000 feet of water, and two of our drillships have been further upgraded with a hook load of 2.5 million pounds, which further enhances their ability to drill deep, complex and demanding wells. Our drillships are currently equipped with risers to drill in water depths of up to 10,000 feet, which we believe is the optimal specification for the majority of current ultra-deepwater development projects. However, additional risers could be added to drill in water depths of up to 12,000 feet as needed by our clients. Finally, a Managed Pressure Drilling (an “MPD”) system is currently being installed on the Tungsten Explorer drillship, and we have the ability to use this MPD on our other drillships. Based on our experience, a significant number of the recent and active requirements for floaters are requesting an MPD system (or a subset of an MPD system called Riser Gas Handling). We believe these high-specification and upgraded drillships are generally preferred by our clients and will better position us to secure contracts and command premium dayrates as compared to our competitors with less advanced fleets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our focus on increased efficiency has led to an optimized cost structure. Following the commodity price downturn in 2014, we implemented company-wide cost savings initiatives in an effort to reduce our rig operating expenses and general and administrative expenses through the right-sizing of shore-based teams and centralization of shore-based operational support in Dubai near key areas of operation. Further, we have significantly reduced our rig operating cost through nationalization and regionalization of senior offshore positions and active supply chain management. We believe our optimized cost structure is among the best in the industry and provides us with the flexibility to operate across business cycles and will lead to enhanced profitability in the event of a recovery in the offshore drilling industry. 
 We have a strong balance sheet with significant debt coverage. As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $239.4 million of cash on our balance sheet (including $14.4 million of restricted cash) and no near-term debt maturities. Our long-
 6

term debt consists of $350.0 million of 9.25% First Lien Notes, which are secured on a first priority basis by substantially all of our assets, as well as the Convertible Notes. In addition, in connection with our arbitration with Petrobras and related entities, we were awarded damages in the aggregate amount of $622.0 million, which accrues interest at an annual rate of 15.2%, although no assurances can be given as to whether, or to what extent, such award will ultimately be recovered, if at all.

We are a leading operator with strong client relationships. We believe that our safety and operational performance, experienced and skilled employees, and modern and highly advanced fleet have produced a track record of high-quality client service and operational safety, efficiency and effectiveness. We have received special recognition from several of our clients for superior drilling services based on key operational metrics, including with respect to drilling efficiency, low non-productive time, safe operations and best contractor performance. 
 We have a proven management team. Our executive team has a strong reputation for sound execution, customer focus and delivering strong financial performance. Our management team has extensive experience in the oilfield services and offshore drilling industries, as well as experience operating in key global offshore development locations, including the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia and India, with major international and national oil companies as well as independent exploration and production companies. In addition to the members of the management team, we have highly trained personnel operating and maintaining our rigs. We believe that our team’s significant experience, technical expertise and strong client relationships, as well as the functional depth throughout our organization, enhance our ability to deliver superior drilling service to our clients and effectively operate on a global basis. 
 Strategy 
 Our principal business objective is to be the preferred provider of premium offshore drilling rig services to the oil and gas industry. Our operating strategy is designed to enable us to provide high-quality, safe and cost-competitive services through the current business cycle, positioning us to benefit from an expected increase in demand for offshore drilling and to increase our cash flow and profits. Specifically, we expect to achieve our business objectives through the following strategies: 
 Enhanced focus on safety and operational excellence. With current decreased demand for offshore drilling services, excelling in safety and operational ability is a key factor for success. We intend to continue our focus on minimizing safety incidents, while also continually increasing our operational uptime and efficiency. This dual focus is intended to enable us to develop and maintain long-term customer relationships and maximize the utilization of our fleet while also ensuring the safety of our and our customers’ employees and contractors. We intend to maintain our exemplary safety and operational performance through attentive and engaged leadership, ongoing competency and training programs, appropriate incentive structures at all levels and effective management oversight. 
 Efficiently manage costs to adapt to and withstand a range of market conditions. With a cost-competitive fleet, we believe we are well-positioned to operate across business cycles and achieve enhanced profitability in the event of a recovery in the offshore drilling industry. We have assembled and deployed an active fleet that we believe is at the low end of the cost-of-supply curve through right sizing and centralization of shore-based support, nationalization and regionalization of senior offshore positions, and active supply chain management. We believe these efforts to manage costs will enable us to maintain our industry-leading fleet utilization while generating positive operational cash flows in the current low dayrate environment. 
 Maintain high fleet utilization and consistent activity levels to capitalize on customer preferences for active rigs. We enjoy an industry-leading fleet utilization, which serves as a competitive advantage in securing contracts given operators’ strong preference for rigs with consistent activity levels. Consistent activity helps reduce the uncertainty of any associated costs and preparation time for rigs to undertake new contracts. All of our jackup rigs are currently contracted with client options to extend their contracts. One of our drillships is currently contracted, one drillship is having its special periodic survey performed in advance of returning to work, and one drillship is maintained warm-stacked in anticipation of what we believe to be an improved dayrate and contract term environment commencing as early as 2020. 
 Preserve balance sheet and maintain significant liquidity through business cycles. With approximately $239.4 million cash on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 (including $14.4 million of restricted cash) and no near-term debt maturities, we continue to focus on preservation of liquidity as the offshore drilling business cycle continues. Additionally, the award we obtained in connection with our arbitration with Petrobras and related entities provides potential future upside and financial cushion in our capital structure. 
 Maintain high-quality asset portfolio with diverse footprint by selectively pursuing acquisitions that we believe align with our operational model and are likely to increase cash flow. Our balanced fleet of jackup rigs and drillships allows us to address the dynamic opportunity set in the offshore drilling industry. We believe the quality of our jackup rig and drillship fleets, combined with our experience in shallow and deepwater markets, position us to compete in various market segments and geographies. We maintain a young fleet with an average age of approximately eight years; accordingly, our high-specification assets enable us to capitalize on the bifurcation in utilization levels between modern and older rigs, and to secure contracts with premium dayrates. Additionally, high-
 7

specification modern drilling units generally provide superior and more efficient drilling performance, as well as enhanced and more cost effective logistics. Newer and more modern drilling units are also generally preferred by crews, which makes it easier to hire and retain high-quality operating personnel. As a result, our fleet is well suited to meet the requirements of customers for efficiently drilling complex wells in demanding locations. To maintain our high-quality asset portfolio, we are focused on disciplined investment in, and the growth of, our active drilling fleet to maximize our profitability. We believe the most attractive returns on invested capital are in opportunistic acquisitions of rigs that are complementary to our fleet, and that rigs of this type are currently available at historically low acquisition prices due to the offshore industry downturn. Additionally, we have invested in MPD technology for the Tungsten Explorer ultra-deepwater drillship, technology which is currently required by a significant number of the tenders in the market and is becoming increasingly prevalent in the industry, making such drillship highly regarded and sought after by customers. We have the ability to use this MPD system on our other drillships.
 Our Industry 
 The offshore contract drilling industry provides drilling, workover and well construction services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies through the use of mobile offshore drilling units. Historically, the offshore drilling industry has been very cyclical with periods of high demand, limited rig supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in some rigs becoming idle for long periods of time as is the case today. As is common throughout the oilfield services industry, offshore drilling is largely driven by actual or anticipated changes in oil and natural gas prices and capital spending by companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas. Sustained high commodity prices historically have led to increases in expenditures for offshore drilling activities and, as a result, greater demand for our services. As a result of the persistence of reduced oil and gas prices since late 2014, reduced demand for offshore drilling rigs by our customers has continued. The reduced demand is occurring at the same time that drilling rigs continue to be brought into the market or scheduled for delivery resulting in an oversupply of equipment. We expect that these adverse market conditions are likely to continue for the duration of 2019 and potentially beyond.  
 Offshore drilling rigs are generally marketed on a worldwide basis as rigs can be moved from one region to another. The cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary between regions. However, significant variations between regions do not tend to exist long-term because of rig mobility. 
 The offshore drilling market generally consists of shallow water (<400 ft.), midwater (>400 ft.), deepwater (>4,000 ft.) and ultra-deepwater (>7,500 ft.). The global shallow water market is serviced primarily by jackups. 
 Our jackup fleet is focused on the “long-legged” (>350 ft.) high specification market. The drillships that we operate are focused primarily on the ultra-deepwater segment, but can also operate efficiently and cost effectively in the midwater and deepwater markets. 
 Customers 
 Our customers are primarily large multinational oil and natural gas companies, government owned oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas producers. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the periods from January 1, 2016 to February 10, 2016 and from February 10, 2016 to December 31, 2016, the following customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue, in the respective periods:

Drilling Contracts 
 Our drilling contracts are the result of negotiation with our customers, and most contracts are awarded through competitive bidding against other contractors. Drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with higher rates while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control. Currently all of our drilling 
 8

contracts are on a dayrate basis. A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well (or group of wells) or covering a stated term. Certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination fee. Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non-performance, in the event of extensive downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events or for convenience by the customer. Many of these events are beyond our control. The contract term in some instances may be extended by the client exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term. Our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the client to extend the contract to finish drilling a well-in-progress. During periods of depressed market conditions, our clients may seek to renegotiate drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts. Suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension. To the extent (i) our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, (ii) our contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or (iii) a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 The following table sets forth certain information concerning the current contract status of our offshore drilling fleet as of February 28, 2019.

Contract Backlog 
 As of December 31, 2018, our owned fleet had total drilling contract backlog of approximately $156.7 million. We expect that approximately $108.9 million of our total contract backlog will be performed during 2019, with the remainder performed in subsequent years.
Competition 
 The contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Demand for contract drilling and related services is influenced by a number of factors, including the current and expected prices of oil and natural gas and the expenditures of oil and natural gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas. In addition, demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond our control, including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and pricing, the level of production of non-OPEC countries and the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves. 
 Drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis. Pricing (day rate) is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Rig availability, capabilities, age and each contractor’s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination. Operators also may consider crew experience, rig location and efficiency. We believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Certain competitors may have greater financial resources than we do, which may better enable them to withstand periods of low utilization, compete more effectively in a low price environment, build new rigs or acquire existing rigs. In the current market, contractors that are awarded a job are more often the ones that submit proposals for contracts at very low day rates thereby depressing global pricing.
 Our competition ranges from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller, locally owned companies. Competition for rigs is usually on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, although at a cost that is sometimes substantial, from one region to another in response to demand.

Operating Hazards 
 Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the offshore drilling business, including, but not limited to: blowouts, craterings, fires, explosions, equipment failures, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. 
 These hazards could cause personal injury or death, serious damage to or destruction of property and equipment, suspension of drilling operations, or damage to the environment, including damage to producing formations and surrounding areas. Generally, we seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our customers for some of these risks. To the extent not transferred to customers by contract, we seek protection against some of these risks through insurance, including property casualty insurance on our rigs and drilling equipment, protection and indemnity, commercial general liability, which has coverage extension for underground resources and equipment coverage, commercial contract indemnity and commercial umbrella insurance. 
 There are risks that are outside of our control. Nonetheless, we believe that we are adequately insured for liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against liability for all consequences of well disasters, extensive fire damage or damage to the environment. For more information regarding the risks related to our insurance policies, see “Risk Factors—Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and contractual indemnity rights may not be adequate to cover our losses”. 
 Insurance 
 We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage, third party liability, employer’s liability, war risk, general liability, vessel pollution and other coverage. However, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. 
 Our primary marine package provides for hull and machinery coverage for our drilling units up to a scheduled value for each asset, which we believe approximates replacement cost. The maximum coverage for our eight drilling units is $1.5 billion. The policies are subject to certain exclusions, limitations, deductibles and other conditions. Deductibles for physical damage to our jackup rigs and our drillships are $2.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, per occurrence. Our protection and indemnity policy provides liability coverage limits of $500.0 million per rig. In addition to these policies, we have separate policies providing coverage for onshore general liability, employer’s liability, auto liability and non-owned aircraft liability, with customary coverage, limits and deductibles. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 Our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to, and affected in varying degrees by, governmental laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws, regulations and duties relating to the importation and exportation of and operation of drilling units and other equipment, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and natural gas exploration and development, environmental protection, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel and the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so. Furthermore, these regulations have limited the opportunities for international drilling contractors to participate in tenders for contracts or to perform services in certain countries as the governments have strongly favored local service providers. Operations in less developed countries may be subject to legal systems that are not as predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings. 
 The shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations. Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities. Shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime.
 Environmental Regulation 
 For a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation on our current operations, see “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages”. We anticipate that we will continue to make expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. To date, we have not expended material amounts beyond those amounts spent on our basic rig designs in 
 10

order to comply and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or competitive position or materially increase our capital expenditures. 
 We have historically conducted work in the Gulf of Mexico and may conduct such work in the future. Although we are not currently conducting any operations under the jurisdiction of U.S. environmental and natural resource agencies, similar restrictions and concerns apply in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate. These requirements and concerns may be more or less stringent than those associated with the following U.S. laws.
 Heightened environmental concerns have led to greater and more stringent environmental regulations, higher drilling costs, and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process in many jurisdictions throughout the world. Requirements applicable to our operations include regulations that would require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or governmental approvals, control the discharge of materials into the environment, require removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment, or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Some of these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these requirements or the adoption of new or more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Environmental requirements include water quality laws, regulations and policies that prohibit and/or regulate the discharge of pollutants, including petroleum, into the waters. Certain facilities that store or otherwise handle oil are required to prepare and implement Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans and Facility Response Plans relating to the possible discharge of oil to surface waters. Violations of monitoring, reporting, permitting and other requirements can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Laws governing air emissions and solid and hazardous waste also apply to our operations.
 A variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security have been adopted in certain jurisdictions where we operate. For example, these initiatives may require the development of vessel security plans and on-board installation of automatic information systems, or AIS, to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications. 
 The International Maritime Organization (the “IMO”), a specialized agency of the United Nations, is responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. Among the various international conventions negotiated by the IMO is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). MARPOL imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and air emissions. 
 Annex VI to MARPOL (“Annex IV”) sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances. Annex VI also imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for specialized areas to be established internationally with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling units, Annex VI imposes various survey and certification requirements. For this purpose, gross tonnage is based on the International Tonnage Certificate for the vessel. The United States has ratified Annex VI. In addition, any drilling units we operate internationally are subject to the requirements of Annex VI in those countries that have implemented its provisions. We believe the drilling units we currently offer for international projects comply with Annex VI, but changes to our equipment and ratifying countries’ regulatory interpretations of the Annex VI requirements could impose additional costs on us, which could be significant. 
 Although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with these governmental laws and regulations, such compliance has not materially adversely affected our earnings or competitive position. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with the environmental regulations to which we are subject. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, we managed a workforce of approximately 894 people, of which approximately 400 were our direct employees.
