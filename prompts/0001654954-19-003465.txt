  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  General Information
  
 Noble Roman’s, Inc., an Indiana corporation incorporated in 1972, sells and services franchises and licenses and operates Company-owned foodservice locations for non-traditional foodservice operations and stand-alone restaurants under the trade names “Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub,” “Noble Roman’s Pizza,” “Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake,” and “Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs.” References in this report to the “Company” are to Noble Roman’s, Inc. and its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Pizzaco, Inc. and RH Roanoke, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise. RH Roanoke, Inc. operates a Company-owned non-traditional location.
  
 The Company has been operating, franchising and licensing Noble Roman’s Pizza operations in a variety of stand-alone and non-traditional locations across the country since 1972. Its first Craft Pizza & Pub location opened in January of 2017 as a Company-operated restaurant in a northern suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. Since then, three more Company-operated units have opened with an additional four locations being considered. The Company-operated locations serve as the base for what it sees as the potential primary growth driver in the near future, franchising to experienced, multi-unit restaurant operators with a track record of success. The Company has signed the first such operator, Indiana’s largest Dairy Queen franchisee with 19 franchised locations across north central Indiana. This franchisee’s first Craft Pizza & Pub location is under construction in Lafayette, Indiana with an opening anticipated for spring of 2019.
  
  Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub
  
 The Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub utilizes many of the basic elements first introduced in 1972 but in a modern atmosphere with up-to-date technology and equipment to maximize speed, enhance quality and perpetuate the taste customers love and expect from a Noble Roman’s.
  
 The Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub provides for a selection of 40 different toppings, cheeses and sauces from which to choose. Beer and wine also are featured, with 16 different beers on tap including both national and local craft selections. Wines include 16 affordably priced options by the bottle or glass in a range of varietals. Beer and wine service is provided at the bar and throughout the dining room.
  
 The Company designed the system to enable fast cook times, with oven speeds running approximately 2.5 minutes for traditional pizzas and 5.75 minutes for Sicilian pizzas. Traditional pizza favorites such as pepperoni are options on the menu, but also offered is a selection of Craft Pizza & Pub original pizza creations. The menu also features a selection of contemporary and fresh, made-to-order salads and fresh-cooked pasta. The menu also incorporates the same baked subs, hand-sauced wings and a selection of desserts, as well as Noble Roman’s famous Breadsticks with Spicy Cheese Sauce most of which has been offered in all its locations since 1972.
  
 Additional enhancements include a glass enclosed “Dough Room” where Noble Roman’s Dough Masters hand make all pizza and breadstick dough from scratch in customer view. Also in the dining room is a “Dusting & Drizzle Station” where guests can customize their pizzas after they are baked with a variety of toppings and drizzles, such as rosemary-infused olive oil, honey and Italian spices. Kids and adults enjoy Noble Roman’s self-serve root beer tap, which is also part of a special menu for customers 12 and younger. Throughout the dining room and the bar area there are many giant screen television monitors for sports and the nostalgic black and white shorts featured in Noble Roman’s since 1972.
  
 The Company designed its new curbside service for carry-out customers, called “Pizza Valet Service,” to create added value and convenience. With Pizza Valet Service, customers place orders ahead, drive into the restaurant’s reserved valet parking spaces and have their pizza run to their vehicle by specially uniformed pizza valets. Customers who pay when they place their orders are able to drive up and leave with their order very quickly without stepping out of their vehicle. For those who choose to pay after they arrive, pizza valets can take credit card payments on their mobile payment devices right at the customer's vehicle. With the fast baking times, the entire experience, from order to pick-up only takes approximately 12 minutes.

  Noble Roman’s Pizza For Non-Traditional Locations
  
 In 1997, the Company started franchising non-traditional locations (a Noble Roman’s pizza operation within some other business or activity that had existing traffic) such as entertainment facilities, hospitals, convenience stores and other types of facilities. These locations utilize the two pizza styles the Company started with in 1972, along with its great tasting, high quality ingredients and menu extensions.
  
 The hallmark of Noble Roman’s Pizza for non-traditional locations is “Superior quality that our customers can taste.” Every ingredient and process has been designed with a view to produce superior results.
  
   ●
 A fully-prepared pizza crust that captures the made-from-scratch pizzeria flavor which gets delivered to non-traditional locations in a shelf-stable condition so that dough handling is no longer an impediment to a consistent product, which otherwise is a challenge in non-traditional locations.

   ●
 Fresh packed, uncondensed and never cooked sauce made with secret spices, parmesan cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes in all venues.

   ●
 100% real cheese blended from mozzarella and Muenster, with no soy additives or extenders.

   ●
 100% real meat toppings, with no additives or extenders, a distinction compared to many pizza concepts.

   ●
 Vegetable and mushroom toppings are sliced and delivered fresh, never canned.

   ●
 An extended product line that includes breadsticks and cheesy stix with dip, pasta, baked sandwiches, salads, wings and a line of breakfast products.

   ●
 The fully-prepared crust also forms the basis for the Company’s Take-N-Bake pizza for use as an add-on component for its non-traditional franchise base as well as an offering for its grocery store license venue.

 
  Business Strategy
  
 The Company is focused on revenue expansion while continuing to minimize corporate-level overhead. To accomplish this the Company will continue owning and operating a core of Craft Pizza & Pub locations and develop what it believes to be a large growth opportunity by franchising to qualified multi-unit franchisees. At the same time, the Company will continue to focus on franchising/licensing for non-traditional locations by franchising primarily to convenience stores and entertainment centers and licensing to grocery stores.
  
 The initial franchise fees are as follows:
  
 
 | Non-Traditional Except Hospitals | Non-Traditional Hospitals | Traditional Stand-Alone
-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------+------------------------
Noble Roman’s Pizza or Craft Pizza & Pub | $7,500 | $10,000 | $30,000(1) 


 
 (1) With the sale of multiple traditional stand-alone franchises to a single franchisee, the franchise fee for the first unit is $30,000, the franchise fee for the second unit is $25,000 and the franchise fee for the third unit and any additional unit is $20,000.The Company has sold two franchises for Craft Pizza & Pub locations. One franchise is sold to the largest multi-unit Dairy Queen franchisee in Indiana with 19 franchised locations. This Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub franchised location is now under construction and is expected to open in spring 2019 in Lafayette, Indiana.
  
 The franchise fees are paid upon signing the franchise agreement and, when paid, are non-refundable in consideration of the administration and other expenses incurred by the Company in granting the franchises and for the lost and/or deferred opportunities to grant such franchises to any other party.
  
 The Company’s proprietary ingredients are manufactured pursuant to the Company’s recipes and formulas by third-party manufacturers under contracts between the Company and its various manufacturers. These contracts require the manufacturers to produce ingredients meeting the Company’s specifications and to sell them to Company-approved distributors at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturer.
  
 The Company utilizes distributors it has strategically identified across the United States. The distributor agreements require the distributors to maintain adequate inventories of all ingredients necessary to meet the needs of the Company’s franchisees and licensees in their distribution areas for weekly deliveries.

  Competition
  
 The restaurant industry and the retail food industry in general are very competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Actions by one or more of the Company’s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses, maintain and renew existing franchises or licenses, or sell its products. Many of the Company’s competitors are very large, internationally established companies.
  
 Within the environment in which we compete management has identified what it believes to be certain competitive advantages for the Company. Many of the Company’s competitors in the non-traditional venue were established with little or no organizational history operating traditional foodservice locations. This lack of operating experience may limit their ability to attract and maintain non-traditional franchisees or licensees who, by the nature of the venue, often have little exposure to foodservice operations themselves. The Company’s background in traditional restaurant operations has provided it experience in structuring, planning, marketing, and controlling costs of franchise or license unit operations which may be of material benefit to franchisees or licensees.
  
 The Company’s Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub format competes with similar restaurants in its service area. Some of the competitors are company-owned and some are franchised locations of large chains and others are independently owned. Some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company.
  
  Seasonality of Sales
  
 Bad winter weather conditions tend to adversely affect sales, especially those of the Craft Pizza & Pubs which are designed for in-store dining and carry-out, which in turn affects Company revenue. Sales of non-traditional franchises or licenses may be affected by seasonalities and holiday periods. Sales to certain non-traditional venues may be slower around major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, and during the first quarter of the year. Product sales of the non-traditional franchises/licenses may be slower during the first quarter of the year and certain venues such as grocery stores are typically slower during the summer months.
 Employees
  
 As of March 4, 2019, the Company employed approximately 28 persons full-time and 93 persons on a part-time, hourly basis, of which 16 of the full-time employees are employed in sales and service of the franchise/license units and 12 in restaurant locations. No employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good.
 Trademarks and Service Marks
  
 The Company owns and protects several trademarks and service marks. Many of these, including NOBLE ROMAN’S®, Noble Roman’s Pizza®, THE BETTER PIZZA PEOPLE®, “Noble Roman’s Take-N-Bake Pizza,”“Noble Roman’s Craft Pizza & Pub®,” and “Tuscano’s Italian Style Subs®,” are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as with the corresponding agencies of certain other foreign governments. The Company believes that its trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to its sales and marketing efforts.
 Government Regulation
  
 The Company and its franchisees and licensees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of the respective businesses. Each location, including the Company’s Craft Pizza & Pub locations, are subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building, employment, alcohol and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a location. Vendors, such as our third-party production and distribution services, are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and U. S. Department of Transportation regulations. The Company, its franchisees, licensees and vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, as well as laws and regulations relating to minimum wage and other employment-related matters. In certain circumstances, the Company is, or soon may be, subject to various local, state and/or federal laws requiring disclosure of nutritional and/or ingredient information concerning the Company’s products, its packaging, menu boards and/or other literature. Changes in the laws and rules applicable to the Company or its franchisees or licensees, or their interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
  
 The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires the Company to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for additional federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company is subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchised units.
