ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Haemonetics is a global healthcare company dedicated to providing a suite of innovative hematology products and solutions to customers to help improve patient care and reduce the cost of healthcare. Our technology addresses important medical markets including blood and plasma component collection, the surgical suite, and hospital transfusion services. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” mean Haemonetics.
Blood is essential to a modern healthcare system. Blood and its components (plasma, platelets and red cells) have many vital and frequently life-saving clinical applications. Plasma is used for patients with major blood loss and is manufactured into biopharmaceuticals to treat a variety of illnesses, including immune diseases and coagulation disorders. Red cells treat trauma patients or patients undergoing surgery with high blood loss, such as open heart surgery or organ transplant. Platelets have many uses in patient care, including supporting cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. 
Haemonetics develops and markets a wide range of devices and solutions to serve our customers. We provide plasma collection systems and software that enable the collection of plasma used by biopharmaceutical companies to make life saving pharmaceuticals and also provides analytical devices for measuring hemostasis that enable healthcare providers to better manage their patients’ bleeding risk. In addition, Haemonetics makes blood processing systems and software that make blood donation more efficient and track life giving blood components. Finally, Haemonetics supplies systems and software that facilitate blood transfusions and cell processing. 
Market and Products
Product Lines
Our products are organized in three categories for purposes of evaluating and developing their growth potential: Plasma, Blood Center, and Hospital. For that purpose, “Plasma” includes plasma collection devices and disposables, plasma donor management software and anticoagulant and saline sold to plasma customers. “Blood Center” includes blood collection and processing devices and disposables for red cells, platelets and whole blood as well as related donor management software. “Hospital”, which is comprised of Hemostasis Management and Cell Processing products, includes devices and methodologies for measuring coagulation characteristics of blood, surgical blood salvage systems, specialized blood cell processing systems, disposables and blood transfusion management software. 
We believe that Plasma and Hospital have growth potential, while Blood Center competes in challenging markets which require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs, shrinking the scope of the current product line, and evaluating opportunities to exit unfavorable customer contracts.

• | Plasma

Our Plasma business offers automated plasma collection and donor management software systems that improve the plasma centers’ yield, efficiency, quality, safety and overall plasma donor experience. We continue to invest in technology that lowers the overall cost to collect plasma while maintaining high standards of quality and safety.
Plasma Collection Market for Fractionation — Human plasma is collected for two purposes. First, it is used for transfusions in patients with extreme blood loss, such as trauma victims, and second, it is processed into pharmaceuticals that aid in the treatment of immune diseases and coagulation disorders. 
Plasma for transfusion is almost exclusively collected by blood centers as part of their broader mission to supply blood components. Plasma that is fractionated and manufactured into pharmaceuticals - frequently referred to as source plasma - is mainly collected by vertically integrated biopharmaceutical companies who operate their own collection centers and recruit donors specifically for source plasma donation. The markets for transfusion plasma and source plasma have different participants, product requirements and growth profiles. We serve the market for transfusion plasma through our Blood Center products.
One of the distinguishing features of the source plasma market is the method of collection. There are three primary ways to collect plasma. The first is to collect it from whole blood donations. When whole blood is processed, plasma

can be separated at the same time as red cells and platelets and stored for future use. The second is as part of an apheresis procedure that also collects another blood component. These two methods are mainly used by blood centers to collect plasma for transfusions. The third method is a dedicated apheresis procedure that only collects plasma and returns the other blood components to the donor. This method is mainly used for source plasma. 
Our Plasma business unit focuses on the collection of plasma for pharmaceutical production using apheresis devices that collect plasma and software solutions that support the efficient operation of source plasma collection centers. Our Blood Center business unit supports the collection of plasma for transfusion using both whole blood and multi-component apheresis collection devices and software solutions that support efficient operation of these types of centers.
Over the last 20 years, the collection of source plasma has increasingly been done by vertically integrated biopharmaceutical companies such as CSL Behring, Grifols S.A. ("Grifols"), Octapharma AG and Takeda's BioLife business. With their global operations and management expertise, these companies are focused on efficient plasma supply chain management and leveraging information technology to manage operations from the point of plasma donation to fractionation to the production of the final product.
Demand for source plasma has continued to grow as an expanding end user market for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals - in particular, therapies that require a significant quantity of plasma to create - has fueled an increase in the number of donations and dedicated collection centers. A significant portion of this growth has occurred in the United States with U.S. produced plasma now meeting an increasing percentage of plasma volume demand worldwide. The U.S. has regulations that are significantly favorable relative to other markets for plasma collectors. The frequency with which a donor may donate, the volume of plasma that may be donated each time and the ability to remunerate donors are all optimal in the U.S., leading to approximately 80% of worldwide source plasma collections occurring in the U.S. Plasma collectors have long sought changes to plasma collection regulations outside of the U.S. to allow for greater frequency, volume per donation and remuneration but achievements have been meager and slow and no changes are foreseen in the prevalence of U.S. collections.
Plasma Products — Built around our automated plasma collection devices, related disposables and software, our portfolio of products and services is designed to support multiple facets of plasma collector operations. We have a long-standing commitment to understanding our customers' collection and manufacturing processes. As a result, we aim to design equipment that is durable, dependable and easy to use and to provide comprehensive training and support to our plasma collection customers. 
Today, the vast majority of plasma collections worldwide are performed using automated collection technology at dedicated facilities. We offer multiple products to support these dedicated source plasma operations, including our NexSys PCS® and PCS2® plasmapheresis equipment and related disposables including plasma collection containers and intravenous solutions. We also offer a portfolio of integrated information technology platforms for plasma customers to manage their donors, operations and supply chain. Our software products, including our latest NexLynk DMS® donor management system, automate the donor interview and qualification process, streamline the workflow process in the plasma center, provide the controls necessary to evaluate donor suitability, determine the ability to release units collected and manage unit distribution. With our software solutions, plasma collectors can manage processes across the plasma supply chain, ensure quality and compliance business process support, react quickly to business changes and implement opportunities to reduce costs.
With our PCS brand, we have provided an automated platform dedicated to the collection of plasma for over 20 years. In fiscal 2018, we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") 510(k) clearance for our next generation device, the NexSys PCS and for the enhancement of our NexSys PCS embedded software that activates YESTM technology, a yield-enhancing solution that enables increases in plasma yield per collection by an additional 18-26 mL per donation, on average. We also received CE mark clearance of the NexSys PCS device in the European Union and Australia, subject to additional local requirements, during fiscal 2018. We expect to pursue further regulatory clearances for additional enhancements to the overall product offering. 
NexSys PCS is designed to enable higher plasma yield collections, improve productivity in our customers’ centers, enhance the overall donor experience and provide safe and reliable collections that will become life-changing medicines for patients. NexSys PCS includes bi-directional connectivity to the NexLynk DMS donor management system to improve operational efficiency within plasma centers, through automated programming of donation procedures and automated data capture of procedure data. 
2

We have entered into several long-term commercial contracts and are continuing the rollout and support of NexSys PCS devices and NexLynk DMS donor management software for these Plasma customers.
Our Plasma business unit represented 51.9%, 48.2% and 46.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

• | Blood Center

Our Blood Center business offers a range of solutions that improve donor collections centers ability for acquiring blood, filtering blood and separating blood components. We continue to look for solutions to improve donor safety and control costs through the existing product portfolio. Our products and technologies help donor collection centers optimize blood collection capabilities and donor processing management.
Blood Center Market — There are millions of blood donations throughout the world every year that produce blood products for transfusion to surgical, trauma, or chronically ill patients. Patients typically receive only the blood components necessary to treat a particular clinical condition. Platelet therapy is frequently used to alleviate the effects of chemotherapy and to help patients with bleeding disorders. Red cells are often transfused to patients to replace blood lost during surgery and transfused to patients with blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or aplastic anemia. Plasma, in addition to its role in creating life-saving pharmaceuticals, is frequently transfused to replace blood volume in trauma victims and surgical patients.
When collecting blood components there are two primary collection methods, manual whole blood donations and automated component blood collections. While most donations are manual whole blood, the benefit of automated component blood collections is the ability to collect more than one unit of the targeted blood component. Manual whole blood donations are collected from the donor and then transported to a laboratory where the blood is separated into its components. Automated component blood collections separate the blood component real-time while a person is donating blood. In this method, only the specific target blood component is collected and the remaining components are returned to the blood donor.
While overall we expect total demand for blood to remain stable to slightly declining, demand in individual markets can vary greatly. Mature markets have developed more minimally invasive procedures with lower associated blood loss, as well as better blood management that have more than offset the increasing demand from aging populations. Emerging markets are seeing demand growth with expanded healthcare coverage and greater access to more advanced medical treatments.
Blood Center Products — We offer automated blood component and manual whole blood collection systems to blood collection centers to collect blood products efficiently and cost effectively. In addition, we offer software solutions that help blood collection centers with blood drive planning, donor recruitment and retention, blood collection, component manufacturing and distribution.

• | We market the MCS® brand apheresis equipment which is designed to collect specific blood components from the donor. Utilizing the MCS automated platelet collection protocols, blood centers collect one or more therapeutic “doses” of platelets during a single donation.


• | Our portfolio of disposable whole blood collection and component storage sets offer flexibility in collecting a unit of whole blood and the subsequent production and storage of blood components, including options for in-line or dockable filters for leukoreduction.


• | Our SafeTrace Tx® and El-Dorado Donor® donation and blood unit management systems span blood center operations and automate and track operations from the recruitment of the blood donor to the disposition of the blood product.


• | Our Hemasphere® software solution provides support for more efficient blood drive planning and Donor Doc® and e-Donor® software help to improve donor recruitment and retention.

Our Blood Center business unit represented 27.8%, 31.5% and 34.3% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

• | Hospital

Hospitals are called upon to provide the highest standard of patient care while at the same time reduce operating costs. Haemonetics' Hospital business has three product lines - Hemostasis Management, Cell Salvage and Transfusion Management - that help decision makers in hospitals optimize blood acquisition, storage and usage in critical settings.

Hemostasis Management
Hemostasis Management Market — Hemostasis refers to a patient's ability to form and maintain blood clots. The clinical management of hemostasis requires that physicians have the most complete information to make decisions on how to best maintain a patient’s coagulation equilibrium between hemorrhage (bleeding) and thrombosis (clotting). Hemostasis is a critical challenge in various medical procedures, including cardiovascular surgery, organ transplantation, trauma, post-partum hemorrhage and percutaneous coronary intervention. By understanding a patient’s hemostasis status, clinicians can better plan for the patient’s care pathway. For example, they may decide whether to start or discontinue the use of certain drugs or to determine the need for a transfusion and which specific blood components would be most effective in minimizing blood loss and reducing clotting risk. Such planning supports better care, which can lead to lower hospital costs through a reduction in unnecessary blood product transfusions, reduced adverse transfusion reactions and shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays.
Hemostasis Management Products — Our portfolio of TEG® diagnostic systems enables clinicians to holistically assess the coagulation status of a patient at the point-of-care or laboratory setting. We have two device platforms that we market to hospitals and laboratories as an alternative to routine blood tests: the TEG 5000 hemostasis analyzer system, which we obtained in the 2007 acquisition of assets from Haemoscope Corporation, and the TEG 6s hemostasis analyzer system, the underlying technology for which we license from Cora Healthcare, Inc., a company established by Haemoscope's founders. Under the license from Cora Healthcare, we have exclusive perpetual rights to manufacture and commercialize the TEG 6s system in the field of hospitals and hospital laboratories.
Each TEG system consists of an analyzer that is used with single-use reagents and disposables. In addition, TEG Manager® software connects multiple TEG analyzers throughout the hospital, providing clinicians remote access to both active and historical test results that inform treatment decisions.
The TEG 5000 system is approved for a broad set of indications in all of our markets. The TEG 6s system is approved for the same set of indications as the TEG 5000 in Europe, Australia and Japan. We continue to pursue a broader set of indications for TEG 6s in the U.S. In May 2019, we received FDA clearance for the use of TEG 6s in adult trauma settings. This clearance builds on the current indication for the TEG 6s system in cardiovascular surgery and cardiology procedures, making it the first cartridge-based system available in the U.S. to evaluate the hemostasis condition in adult trauma patients.
Cell Processing
Cell Salvage
Cell Salvage Market — The Cell Salvage market is mainly comprised of devices designed to transfuse back a patient’s own blood during or after surgery. Loss of blood is common in many surgical procedures, including open heart, trauma, transplant, vascular and orthopedic procedures, and the need for transfusion of oxygen-carrying red cells to make up for lost blood volume is routine. Patients commonly receive donor (or allogeneic) blood which carries various risks for transfusion reactions including chills, fevers or other side effects that can prolong a patient’s recovery.
An alternative to allogeneic blood is surgical cell salvage, also known as autotransfusion, which reduces or eliminates a patient’s need for blood donated from others and ensures that the patient receives the freshest and safest blood possible - his or her own. Surgical cell salvage involves the collection of a patient’s own blood during or after surgery for reinfusion of red cells to that patient. Blood is suctioned from the surgical site or collected from a wound or chest drain, processed and washed through a centrifuge-based system that yields concentrated red cells available for transfusion back to the patient. This process occurs in a sterile, closed-circuit, single-use consumable set that is fitted into an electromechanical device. We market our surgical blood salvage products to surgical specialists, primarily cardiovascular, orthopedic and trauma surgeons, and to anesthesiologists and surgical suite service providers.
Cell Salvage Products — Our Cell Saver® Elite®+ autologous blood recovery system is a surgical blood salvage system targeted to medium to high blood loss procedures, such as cardiovascular, orthopedic, trauma, transplant, vascular, obstetrical and gynecological surgeries. The Cell Saver Elite + is designed to minimize allogeneic blood use and reliably recover and transfuse a patient’s own high-quality blood.
Our OrthoPAT® perioperative autotranfusion system is targeted to orthopedic procedures and is designed to remain with the patient following surgery, to recover blood and produce a washed red cell product for autotransfusion. We discontinued the sale of our OrthoPAT products effective March 31, 2019. We offer the Cell Saver Elite + as an alternative autotransfusion system for orthopedics or other medium to low blood loss procedures.

Transfusion Management
Transfusion Management Market — Hospital transfusion services professionals and clinicians are facing cost restraints in addition to the pressure to enhance patient safety, compliance and operational efficiency. Managing the safety and traceability of the blood supply chain and comprehensive management of patients, orders, specimens, blood products, derivatives and accessories across the hospital network is challenging. In addition, providing clinicians with the vital access to blood when needed most while maintaining traceability is a key priority. Frequently when blood products leave the blood bank, the transfusion management staff loses control and visibility of the blood components. They often do not know if the blood was handled, stored or transfused properly, which may lead to negative effects on patient safety, product quality, inventory availability and staff efficiency as well as increased waste.
Transfusion Management Products — Our Transfusion Management solutions are designed to help provide safety, traceability and compliance from the hospital blood bank to the patient bedside and enable consistent care across the hospital network. The SafeTrace Tx® transfusion management software is considered the system of record for all hospital blood bank and transfusion service information. BloodTrack® blood management software is a modular suite of blood management and bedside transfusion solutions that combines software with hardware components and acts as an extension of the hospital’s blood bank information system. The software is designed to work with storage devices, including the BloodTrack HaemoBank® blood storage device.
Our Hospital business unit represented 20.3%, 20.3% and 19.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Marketing/Sales/Distribution
We market and sell our products to biopharmaceutical companies, blood collection groups and independent blood centers, hospitals and hospital service providers, group purchasing organizations and national health organizations through our own direct sales force (including full-time sales representatives and clinical specialists) as well as independent distributors. Sales representatives target the primary decision-makers within each of those organizations.
Research and Development
Our research and development centers in the U.S. ensure that protocol variations are incorporated to closely match local customer requirements. In addition, Haemonetics maintains software development operations in Canada and France.
Customer collaborations are also an important part of our technical strength and competitive advantage. These collaborations with customers and transfusion experts provide us with ideas for new products and applications, enhanced protocols and potential test sites as well as objective evaluations and expert opinions regarding technical and performance issues.
The development of blood component separation products, hemostasis analyzers and software has required us to maintain technical expertise in various engineering disciplines, including mechanical, electrical, software, biomedical engineering and chemistry. Innovations resulting from these various engineering efforts enable us to develop systems that are faster, smaller and more user-friendly, or that incorporate additional features important to our customer base.
In fiscal 2019, research and development resources were allocated to support innovation across our portfolio, including investments in clinical programs for our Hemostasis Management product line. A key element of our strategy in the U.S. for our Hemostasis Management product line has been to invest in clinical trials to support expanded FDA labeling including a trauma indication for our TEG 6s. In May 2019, we received FDA clearance for the use of TEG 6s in adult trauma settings. This clearance builds on the current indication for the TEG 6s system in cardiovascular surgery and cardiology procedures, making it the first cartridge-based system available in the U.S. to evaluate the hemostasis condition in adult trauma patients. Additionally, we continue to invest resources in next generation plasma collection and software systems.
Manufacturing
We endeavor to supply products that are both high quality and cost competitive for our customers by leveraging continuous improvement methodologies, focusing on our core competencies and partnering with strategic suppliers that complement our capabilities. In general, we design our equipment and consumables and use contract manufacturers to build the devices, while the majority of consumables are manufactured by us. 
Our production activities occur in controlled settings or “clean room” environments and have built-in quality checks throughout the manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing teams are focused on continuously improving our productivity, product cost and product quality through change control procedures, validations and strong supplier management programs. We regularly review our logistics capabilities, inventory and safety stock levels and maintain business continuity plans to address supply disruptions that may occur.  
5


Our primary consumable manufacturing operations are located in North America and Malaysia. Contract manufacturers also supply component sets and liquid solutions according to our specifications and manufacture in Mexico, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines. Our devices are principally manufactured in Malaysia, Australia and the U.S. 

Plastics and other petroleum-based products are the principal component of our disposable products and can be affected by oil and gas prices. Contracts with our suppliers help to mitigate some of the short term effects of price volatility in this market. However, increases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials.
Intellectual Property
We consider our intellectual property rights to be important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as provisions in our agreements with third parties, to protect our intellectual property rights. 
We hold numerous patents in the United States and have applied for numerous additional U.S. patents relating to our products and related technologies. We also own or have applied for corresponding patents in selected foreign countries. These patents cover certain elements of our products and processes, including protocols employed in our equipment and aspects of certain our disposables. Our patents may cover current products, products in markets we plan to enter, or products in markets we plan to license to others, or the patents may be defensive in that they are directed to technologies not currently embodied in our current products. We also license patent rights from third parties that cover technologies that we use or plan to use in our business. 
We own various trademarks that have been registered in the United States and certain other countries.
Our policy is to obtain patent and trademark rights in the U.S. and foreign countries where such rights are available and we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. However, the standards for international protection of intellectual property vary widely. We cannot assure that pending patent and trademark applications will result in issued patents and registered trademarks, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that our patents will not be determined invalid.
To maintain our competitive position, we also rely on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel. We believe that unpatented know-how and trade secrets relied upon in connection with our business and products are generally as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage.
Competition
To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new cost-effective products, information technology platforms and business services. We believe that our ability to maintain a competitive advantage will continue to depend on a combination of factors. Some factors are largely within our control such as: (i) maintenance of a positive reputation among our customers, (ii) development of new products that meet our customer's needs, (iii) obtaining regulatory approvals for our products in key markets, (iv) obtaining patents that protect our innovations, (v) development and protection of proprietary know-how in important technological areas, (vi) product quality, safety and cost effectiveness and (vii) continual and rigorous documentation of clinical performance. Other factors are outside of our control. We could see changes in regulatory standards or clinical practice that favor a competitor's technology or reduce revenues in key areas of our business.
Our technical staff is highly skilled, but certain competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger technical staff at their disposal. There can be no assurance that competitors will not direct substantial efforts and resources toward the development and marketing of products competitive with those of Haemonetics.
In addition, we face competition from several large, global companies with product offerings similar to ours. Terumo BCT and Fresenius SE & Co. KGaA, in particular, have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and are strong competitors in a number of our businesses. The following provides an overview of the key competitors in each of our three global product enterprises.

• | Plasma

In the automated plasma collection market, we principally compete with Fresenius' Fenwal Aurora and Aurora Xi product line, on the basis of speed, plasma yield per donation, quality, reliability, ease of use, services and technical features of the collection systems and on the long-term cost-effectiveness of equipment and disposables. In China, the market is populated by local producers of a product that is intended to be similar to ours. Recently, those competitors have expanded to markets beyond China, including European and South American countries. In the field of plasma related software, MAK Systems is the primary competitor along with applications developed internally by our customers.

• | Blood Center

Most donations worldwide are traditional manual whole blood collections and approximately 40% of the Blood Center portfolio competes in this space. We face intense competition in our whole blood business on the basis of quality and price. Our main competitors are Fresenius, MacoPharma and Terumo.
Our MCS automated component blood collections, which represents approximately 55% of the Blood Center portfolio, not only compete against the traditional manual whole blood collection market (particularly in red cells) but also compete with products from Terumo and Fresenius. Technology is the key differentiator in automated component blood collections, as measured by the time to collect more than one unit of a specific targeted blood component. While not all donors are eligible to donate more than one unit, it continues to become more prevalent in markets with a significant number of eligible donors. Therefore, both Haemonetics and our competitors continue to experience downward pressure on collection of single platelet collection procedures.
In Blood Center software, MAK Technologies is a competitor along with systems developed internally by our customers. Our software portfolio is predominately a U.S. based business.

• | Hospital

Hemostasis Management
The TEG hemostasis analyzer system is used primarily in surgical applications. Competition includes routine coagulation tests, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet count marketed by various manufacturers, such as Instrumentation Laboratory, Diagnostica Stago SAS and Sysmex. The TEG analyzer competes with these routine laboratory tests based on its ability to provide a more complete picture of a patient's hemostasis at a single point in time and to measure the clinically relevant platelet function for an individual patient.
In addition, TEG systems compete more directly with other advanced blood test systems, including ROTEM® analyzers, the VerifyNow® System and HemoSonics Quantra™. ROTEM and VerifyNow instruments are marketed by Instrumentation Laboratory, a subsidiary of Werfen. HemoSonics is owned and offered by Diagnostica Stago. There are also additional technologies being explored to assess viscoelastic and other characteristics that can provide insights into the coagulation status of a patient. 
Cell Processing
Cell Salvage
In the intraoperative autotransfusion market, competition is based on reliability, ease of use, service, support and price. For high-volume platforms, each manufacturer's technology is similar and our Cell Saver technology competes principally with products offered by LivaNova PLC, Medtronic and Fresenius.
Transfusion Management
SafeTrace Tx and BloodTrack compete in the transfusion management software market within the broader category of hospital information systems. SafeTrace Tx is an FDA regulated blood bank information system ("BBIS") that integrates and communicates with other healthcare information systems such as the electronic health record and laboratory information system within the hospital. The BloodTrack software, also FDA regulated, is an extension of the BBIS and provides secure, traceable blood units at the point-of-care, including trauma, surgery, outpatient and critical care settings. Growth drivers for these markets include patient safety, operational efficiencies and compliance. 
SafeTrace Tx competition primarily consists of stand-alone BBIS including WellSky and some Electronic Health Record software that includes a built-in transfusion management solution including Cerner. Global competition for BloodTrack varies by country including MSoft in Europe and established blood practices in the U.S. such as using standard refrigerators and manual movement of blood products. BloodTrack integrates with the hospital’s existing lab or blood bank system allowing for greater market acceptance.
Significant Customers
In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 52%, 45% and 42% of our net revenues, respectively. In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, two of our Plasma customers, CSL Plasma Inc. ("CSL") and Grifols, each were greater than 10% of total net revenues and in total accounted for approximately 27%, 26% and 24% of our net revenues, 
7

respectively. Additionally, one of our Blood Center customers accounted for greater than 10% of our Japan segment’s net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Government Regulation
Due to the variety of products that we manufacture, we and our products are subject to a wide variety of regulations by numerous government agencies, including the FDA, and similar agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products.
Medical Device Regulation
Premarket Requirements - U.S.
Unless an exemption applies, all medical devices introduced to the U.S. market since 1976 are required by the FDA, as a condition of marketing, to secure either a 510(k) pre-market notification clearance or an approved premarket approval application, or PMA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose a low or moderate risk are placed in class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution, unless the device type is exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in class III, requiring submission and approval of a PMA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy and require payment of significant user fees.  
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the notification is submitted, but it can take considerably longer, depending on the extent of FDA's requests for additional information and the amount of time a sponsor takes to fulfill them. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. 
A PMA must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process. To date, we have no PMA approved products and do not have any class III products on our product pipeline.
Postmarket Requirements - U.S.
After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include, among others:

• | FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;


• | Labeling regulations including unique device identification;


• | Clearance of a 510(k) for certain product modifications;


• | Medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;


• | Medical device correction and removal (recall) reporting regulations; and


• | An order of repair, replacement or refund.

Additionally, we and the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers are subject to unannounced inspections by FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations described above. The FDA can issue warning letters or untitled letters, impose injunctions, suspend regulatory clearance or approvals, ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations.

Requirements Outside the U.S.
The regulatory review process varies from country to country and may in some cases require the submission of clinical data. Our international sales are subject to regulatory requirements in the countries in which our products are sold. These regulations will be significantly modified in the next couple of years. For example, in May 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745) was adopted. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, or EU MDR, repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. The EU MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The EU MDR will, however, only become applicable three years after publication (in May 2020). Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:

• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities;


• | improve the traceability of medical devices;


• | set up a central database to provide comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices before they are placed on the market.

In the meantime, the current EU Medical Devices Directive continues to apply. 
Drug Regulation 
Development and Approval
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, FDA approval of a new drug application, or NDA, is required before any new drug can be marketed in the U.S. Under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, FDA licensure of a biologics license application, or BLA, is required before a biologic can be marketed in the U.S. NDAs and BLAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant.
A generic version of an approved drug is approved by means of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, by which the sponsor demonstrates that the proposed product is the same as the approved, brand-name drug, which is referred to as the “reference listed drug,” or RLD. Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, are intended for the same uses and are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA previously found to be safe and effective.
We currently hold NDAs and ANDAs for liquid solutions (including anticoagulants, intravenous saline and a red blood cell storage solution), which we sell with our blood component and whole blood collection systems.
Post-Approval Regulation
After the FDA permits a drug to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices, which include a series of requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls and records and reports; labeling regulations; advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions; and regulations regarding conducting recalls of product. 
Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug or biological products.
Requirements Outside the U.S.
We must obtain the requisite marketing authorizations from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to marketing of a product in those countries. The requirements and process governing product licensing vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled 
9

letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.
Conflict Minerals
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of "Conflict Minerals" mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold and their derivatives. These requirements could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products. There will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In addition, we are subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. We have described below some of the key federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that apply to our business.
The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between manufacturers of federally reimbursed products on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and others in a position to recommend, refer, or order federally reimbursed products on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend medical devices or pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging consultants as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants. Liability may be established without a person or entity having actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fraudulent or materially incomplete claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In recent years, companies in the healthcare industry have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product or causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved and thus non-reimbursable, uses. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of tens of thousands of dollars per false claim or statement. Healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, requires manufacturers of certain products reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to track and report to the 
10

federal government payments and transfers of value that they make to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests held by physicians and their family and provides for public disclosures of these data.
Many states have adopted analogous laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payor. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and medical device companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual health care providers; make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit specified sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers and/or offering co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. 
Other countries, including a number of EU Member States, have laws of similar application.
Environmental Matters
Failure to comply with international, federal and local environmental protection laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our business or could require material capital expenditures. We continue to monitor changes in U.S. and international environmental regulations that may present a significant risk to the business, including laws or regulations relating to the manufacture or sale of products using plastics.
Employees
As of March 30, 2019, we employed the full-time equivalent of 3,216 persons.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
Certain statements that we make from time to time, including statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference into this report, constitute “forward looking-statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “potential” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development, commercialization and anticipated performance and benefits; regulatory approvals; impact of planned acquisitions or dispositions; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. 
The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of these and other factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.

• | Failure to achieve our long-term strategic and financial-improvement goals;


• | Demand for and market acceptance risks for new and existing products, including material reductions in purchasing from or loss of a significant customer;

11


• | Product quality or safety concerns, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, regulatory action by the FDA (or similar non-U.S. regulatory agencies), reputational damage, declining sales or litigation;


• | Security breaches of our information technology systems or our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business or compromise sensitive information of the Company or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of customers' patients;


• | Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward health care cost containment, including the continued consolidation among health care providers and other market participants;


• | The continuity, availability and pricing of plastic and other raw materials, finished goods and components used in the manufacturing of our products (including those purchased from sole-source suppliers) and the related continuity of our manufacturing and distribution;


• | Our ability to develop new products or enhancements on commercially acceptable terms or at all;


• | The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;


• | Our ability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner consistent with cost estimates;


• | Our ability to comply with established and developing U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, as well as U.S. and foreign export and import restrictions and tariffs;


• | Our ability to execute and realize anticipated benefits from our investments in emerging economies;


• | Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs that we have or may undertake, including the Complexity Reduction Initiative;


• | Our ability to retain and attract key personnel;


• | Costs and risks associated with product liability and other litigation claims;


• | Our ability to meet our existing debt obligations and raise additional capital when desired on terms reasonably acceptable to us;


• | The potential effect of foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations on our net sales, expenses and resulting margins;


• | The impact of changes in U.S. and international tax laws;


• | Market conditions and the possibility that the Company’s share repurchase program may be delayed, suspended or discontinued;


• | The effect of communicable diseases on demand for our products; and


• | Our ability to protect intellectual property and the outcome of patent litigation.

Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and in Item 1A. Risk Factors to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.
