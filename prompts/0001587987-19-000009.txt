ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
We are an internally managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Additionally, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our 2015 tax year. Our investment activities are managed by our executive officers and supervised by our Board.
As a BDC, our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through loans originated by our business finance platform and our equity investments in certain portfolio companies that we control.
Our Business
We are an internally managed BDC that is a leading national non-bank lender that provides, together with our controlled portfolio companies, a wide range of business and financial solutions under the Newtek® brand to the SMB market. Newtek’s products and services include: Business Lending including SBA 7(a) loans, 504 loans and conventional loans, Electronic Payment Processing, Managed Technology Solutions (Cloud Computing), Technology Consulting, eCommerce, Accounts Receivable and Inventory Financing, personal and commercial lines Insurance Services, Web Services, Data Backup, Storage and Retrieval, and Payroll and Benefits Solutions to SMB accounts nationwide across all industries. We have an established and reliable platform that is not limited by client size, industry type or location. As a result, we believe we have a strong and diversified client base across every state in the U.S. and across a variety of different industries. In addition, we have developed a financial and technology based business model that enables us and our controlled portfolio companies to acquire and process our SMB clients in a cost effective manner. This capability is supported in large part by NewTracker®, our patented prospect management technology software which is similar to but we believe is better than the system popularized by Salesforce.com. We believe that this technology and low cost business model distinguishes us from our competitors.
We define SMBs as companies having revenues of $1,000,000 to $100,000,000. We focus on serving the SMB market, which we estimate to be over 27 million businesses in the U.S. We believe that these businesses have historically been underserved by traditional financial institutions and typically lack the capital resources to build a competitive business and marketing infrastructure on their own. Further, in today’s economic climate, we believe SMBs have particular difficulty obtaining capital from traditional lending sources. While we do not compete directly with alternative online lenders such as The Lending Club, Prosper.com, OnDeck Capital, Inc. and Kabbage Inc., we do provide financing solutions as an alternative to traditional lending. We believe there is significant demand for such alternative financing among SMBs. Our lending solutions and our controlled portfolio companies’ outsourced business solutions help clients manage and grow their businesses and compete effectively in today’s marketplace. We obtain our customers through referrals from various business partners, such as banks, insurance companies, credit unions and other affinity groups, as well as through our own direct sales force and advertising campaigns. We source, acquire and process SMB customers in a cost-effective manner without reliance on high cost sales staff and time consuming application processes.
In lending, we believe we are a leading capital provider to SMBs based on our loan volume. We originate loans through a variety of sourcing channels and through a disciplined underwriting process, and seek to achieve attractive risk-weighted returns. Our multi-faceted relationships with certain borrowers allow us to closely monitor their credit profile and take an active role in managing our investments. Further, our lending capabilities, coupled with the broad outsourced business solutions of our controlled portfolio companies, create attractive cross-selling opportunities within our client base. We believe our business model creates powerful network effects which will help drive growth and operating leverage in our business. In addition, our SBA 7(a) loans originated by NSBF are structured so that the government guaranteed portion can be rapidly sold, which, based on our historic ability to securitize the unguaranteed portions and assuming the continuation of current market conditions, allows us to quickly recover our principal and earn excess capital on each SBA 7(a) loan we originate, usually in less than a year. We may in the future determine to retain the government guaranteed or unguaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans for longer periods pending deployment of excess capital. From 2012 through December 31, 2018, NSBF has consistently been the largest non-bank SBA 7(a) lender and as of December 31, 2018 is the fourth largest SBA 7(a) lender in the U.S. based on dollar lending volume.
Newtek and its controlled portfolio companies use NewTracker®, our patented proprietary technology for receiving, processing and monitoring prospective customers. NewTracker® enables Newtek and its controlled portfolio companies to acquire SMB customers in a cost effective manner as it is all accomplished by skilled staff using state of the art technology without the need for high cost sales staff or applications processors. It also permits our referral partners to have a real time window into the back office processing of the referrals they give. NewTracker® automatically pre-populates any necessary forms or applications so the processing is efficient and also cost effective. Finally, it also identifies opportunities for the cross-sale of other Newtek branded products or services.

Business Finance Platform
SBA 7(a) Lending
Our portfolio consists of guaranteed and unguaranteed non-affiliate SBA loan investments that were made through our business finance platform, which includes NSBF, a nationally licensed SBA lender under the federal Section 7(a) loan program. The SBA is an independent government agency that facilitates one of the nation’s largest sources of SMB financing by providing credit guarantees for its loan programs. SBA 7(a) loans are partially guaranteed by the SBA, with SBA guarantees typically ranging between 75% and 90% of the principal and interest due. NSBF has a dedicated Senior Lending Team that originates and services SBA 7(a) loans to qualifying SMBs. NSBF sells the guaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans, typically within two weeks of origination, and retains the unguaranteed portion until accumulating sufficient loans for a securitization. NSBF’s securitization process is as follows. After accumulating sufficient loans, the loans are transferred to a special purpose vehicle (a “Trust”), which in turn issues notes against the Trust’s assets in a private placement. The Trust’s primary source of income for repaying the securitization notes is the cash flows generated from the unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans owned by the Trust; principal on the securitization notes will be paid by cash flow in excess of that needed to pay various fees related to the operation of the Trust and interest on the debt. Securitization notes have an expected maturity of about five years, and the Trust is dissolved when the securitization notes are paid in full.
We intend to continue to expand our business finance platform primarily by expanding senior secured lending through NSBF. We believe NSBF’s SBA license, combined with NSBF’s PLP designation, provides us with a distinct competitive advantage over other SMB lenders that have not overcome these significant barriers-to-entry in our primary loan market. NSBF originated approximately $469,176,000 of SBA 7(a) loans during 2018 and approximately $385,882,000 of SBA 7(a) loans during 2017. We believe that we will continue to be introduced to a variety of high-quality investment opportunities through our existing loan sourcing channels and our controlled portfolio companies’ relationships with their clients, and our status as a BDC which helps fuel the growth of our loan portfolio by providing us with better access to lower-cost capital. 
Under the SBA’s 7(a) lending program, a bank or other lender such as NSBF underwrites a loan between $50,000 and $5,000,000 for a variety of general business purposes based on the SBA’s guidelines and the SBA provides a partial guarantee on the loan. Depending on the loan size, the SBA typically guarantees between 75% and 90% of the principal and interest due. The recoveries and expenses on the unguaranteed portions of these loans are shared pari passu between the SBA and the lender, which substantially reduces the loss severity on the unguaranteed portion of a loan for SBA 7(a) loan investors. SBA 7(a) loans are typically between five and 25 years in maturity, four to five years in duration and bear interest at the prime rate plus a spread from 2.25% to 2.75%. Since the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, lenders may, and frequently do, sell the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans in the capital markets, hold the unguaranteed portion and retain all loan servicing rights.
NSBF has a dedicated capital markets team that sells the guaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans and sells or securitizes the unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans. Historically, NSBF has sold the guaranteed portions of its originated SBA 7(a) loans shortly after origination and retained the unguaranteed portions until accumulating sufficient loans for a securitization. NSBF has typically sold SBA guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans at premiums ranging from 106% to 120% of par value, and any portion of the premium that is above 110% of par value is shared equally between NSBF and the SBA. Since December 2010, NSBF has maintained its securitization program for unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans and has successfully completed nine securitization transactions with Standard & Poor’s AA or A ratings and attractive advance rates as high as 83.5% of par value. NSBF’s most recent and largest securitization to date occurred in November 2018, when it sold $108,551,000 of unguaranteed SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes. NSBF intends to complete additional securitizations in the future which may be on comparable although not necessarily identical terms and conditions. We may determine to retain the government guaranteed or unguaranteed portions of loans for longer periods, pending deployment of excess capital.
NSBF’s senior lending team has focused on making smaller loans, approximately $1,000,000 or less, in order to maintain a diversified pool of loans that are dispersed both geographically and among industries, which limits NSBF’s exposure to regional and industry-specific economic downturns. Specifically, as of December 31, 2018, NSBF’s loan portfolio consisted of 1,960 loans originated across 50 states in 77 different industries as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”). The following charts summarize NSBF’s mix of investment concentrations by industry and geography as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands):

NSBF evaluates the credit quality of its loan portfolio by employing a risk rating system that is similar to the Uniform Classification System, which is the asset classification system adopted by the Federal Financial Institution Examinations Council. NSBF’s risk rating system is granular with multiple risk ratings in both the Acceptable and Substandard categories. Assignment of the ratings are predicated upon numerous factors, including credit risk scores, collateral type, loan to value ratios, industry, financial health of the business, payment history, other internal metrics/analysis, and qualitative assessments. Risk ratings are refreshed as appropriate based upon considerations such as market conditions, loan characteristics, and portfolio trends. NSBF’s gross SBA loans by credit quality indicator are as follows:
Risk Rating

Portfolio | Number of Loans | Aggregate Balance ($) | | Average Balance ($) | Percentage of Balance
Risk Rating 1 - 4 | 1,808 | | $ | 318,140 | | $ | 176 | | | 89.5 | %
Risk Rating 5 | 4 | | 903 | | 226 | | | 0.3 | %

Total | 1,960 | | $ | 355,589 | | $ | 181 | | | 100.0 | %

The weighted average term to maturity and weighted average interest rate of NSBF’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 was 15.7 years and 7.9%, respectively.
Receivables Financing, Inventory Financing and SBA 504 Lending
The Company’s business finance platform also includes NBC and NBL, both controlled portfolio companies. NBC provides receivables financing, inventory financing and health care receivables financing, and management services to SMBs, which may obtain $10,000 to $2,000,000 per month through the sale of their trade receivables or the financing or their inventories. In addition, NBL funds SBA 504 loans which provide financing of fixed assets such as real estate or equipment. 
Third Party Loan Servicing
SBL, a wholly owned, controlled portfolio company, engages in third-party loan servicing for SBA and non-SBA loans. An additional wholly owned portfolio company, BSP, provides lending institutions with outsourced solutions for the entire SBA lending process, including credit analysis, structuring and eligibility, packaging, closing compliance and servicing.
Controlled Portfolio Companies
In addition to our debt investments in portfolio companies, either directly or through our business finance platform, we also hold controlling interests in certain portfolio companies that, as of December 31, 2018, represented approximately 32% of our total investment portfolio. Specifically, we hold controlling interests in NMS, Mobil Money, NTS, SBL, NBC, NBL, BSP, NPS, NIA, IPM, and SIDCO. We refer to these entities (among others), collectively, as our “controlled portfolio companies.” Our controlled portfolio companies provide us with an extensive network of business relationships that supplement our referral sources and that we believe will help us to maintain a robust pipeline of lending opportunities and expand our business finance platform.
The revenues that our controlled portfolio companies generate, after deducting operating expenses, may be distributed to us. As a BDC, our Board will determine quarterly the fair value of our controlled portfolio companies in a similar manner as our other investments. In particular, our investments in our controlled portfolio companies are valued using a valuation methodology that incorporates both the market approach (guideline public company method) and the income approach (discounted cash flow analysis). In following these approaches, factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading comparables, the portfolio company’s earnings and discounted cash flows of forecasted future earnings, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, and enterprise values, among other factors. In addition, the Company has engaged third party valuation firms to provide valuation consulting services for the valuation of certain of our controlled portfolio companies.
Newtek Merchant Solutions (NMS)
NMS (a 2001 investment) markets credit and debit card processing services, check approval services and ancillary processing equipment and software to merchants who accept credit cards, debit cards, checks and other non-cash forms of payment. NMS utilizes a multi-pronged sales approach of both direct and indirect sales. NMS’ primary sales efforts focus on direct sales through our Your Business Solutions Company® brand. Their indirect sales channels consist of alliance partners, principally financial institutions (banks, credit unions, insurance companies and other related businesses), and independent sales agents across the U.S. These referring organizations and associations are typically paid a percentage of the processing revenue derived from the respective merchants that they successfully refer to NMS. In 2018, NMS processed merchant transactions with sales volumes of $6.1 billion.
NMS has a number of competitive advantages which we believe will enable it to exceed industry growth averages. These are:

• | focus on non-traditional business generation: referral relationships, wholesale solicitations and financial institutions rather than independent sales agents;


• | seeks to be a market leader in the implementation of technology in the payment processing business;


• | It maintains its own staff of trained and skilled customer service representatives; and


• | It markets and sells the latest in point-of-sale technology hardware, implementing of the EMV system (Europay, MasterCard, Visa inter-operative integrated circuit cards) and continuous cyber-security services.

NMS maintains its principal customer service and sales support offices in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Lake Success, New York, with additional specialists located in Phoenix, Arizona. NMS’s personnel assist merchants with initial installation of equipment and on-going service, as well as any other special processing needs that they may have.
NMS’ development and growth are focused on selling their services to internally generated referrals, merchant referrals identified by Newtek alliance partners and by independent sales representatives. We believe NMS is different than most electronic payment processing companies who acquire their clients primarily through independent agents. NMS believes that its business model provides it with a competitive advantage by enabling it to acquire new merchant customers at a lower cost level for third-party commissions than the industry average. NMS’ business model allows it to own the customer as well as the stream of residual payments, as opposed to models which rely more heavily on independent sales agents.
Newtek Technology Solutions (NTS)
NTS offers website hosting, dedicated server hosting, cloud hosting, web design and development, internet marketing, eCommerce, data storage and backup, and other related services to customers worldwide and manages over 69,000 domain names. While there are many competitors in this space, we believe that NTS is the only technology company with the exclusive focus on the SMB market with products tailored to the specific needs of these business customers.
NTS provides a full suite of outsourced IT infrastructure services, including cloud (virtual) servers, shared server hosting, and dedicated server hosting, under the Newtek® Technology Solutions, Newtek® Web Services and Newtek Web Hosting® brands, for which it receives recurring monthly fees, as well as other fees such as set-up fees, consulting fees, and domain name registration fees, among others. 
Due to the continuing decline in Microsoft being utilized in the design of web sites and the market shift to Linux, Nginx and a proliferation of Word Press sites being built on non-Microsoft based platforms, Microsoft’s new web design growth has decreased to 33% of the market. NTS has responded to this decline by launching Linux Apache and Linux Nginx platforms within its environment and created associated control panels, service/support and billing to participate more fully in 100% of the market. All platforms are available within NTS’ cloud and non-cloud environment and are fully managed offerings as compared to NTS’ competitors. 
NTS has a complete line of cloud-based business and eCommerce packages and Cloud Spaces to streamline the decision process for business owners and accommodate designers and developers that wish to build sites in both Microsoft and Linux environments. Included with this service offering is full customer service with a real human interface available on a 24/7/365 basis, which we believe further distinguishes NTS from its competitors who usually offer co-location hosting without the support needed for the SMB market customer.
NTS currently operates three data centers in Scottsdale, Arizona, Phoenix, Arizona, and Edison, New Jersey. 
The datacenter facilities NTS employs to host its technologies conforms to The Uptime Institute’s 4-Tier Classification System which has become a global standard for third-party validation of data center critical infrastructure. The Tier Classification System defines the requirements and benefits of four distinct Tier classifications for data center infrastructure. Each Tier sets the appropriate criteria for power, cooling, maintenance, and capability to withstand a fault. Tiers are progressive; each Tier incorporates the requirements of all the lower Tiers. NTS operates its critical infrastructure within facilities that have a minimum rating of Tier 3-Certified. NTS datacenters meet and exceed Uptime Institute Tier-3 standards in all categories which allows NTS to pursue and service, compliance-sensitive workloads from the financial services, healthcare, government and military sectors. In addition, NTS includes redundant, carrier-neutral network design for all its communications paths, multiple locations to host services, and a built in DDOS mitigation platform into the design of its datacenter services.
Throughout its affiliation with Newtek, over 70% of new NTS customers have come as a result of internal and external referrals without material expenditures by NTS for marketing or advertising. Many of NTS’ competitors are very price sensitive, offering minimal services at cut-rate pricing. While being cost competitive with most Linux-and Windows-based web hosting services, NTS has emphasized higher quality uptime, service and support as well as multiple control panel environments for the designer and developer community.
NTS has also launched a turnkey hosting service to meet financial institution needs for dedicated servers, hosting and/or data storage, enabling these entities to comply with their strict regulatory requirements that demand very high security protocols and practices be in place.
10

In addition, IPM and SIDCO are wholly-owned portfolio companies which consult, strategize, design, and implement technology solutions for enterprise and commercial clients across the U.S., and are expected to complement the offerings of NTS.
In early 2018, NTS became aware that an unauthorized third party misappropriated three domain names, which NTS used to support customer management of hosted websites. NTS notified its shared webhosting customers of the incident, and assisted in re-routing web traffic to minimize any service disruptions to its clients. 
NTS’ management launched an investigation into the incident and based on the investigation, NTS’ management concluded that attackers compromised a portion of its shared webhosting system, and may have acquired certain customer information limited to its shared webhosting customers, and/or gained access to certain of its shared webhosting servers. NTS has taken a range of steps designed to secure its system, enhance its security protections, enhance access controls, and prevent future unauthorized activity. 
Newtek Insurance Agency (NIA)
NIA is a retail and wholesale brokerage insurance agency licensed in 50 states specializing in the sale of personal, commercial and health/benefits lines insurance products to customers of all of the Newtek portfolio companies as well as Newtek alliance partners. NIA offers insurance products from multiple insurance carriers providing a wide range of choice for its customers. NIA is also implementing programs with alliance partners to market commercial and personal insurance. A major sales channel for NIA is the SMB customer base of our lending platform and the other controlled portfolio companies which allow for many opportunities for cross sales between business lines.
Newtek Payroll and Benefits Solutions (NPS)
NPS offers an array of industry standard and very competitively priced payroll management, benefit, payment and tax reporting services to SMBs. These payroll and benefit solutions are marketed through all of Newtek’s available channels including the alliance partnerships and direct marketing campaigns. NPS also benefits by the access to the SMB customer base of the lending platform and the other controlled portfolio companies.
NPS provides full service payroll and benefit solutions across all industries, processing payroll via software as a service (SaaS) or phone solutions. They have an established and reliable platform that is not limited by client size, industry type or delivery interface. NPS assists clients in managing their payroll processing needs by calculating, collecting and disbursing their payroll funds, remitting payroll taxes and preparing and filing all associated tax returns. In addition, NPS offers clients a range of ancillary service offerings, including workers’ compensation insurance, time and attendance, 401(k) administration, pay cards, employee benefit plans, employee background screening, COBRA services, tax credit recovery, Section 125 and flexible benefits spending plans and expense management services.
Certified Capital Companies (Capcos)
Under state-created Capco programs, states provide a Capco with tax credits generally equal to the amount of funds the Capco raises from insurance company investors. The Capcos then issue the tax credits to its investors — a process which is designed to reduce the Capco’s investors’ state tax liabilities. In exchange for receiving the tax credits, the Capco is obligated to invest the funds raised in certain qualified businesses, which generally are defined by statute to include only businesses that meet certain criteria related to the size, location, number of employees, and other characteristics of the business. If a Capco fails to comply with the performance requirements of each state’s different Capco program, the tax credits are subject to forfeiture.
Under state law, a Capco that has invested in qualified businesses an amount equal to 100% of its initial certified capital is able to decertify (i.e., terminate its status as a Capco) and no longer be subject to any state Capco regulation. Upon voluntary decertification, the programs in about half of the states require that a Capco share any distributions to its equity holders with the state sponsoring the Capco. For those states that require a share of distributions, the sharing percentages vary, but are generally from 10% to 30%, usually on distributions above a specified internal rate of return for the equity owners of the Capco.
Based on the above and that the Capcos were formed to make investments in businesses, the entities were determined to be investment companies and are therefore consolidated subsidiaries of Newtek.
Our Capcos have historically invested in SMBs and, in addition to interest income and investment returns, have generated non-cash income from tax credits and non-cash interest and insurance expenses in addition to cash management fees and expenses. We have de-emphasized our Capco business in favor of growing our controlled portfolio companies and do not anticipate 
11

creating any new Capcos. While observing all requirements of the Capco programs and, in particular, financing qualified businesses meeting applicable state requirements as to limitations on the proportion of ownership of qualified businesses, we believe the growth of our controlled portfolio companies produces a strategic focus on providing goods and services to SMBs such as those in which our Capcos invest. We continue to invest in and lend to SMBs through our existing Capcos and intend to meet the goals of the Capco programs.
As the Capcos reach 100% investment we will seek to decertify them as Capcos, liquidate their remaining assets and thereby reduce their operational costs, particularly the legal and accounting costs associated with compliance. Eleven of our original sixteen Capcos have reached this stage.
Newtek Branding
We have developed our branded line of products and services to offer a full service suite of business and financial solutions for the U.S. SMB market. Newtek reaches potential customers through its integrated multi-channel approach featuring direct, indirect and direct outbound solicitation efforts. We continue to utilize and grow our primary marketing channel of strategic alliance partners as well as a direct marketing strategy to SMB customers through our “go to market” brand, Your Business Solutions Company®. Through a television advertising campaign built around this brand, and our web presence, www.newtekone.com, we believe we are establishing ourselves as a preferred “go-to” provider for SMB financing and the services offered by our controlled portfolio companies. In addition, we supplement these efforts with extensive efforts to present the Company as the authority on small businesses.
We market services through referrals from our strategic alliance partners such as Amalgamated Bank, Banco Popular, Credit Union National Association, E-Insure, ENT Federal Credit Union, The Hartford, Legacy Bank, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Navy Federal Credit Union, New York Community Bank, Raymond James, Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union, UBS , Meineke Dealers Purchasing Cooperative and True Value Company, among others, (using our patented NewTracker® referral management system) as well as direct referrals from our web presence, www.newtekone.com. Our NewTracker® referral system has a software application patent covering the systems and methods for tracking, reporting and performing processing activities and transactions in association with referral data and related information for a variety of product and service offerings in a business-to-business environment. The NewTracker® system provides for transparency between Newtek and referring parties and has been material in our ability to obtain referrals from a wide variety of sources. This patented system allows us and our alliance partners to review in real time the status of any referral as well as to provide real time compliance oversight by the respective alliance partner, which we believe creates confidence among the referred business client, the referring alliance partner and us. We own the NewTracker® patent, as well as all trademarks and other patented intellectual property used by us and our controlled portfolio companies.
Additional referrals are obtained from individual professionals in geographic markets that have signed up to provide referrals and earn commissions through our BizExec and TechExec Programs. Our BizExecs and TechExecs are traditionally information technology professionals, CPAs, independent insurance agents and sales and/or marketing professionals. In addition, electronic payment processing services are marketed through independent sales agents, and web technology and eCommerce services are marketed through internet-based marketing and third-party resellers. A common thread across all business lines of our controlled portfolio companies relates to acquiring customers at low cost and making strategic alliances primarily where we pay fees only for successful referrals. We seek to bundle our marketing efforts through our brand, our portal, our patented NewTracker® referral system, our web presence as Your Business Solutions Company® and one easy entry point of contact. We expect that this approach will allow us to continue to cross-sell the financing services of our business finance platform to customers of our controlled portfolio companies and build upon our extensive deal sourcing infrastructure. The compensation which we pay for referrals is consistent with industry practices.
Senior Lending Team and Executive Committee
The key members of our Senior Lending Team, most of who have worked together for more than ten years each have over 25 years of experience in finance-related fields. These investment professionals have worked together to screen opportunities, underwrite new investments and manage a portfolio of investments in SMBs through two recessions, a credit crunch, the dot-com boom and bust and a historic, leverage-fueled asset valuation bubble. Each member brings a complementary component to a team well-rounded in finance, accounting, operations, strategy, business law and executive management.
Because we are internally managed by our Executive Committee, which includes Barry Sloane, Peter Downs, Jennifer C. Eddelson and Michael A. Schwartz, under the supervision of our Board, and do not depend on a third-party investment advisor, we do not pay investment advisory fees and all of our income is available to pay our operating costs and to make distributions to our shareholders. While our portfolio companies are independently managed, our Executive Committee also oversees our 
12

controlled portfolio companies and, to the extent that we may make additional equity investments in the future, the Executive Committee will also have primary responsibility for the identification, screening, review and completion of such investments. We do not expect to focus our resources on investing in additional stand-alone equity investments, but may elect to do so from time to time on an opportunistic basis, if such opportunities arise. Messrs. Sloane and Downs have been involved together in the structuring and management of equity investments for the past sixteen years.
Market Opportunity
We believe that the limited amount of capital and financial products available to SMBs, coupled with the desire of these companies for flexible and partnership-oriented sources of capital and other financial products, creates an attractive investment environment for us to further expand our business finance platform and overall brand. We believe the following factors will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow and deliver attractive returns to shareholders.
The SMB market represents a large, underserved market.  We estimate the SMB market to include over 27 million businesses in the U.S. We believe that SMBs, most of which are privately-held, are relatively underserved by traditional capital providers such as commercial banks, finance companies, hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation funds. Further, we believe that such companies generally possess conservative capital structures with significant enterprise value cushions, as compared to larger companies with more financing options. While the largest originators of SBA 7(a) loans have traditionally been regional and national banks, from 2012 through 2018, NSBF was the largest non-bank originator of SBA 7(a) loans by dollar lending volume and is currently the fourth largest SBA 7(a) lender in the U.S. As a result, we believe we and our controlled portfolio companies are well positioned to provide financing to the types of SMBs that we have historically targeted and we have the technology and infrastructure in place presently to do it cost effectively in all 50 states and across many industries.
Future refinancing activity is expected to create additional investment opportunities.  A high volume of financings completed between 2005 and 2008 will mature in the coming years. We believe this supply of opportunities coupled with limited financing providers focused on SMBs will continue to offer investment opportunities with attractive risk-weighted returns.
The increased capital requirements and other regulations placed on banks may reduce lending by traditional large financial institutions and community banks.  While many SMBs were previously able to raise debt financing through traditional large financial institutions, we believe this approach to financing will continue to be constrained for several years as continued implementation of U.S. and international financial reforms, such as Basel III, phase in and rules and regulations are promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We believe that these regulations will increase capital requirements and have the effect of further limiting the capacity of traditional financial institutions to hold non-investment grade loans on their balance sheets. As a result, we believe that many of these financial institutions have de-emphasized their service and product offerings to SMBs, which we believe will make a higher volume of deal flow available to us.
Increased demand for comprehensive, business-critical SMB solutions. Increased competition and rapid technological innovation are creating an increasingly competitive business environment that requires SMBs to fundamentally change the way they manage critical business processes. This environment is characterized by greater focus on increased quality, lower costs, faster turnaround and heightened regulatory scrutiny. To make necessary changes and adequately address these needs, we believe that companies are focusing on their core competencies and utilizing cost-effective outsourced solutions to improve productivity, lower costs and manage operations more efficiently. Our controlled portfolio companies provide critical business solutions such as electronic payment processing, managed IT solutions, personal and commercial insurance services and full-service payroll and benefit solutions, receivables financing and funding of SBA 504 loans which provide financing of fixed assets such as real estate or equipment. We believe that each of these market segments are underserved for SMBs and since we are able to provide comprehensive solutions under one platform, we are well positioned to continue to realize growth from these product offerings.
Competitive Advantages
We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of investment opportunities in SMBs due to the following competitive advantages:
Internally Managed Structure and Significant Management Resources. We are internally managed by our executive officers under the supervision of our Board and do not depend on an external investment advisor. As a result, we do not pay investment advisory fees and all of our income is available to pay our operating costs, which include employing investment and portfolio management professionals, and to make distributions to our shareholders. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a lower cost operating expense structure, when compared to other publicly traded and privately-held 
13

investment firms which are externally managed, and allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio. Our senior lending team has developed one of the largest independent loan origination and servicing platforms that focuses exclusively on SMBs.
Business Model Enables Attractive Risk-Weighted Return on Investment in SBA 7(a) Lending.  Our SBA 7(a) loans are structured so as to permit rapid sale of the U.S. government guaranteed portions, often within weeks of origination, and the unguaranteed portions have been successfully securitized and sold, usually within a year of origination. The return of principal and premium may result in an advantageous risk-weighted return on our original investment in each loan. We may determine to retain the government guaranteed or unguaranteed portions of loans pending deployment of excess capital.
State of the Art Technology. Our patented NewTracker® software enables us to board a SMB customer, process the application or inquiry, assemble necessary documents, complete the transaction and create a daily reporting system that is sufficiently unique as to receive a U.S. patent. This system enables us to identify a transaction, similar to a merchandise barcode or the customer management system used by SalesForce.com, then process a business transaction and generate internal reports used by management and external reports for strategic referral partners. It allows our referral partners to have digital access into our back office and follow on a real time, 24/7 basis the processing of their referred customers. This technology has been made applicable to all of the service and product offerings we make directly or through our controlled portfolio companies.
Established Direct Origination Platform with Extensive Deal Sourcing Infrastructure. We have established a direct origination pipeline for investment opportunities without the necessity for investment banks or brokers as well as broad marketing channels that allow for highly selective underwriting. The combination of our brand, our portal, our patented NewTracker® technology, and our web presence as Your Business Solutions Company® have created an extensive deal sourcing infrastructure. Although we pay fees for loan originations that are referred to us by our alliance partners, our investment team works directly with the borrower to assemble and underwrite loans. We rarely invest in pre-assembled loans that are sold by investment banks or brokers. As a result, we believe that our unique national origination platform allows us to originate attractive credits at a low cost. During 2018 we funded $469,176,000 of SBA 7(a) loans, based on the large volume of loan referrals we received in 2018. We anticipate that our principal source of investment opportunities will continue to be in the same types of SMBs to which we currently provide financing. Our Executive Committee and Senior Lending Team will also seek to leverage our extensive network of additional referral sources, including law firms, accounting firms, financial, operational and strategic consultants and financial institutions, with whom we have completed investments. We believe our current infrastructure and expansive relationships will continue to enable us to review a significant amount of high quality, direct (or non-brokered) investment opportunities.
Experienced Senior Lending Team with Proven Track Record.  We believe that our Senior Lending Team is one of the leading capital providers to SMBs. Our Senior Lending Team has expertise in managing the SBA process and has managed a diverse portfolio of investments with a broad geographic and industry mix. While the primary focus of NSBF is to expand its debt financing activities in SBA 7(a) loans, our Senior Lending Team is also focused on growing our business finance platform through our controlled portfolio companies NBC, which provides receivables financing, inventory financing and health care receivables financing, and NBL, which funds SBA 504 loans.
Flexible, Customized Financing Solutions for Seasoned, Smaller Businesses. While NSBF’s primary focus is to expand its lending by activities by providing SBA 7(a) loans to SMBs, we also seek to offer SMBs a variety of attractive financing structures, as well as cost effective and efficient business services, to meet their capital needs through our subsidiaries and controlled portfolio companies. In particular, through our controlled portfolio companies, we offer larger loans, between $5,000,000 and $15,000,000, greater than loans available with the SBA guarantee, but with a higher interest rate to compensate for the increased risk. Unlike many of our competitors, we believe we have the platform to provide a complete package of service and financing options for SMBs, which allows for cross-selling opportunities and improved client retention. We expect that a large portion of our capital will be loaned to companies that need growth capital, acquisition financing or funding to recapitalize or refinance existing debt facilities. Our lending will continue to focus on making loans to SMBs that:

• | have 3 to 10 years of operational history;


• | significant experience in management;


• | credit worthy owners who provide a personal guarantee for our investment;


• | show a strong balance sheet to collateralize our investments; and


• | show sufficient cash flow to be able to service the payments on our investments comfortably.

14

Although we may make investments in start-up businesses, we generally seek to avoid investing in high-risk, early-stage enterprises that are only beginning to develop their market share or build their management and operational infrastructure with limited collateral.
Disciplined Underwriting Policies and Rigorous Portfolio Management.  We pursue rigorous due diligence of all prospective investments originated through our platform. Our senior lending team has developed an extensive underwriting due diligence process, which includes a review of the operational, financial, legal and industry performance and outlook for the prospective investment, including quantitative and qualitative stress tests, review of industry data and consultation with outside experts regarding the creditworthiness of the borrower. These processes continue during the portfolio monitoring process, when we will conduct field examinations, review all compliance certificates and covenants and regularly assess the financial and business conditions and prospects of portfolio companies. In addition, SBL is servicer for commercial, SBA 7(a) and other government guaranteed investments whose exceptional servicing capabilities with compact timelines for loan resolutions and dispositions has attracted various third-party portfolios to these controlled portfolio companies.
Business Development Company Conversion
On October 22, 2014, we effectuated a 1 for 5 reverse stock split to attract institutional investors. On November 12, 2014, in conjunction with the completion of a public offering, we merged with and into Newtek Business Services Corp., a newly-formed Maryland corporation, for the purpose of reincorporating in Maryland and we elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act (the “BDC Conversion”). In connection with our election to be regulated as a BDC, we elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our 2015 tax year, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In connection with our election of RIC status, on October 1, 2015 our Board declared a special dividend of $2.69 per share which was paid partially in cash and partially in our common shares on December 31, 2015.
As a BDC, we are required to meet regulatory tests, including the requirement to invest at least 70% of our gross assets in “qualifying assets.” Qualifying assets generally include debt or equity securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies and cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. In addition, as a BDC, and pursuant to the approval that we received from our shareholders on July 26, 2018, we are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 150% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 66 2/3% of the value of our total assets). See “Regulation.”
As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders. To maintain our RIC tax treatment, we must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any.
Investments
We engage in various investment strategies from time to time in order to achieve our overall investment objectives.
Portfolio Company Characteristics
We have and will continue to target investments in future portfolio companies that generate both current income and capital appreciation. In each case, the following criteria and guidelines are applied to the review of a potential investment however, not all criteria are met in every single investment, nor do we guarantee that all criteria will be met in the investments we will make in the future. We have and will continue to limit our investments to the SMB market.
Experienced Management with Meaningful Investment.  We seek to invest in companies in which senior or key managers have significant company-or industry-level experience and have significant equity ownership. It has been our experience that these experienced managers are more committed to the portfolio company’s success and more likely to manage the company in a manner that protects our debt and equity investments.
Significant Invested Capital.  We believe that the existence of an appropriate amount of equity beneath our debt capital provides valuable support for our investment. In addition, the degree to which the particular investment is a meaningful one for the portfolio company’s owners (and their ability and willingness to invest additional equity capital as and to the extent necessary) are also important considerations.
15

Appropriate Capital Structures.  We seek to invest in portfolio companies that are appropriately capitalized. First, we examine the amount of equity that is being invested by the company’s equity owners to determine whether there is a sufficient capital cushion beneath our invested capital. We also analyze the amount of leverage, and the characteristics of senior debt with lien priority over our senior subordinated debt. A key consideration is a strong balance sheet and sufficient free cash flow to service any debt we may invest.
Strong Competitive Position.  We invest in portfolio companies that have developed strong, defensible product or service offerings within their respective market segment(s). These companies should be well positioned to capitalize on organic and strategic growth opportunities, and should compete in industries with strong fundamentals and meaningful barriers to entry. We further analyze prospective portfolio investments in order to identify competitive advantages within their industry, which may result in superior operating margins or industry-leading growth.
Customer and Supplier Diversification.  We expect to invest in portfolio companies with sufficiently diverse customer and supplier bases. We believe these companies will be better able to endure industry consolidation, economic contraction and increased competition than those that are not sufficiently diversified. However, we also recognize that from time to time, an attractive investment opportunity with some concentration among its customer base or supply chain will present itself. We believe that concentration issues can be evaluated and, in some instances (whether due to supplier or customer product or platform diversification, the existence and quality of long-term agreements with such customers or suppliers or other select factors), mitigated, thus presenting a superior risk-weighted pricing scenario.
Investment Objectives
Debt Investments
We target our debt investments, which are principally made through our business finance platform under the SBA 7(a) program, to produce generally, a coupon rate of prime plus 2.75% which enables us to generate rapid sales of loans in the secondary market historically producing gains and with a yield on investment in excess of 30%. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral along with personal guarantees from portfolio company owners, in many cases collateralized by other assets including real estate. In most cases, our debt investment will be collateralized by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and a first or second lien on assets of guarantors, in both cases primarily real estate. All SBA 7(a) loans are made with personal guarantees from any owner(s) of 20% or more of the portfolio company’s equity. As of December 31, 2018, substantially all of our SBA 7(a) portfolio at fair value consisted of debt investments that were secured by first or second priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company.

• | First Lien Loans. Our first lien loans generally have terms of one to twenty-five years, provide for a variable interest rate, contain no prepayment penalties (however, the SBA will charge the borrower a prepayment fee if the loan has a maturity of 15 or more years and is prepaid during the first three years) and are secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our first lien loans may take many forms, including revolving lines of credit, term loans and acquisition lines of credit.


• | Second Lien Loans. Our second lien loans generally have terms of five to twenty-five years, also primarily provide for a variable interest rate, contain no prepayment penalties (however, the SBA will charge the borrower a prepayment fee if the loan has a maturity of 15 or more years and is prepaid during the first three years) and are secured by a second priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. We typically only take second lien positions on additional collateral where we also have first lien positions on business assets. 


• | Unsecured Loans. We make few unsecured investments, primarily to our controlled portfolio companies, which because of our equity ownership are deemed to be more secure. Typically, these loans are to meet short-term funding needs. 

We typically structure our debt investments to include non-financial covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments have strong protections, including default penalties, information rights and, in some cases, affirmative, negative and financial covenants. 
Equity Investments
While the vast majority of our investments have been structured as debt, we have in the past and expect in the future to make selective equity investments primarily as either strategic investments to enhance the integrated operating platform or, to a lesser degree, under the Capco programs. For investments in our controlled portfolio companies, we focus more on tailoring them to 
16

the long-term growth needs of the companies than to immediate return. Our objective with these companies is to foster the development of the businesses as a part of the integrated operational platform of serving the SMB market, so we may reduce the burden on these companies to enable them to grow faster than they would otherwise as another means of supporting their development and that of the integrated whole.
In Capco investments, we often make debt investments in conjunction with being granted equity in the company in the same class of security as the business owner receives upon funding. We generally seek to structure our equity investments to provide us with minority rights provisions and event-driven put rights. 
Investment Process
The members of our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee are responsible for all aspects of our investment selection process. The discussion below describes our investment procedures. The stages of our investment selection process are as follows:
Loan and Deal Generation/Origination
We believe that the combination of our brand, our portal, our patented NewTracker® technology, and our web presence as Your Business Solutions Company® have created an extensive loan and deal sourcing infrastructure. This is maximized through long-standing and extensive relationships with industry contacts, brokers, commercial and investment bankers, entrepreneurs, services providers (such as lawyers and accountants), as well as current and former clients, portfolio companies and our extensive network of strategic alliance partners. We supplement our relationships by the selective use of television advertising aimed primarily at lending to the SMB market. We believe we have developed a reputation as a knowledgeable and reliable source of capital, providing value-added advice, prompt processing, and management and operations support to our portfolio companies.
We market our loan and investment products and services, and those of our controlled portfolio companies, through referrals from our alliance partners such as Amalgamated Bank, Banco Popular, Credit Union National Association, E-Insure, ENT Federal Credit Union, The Hartford, Legacy Bank, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Navy Federal Credit Union, New York Community Bank, Raymond James, Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union, UBS, Meineke Dealers Purchasing Cooperative and True Value Company, among others using our patented NewTracker® referral system as well as direct referrals from our web presence, www.newtekone.com. The patent for our NewTracker® referral system is a software application patent covering the systems and methods for tracking, reporting and performing processing activities and transactions in association with referral data and related information for a variety of product and service offerings in a business-to-business environment providing further for security and transparency between referring parties. This system allows us and our alliance partners to review in real time the status of any referral as well as to provide real time compliance oversight by the respective alliance partner, which we believe creates confidence between the referred business client, the referring alliance partner and us.
Additional deal sourcing and referrals are obtained from individual professionals in geographic markets that have signed up to provide referrals and earn commissions through our BizExec and TechExec Programs. The BizExecs and TechExecs are traditionally information technology professionals, CPAs, independent insurance agents and sales and/or marketing professionals. In addition, electronic payment processing services are marketed through independent sales representatives and web technology and eCommerce services are marketed through internet-based marketing and third-party resellers. A common thread across all business lines of our subsidiaries and controlled portfolio companies relates to acquiring customers at low cost. We seek to bundle our marketing efforts through our brand, our portal, NewTracker®, our web presence as Your Business Solutions Company® and one easy entry point of contact. We expect that this approach will allow us to continue to cross-sell the financing services of our business finance platform to our customers and customers of our controlled portfolio companies, and to build upon our extensive deal sourcing infrastructure.
Screening
We screen all potential debt or equity investment proposals that we receive for suitability and consistency with our investment criteria (see “Portfolio Company Characteristics,” above). In screening potential investments, our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee utilize a value-oriented investment philosophy and commit resources to managing downside exposure. If a potential investment meets our basic investment criteria, a business service specialist or other member of our team is assigned to perform preliminary due diligence.
17

SBA Lending Procedures
We originate loans under the SBA 7(a) Program in accordance with our credit and underwriting policy, which incorporates by reference the SBA Rules and Regulations as they relate to the financing of such loans, including the U.S. Small Business Administration Standard Operating Procedures, Lender and Development Company Loan Program (“SOP 50 10”).
During the initial application process for a loan originated under the SBA 7(a) Program, a business service specialist assists and guides the applicant through the application process, which begins with the submission of an online form. The online loan processing system collects required information and ensures that all necessary forms are provided to the applicant and filled out. The system conducts two early automatic screenings focused primarily on whether (i) the requested loan is for an eligible purpose, (ii) the requested loan is for an eligible amount and (iii) the applicant is an eligible borrower. If the applicant is eligible to fill out the entire application, the online system pre-qualifies the applicant based on preset credit parameters that meet the standards of Newtek and the SBA.
Once the online form and the application materials have been completed, our underwriting department (the “Underwriting Department”) becomes primarily responsible for reviewing and analyzing the application in order to accurately assess the level of risk being undertaken in making a loan. The Underwriting Department is responsible for assuring that all information necessary to prudently analyze the risk associated with a loan application has been obtained and has been analyzed. Credit files are developed and maintained with the documentation received during the application process in such a manner as to facilitate file review during subsequent developments during the life of the loan.
Required Information
For a loan originated under the SBA 7(a) Program, the primary application document is SBA Form 1919 (Borrower Information Form) (“Form 1919”). Among other things, Form 1919 requires identifying information about the applicant, loan request, indebtedness, the principals, current or previous government financing, and certain other disclosures.
In addition to Form 1919, the following additional information is required:

• | an SBA Form 912 (Statement of Personal History), if question 1, 2, or 3 of Form 1919 is answered affirmatively;


• | an SBA Form 413 (Personal Financial Statement), for all owners of 20% or more (including the assets of the owner’s spouse and any minor children), and proposed guarantors;


• | business financial statements dated within 180 days prior to submission to SBA, consisting of (a) year-end balance sheets for the last three years, including detailed debt schedule, (b) year-end profit & loss (P&L) statements for the last three years, (c) reconciliation of net worth, (d) interim balance sheet, and (e) interim P&L statements;


• | a list of names and addresses of any subsidiaries and affiliates, including concerns in which the applicant holds a controlling interest and other concerns that may be affiliated by stock ownership, franchise, proposed merger or otherwise with the applicant, and business financial statements meeting the same requirements as above of such subsidiaries and affiliates;


• | the applicant’s original business license or certificate of doing business;


• | records of any loans the applicant may have applied for in the past;


• | signed personal and business federal income tax returns of the principals of the applicant’s business for previous three years;


• | personal résumés for each principal;


• | a brief history of the business and its challenges, including an explanation of why the SBA loan is needed and how it will help the business;


• | a copy of the applicant’s business lease, or note from the applicant’s landlord, giving terms of proposed lease; and

18


• | if purchasing an existing business, (a) current balance sheet and P&L statement of business to be purchased, (b) previous two years federal income tax returns of the business, (c) proposed Bill of Sale including Terms of Sale, and (d) asking price with schedule of inventory, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures.

We view current financial information as the foundation of sound credit analysis. To that end, we verify all business income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and generally request that financial statements be submitted on an annual basis after the loan closes. For business entities or business guarantors, we request federal income tax returns for each fiscal year-end to meet the prior three-year submission requirement. For interim periods, we will accept management-prepared financial statements. The most recent financial information may not be more than 180 days old at the time of the approval of the loan, but we generally request that the most recent financial information not be older than 90 days in order to provide time for underwriting and submission to SBA for guaranty approval. For individuals or personal guarantors, we require a personal financial statement dated within 180 days of the application (sixty days is preferred) and personal income tax returns for the prior three years. In connection with each yearly update of business financial information, the personal financial information of each principal must also be updated. Spouses are required to sign all personal financial statements in order for the Underwriting Department to verify compliance with the SBA’s personal resource test. In addition, the Underwriting Department will ensure that there has been no adverse impact on financial condition of the applicant or its principals since the approval of the loan. If closing does not occur within ninety days of the date on which the loan is approved, updated business and personal financial statements must be obtained and any adverse change must be addressed before the proceeds of the loan may be disbursed. If closing does not occur within six months of the date on which the loan is approved, the applicant is generally required to reapply for the loan.
Stress Test
The standard underwriting process requires a stress test on the applicant’s interest rate to gauge the amount of increase that can be withstood by the applicant’s cash flow and still provide sufficient cash to service debt. The applicant’s cash flow is tested up to a 2% increase in interest rate. If the applicant’s debt service coverage ratio decreases to 1:1 or less than 1:1, the loan may only be made as an exception to our Underwriting Guidelines and would require the approval of our credit committee.
Required Site Visit
No loan will be funded without an authorized representative of Newtek first making a site visit to the business premises. We generally use a contracted vendor to make the required site visit but may from time to time send our own employees to perform this function. Each site visit will generate a narrative of the business property as well as photographs of the business property. Additional site visits will be made when a physical on-site inspection is warranted.
Credit Assessment of Applicant
Loan requests are assessed primarily based upon an analysis of the character, cash flow, capital, liquidity and collateral involved in the transaction.
Character:  We require a personal credit report to be obtained on any principal or guarantor involved in a loan transaction. Emphasis is placed upon the importance of individual credit histories, as this is a primary indicator of an individual’s willingness and ability to repay debt. Any material negative credit information must be explained in writing by the principal, and must be attached to the personal credit report in the credit file. No loan will be made where an individual’s credit history calls into question the repayment ability of the business operation. A loan request from an applicant who has declared bankruptcy within the ten years preceding the loan application will require special consideration. A thorough review of the facts behind the bankruptcy and impact on creditors will be undertaken in determining whether the principal has demonstrated the necessary willingness and ability to repay debts. In addition, we will examine whether the applicant and its principals and guarantors have abided by the laws of their community. Any situation where a serious question concerning a principal’s character exists will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Unresolved character issues are grounds for declining a loan request regardless of the applicant’s financial condition or performance.
Cash Flow:  We recognize that cash flow is the primary and desired source of repayment on any loan, and therefore is the primary focus of the credit decision. Any transaction in which the repayment is not reasonably assured through cash flow will be declined, regardless of other possible credit strengths. At a minimum, combined EBITDA will be used to evaluate repayment ability. Other financial analysis techniques will be employed as needed to establish the reasonableness of repayment. Where repayment is based on past experience, the applicant must demonstrate minimum combined cash flow coverage of 1.2 times based upon the most recent fiscal year-end financial statement. A determination of the ability to repay will not be based solely upon interim operating results. Where repayment ability is not evident from historical combined earnings (including new 
19

businesses and changes of ownership), projections will be analyzed to determine whether repayment ability is reasonably assured. For changes in ownership, monthly cash flow forecasts will be analyzed to determine adequacy to meet all of the borrower’s needs.
For business acquisition applications, the applicant will be required to submit projections and support such projections by detailed assumptions made for all major revenue and expense categories and an explanation of how the projections will be met. Analysis must include comparisons with relevant Risk Management Association (“RMA”) industry averages. EBITDA must be reasonably forecast to exceed debt service requirements by at least 1.2 times, after accounting for the initial phase of operations. For change of ownership applications, projections will also be measured against the actual historical financial results of the seller of the business concern. Projections must demonstrate repayment ability of not less than 1.2 times.
Capital:  Capital is a strong traditional indicator of the financial health of a business. For going concern entities, the pro-forma leverage position, as measured by the debt to tangible net worth ratio, may not exceed the RMA industry median or 4 to 1, whichever is greater. For change of ownership transactions, generally 25% of total project costs should be contributed as equity resulting in debt to tangible net worth ratio of 3 to 1.
For a change of ownership transaction where a substantial portion of intangibles are included within the transaction, adequacy of capital will be determined based upon an evaluation of the business value and level of injection. In determining the legitimacy of the business value, the loan underwriter must utilize two SBA approved valuation methods, as outlined in SBA SOP 50 10. If the business value is found to be acceptable, and the equity injection into the project is within our requirements as outlined herein, then the capital position will be considered satisfactory.
As a general rule, shareholder and affiliate loans may be added back to net worth only if such loans will be subordinated for the life of the SBA loan, with no principal or interest payments to be made. Financing by the seller of the business may also be considered as equity if the loan will be placed on full standby for the life of the SBA loan. Adjustments to net worth to account for the difference between the book value and appraised value of fixed assets may be made only when supported by a current appraisal. Appraisals on a “subject to” basis are not acceptable.
Liquidity:  Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, must be in line with the RMA industry average. An assessment of the adequacy of working capital is required. An assessment of the liquidity of a business is essential in determining the ability to meet future obligations. Lending to cash businesses such as hotels and restaurants requires less analysis of the liquidity of the business due to the timing of cash receipts. Industries with large receivables, payables, and inventory accounts require thorough review of the cash cycle of the business and evaluation of the applicant’s ability to manage these accounts. The current and quick ratios and turnover of receivables, payables and inventory are measured against the RMA industry median in determining the adequacy of these liquidity measures.
Collateral.  We are required to reasonably secure each loan transaction with all worthwhile and available assets. Pursuant to SBA SOP 50 10, we may not (and will not) decline a loan if the only weakness in the application is the value of collateral in relation to the loan amount, provided that all assets available to the business and its principals have been pledged. As set forth in SBA SOP 50 10, the SBA considers a loan to be fully secured if the lender has taken a security interest in all available fixed assets with a combined “net book value” adjusted up to the loan amounts below. For 7(a) loans, “fixed assets” means real estate, including land and structures and machinery and equipment owned by the business. “Net book value” is defined as an asset’s original price minus depreciation and amortization.
We attempt to secure each loan transaction with as much real estate and liquid asset collateral as necessary; however, all fixed assets must be evaluated. Fixed assets are evaluated on the basis of the net book value to determine the realizable value among collateral types. Valuation factors are applied as follows:

• | Commercial real estate — 75%


• | Residential real estate — 85%


• | Vacant land — 50%


• | Machinery & Equipment — 50%


• | Furniture & Fixtures — 10%


• | Accounts receivable & inventory — 20%

20


• | Leasehold improvements — 5%


• | Certificate of Deposit — 100%


• | Regulated Licenses — will vary dependent upon type of license and geographic area. The liquidation rate used must be fully justified.

In addition to an assessment of the criteria specified above, there are certain special industry-specific requirements that will be considered in the loan application decision.
Change of Ownership: The minimum equity injection required in a change of ownership transaction is generally 20% but may be lower for specific industries such as medical and dental practices, gas stations and convenience stores, flag hotels and “strong” non-lodging franchises.
In the event of financing from the seller of the business, the applicant must inject not less than 10% of the project cost; the seller of the business may provide the balance on a complete standby basis for the life of the SBA loan. Exceptions to the equity requirement are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
For a change of ownership transaction, the application must be accompanied by a business plan including reasonable financial projections. The financial performance of the seller of the business must be evaluated based upon three years of corporate income tax returns and a current interim financial statement. Projections for the applicant must be in line with the historical financial performance at the business location. In cases where financial performance of the seller of the business is poor, a satisfactory explanation must be provided to detail the circumstances of performance. Projections for the applicant must be accompanied by detailed assumptions and be supported by information contained in the business plan.
Management should have related experience in the industry and demonstrate the ability to successfully operate the business. In the absence of satisfactory related experience, an assessment of management’s experience and capabilities, given the complexity and nature of the business, will be made. In the case of a franchise, we will generally take into account the reputation of a franchisor for providing worthwhile management assistance to its franchisees.
We carefully review change of ownership transactions. The loan underwriter will review the contract for sale, which will be included in the credit file. The contract for sale must include a complete breakdown of the purchase price, which must be justified through either a third party appraisal or directly by the loan underwriter through an approved valuation method specified in SBA SOP 50 10. The contract of sale must evidence an arm’s length transaction (but transactions between related parties are permitted so long as they are on an arm’s-length basis) which will preserve the existence of the small business or promote its sound development. In addition, a satisfactory reason for the sale of the business must be provided. The seller of the business must provide the prior three years of business tax returns and a current interim financial statement, as applicable.
Also, in connection with a change of ownership transaction, the Loan Processing area of the Underwriting Department will order Uniform Commercial Code searches on the seller of the existing business. If such a search identifies any adverse information, the Loan Processor will advise the Underwriting Manager or Operations Manager so a prudent decision may be made with respect to the application.
Real Estate Transactions:  Loan proceeds for the acquisition or refinancing of land or an existing building or for renovation or reconstruction of an existing building must meet the following criteria:

• | the property must be at least 51% owner-occupied pursuant to SBA policies; and


• | loan proceeds may not be used to remodel or convert any rental space in the property.

Loan proceeds for construction or refinancing of construction of a new building must meet the following criteria:

• | the property must be at least 60% owner-occupied pursuant to SBA policies; and


• | if the building is larger than current requirements of the applicant, projections must demonstrate that the applicant will need additional space within three years, and will use all of the additional space within ten years.

21

Commercial real estate appraisals are required on all primary collateral prior to the loan closing. In general, appraisals will be required as follows:

• | for loans up to $100,000 — a formal opinion of value prepared by a real estate professional with knowledge of the local market area;


• | for loans from $100,000 to $500,000 — a limited summary appraisal completed by a state certified appraiser;


• | for loans from $500,000 to $1 million — a limited summary appraisal by a Member of the Appraisal Institute (“MAI”) appraiser; and


• | for loans over $1 million — a complete self-contained appraisal by a MAI appraiser.

Environmental screenings and an environmental questionnaire are required for all commercial real estate taken as collateral.
In general, environmental reports are required as follows:

• | for real estate valued up to $500,000 — a transaction screen including a records review;


• | for real estate valued in excess of $500,000 — a Phase I Environmental Report; and


• | for the following types of property, a Phase I Environmental Report will be required regardless of property value: gasoline service stations, car washes, dry cleaners and any other business known to be in environmentally polluting industries.

In all cases for commercial real estate taken as collateral:

• | if further testing is recommended, the recommended level of testing will be performed prior to the loan closing; and


• | if the report indicates remedial action to be taken by the business, such actions must be completed prior to the loan closing and a closure letter must be provided prior to funding.

Medical Professionals:  In connection with a loan application relating to the financing of a medical business, all medical licenses will be verified, with the loss or non-renewal of license constituting grounds for denial of the application. In addition, medical professionals must provide evidence of malpractice liability insurance of at least $2,000,000 or the loan amount, whichever is higher. Malpractice insurance must be maintained for the life of the loan.
Franchise Lending:  All franchise loan applications will be evaluated as to eligibility by accessing SBA’s Franchise Registry. If the franchise is listed in the registry and the current franchise agreement is the same as the agreement listed in the registry, Newtek will not review the franchise agreement. However, the franchise agreement will be reviewed for eligibility by the loan underwriter when either of the following applies: (i) the franchise is not listed on the SBA’s Franchise Registry or (ii) the franchise is on the registry, but the franchisor has not provided a “Certification of No Change on Behalf of a Registered Franchisor” or a “Certification of Changes on Behalf of a Registered Franchisor.”
Credit Package
For each loan application, the loan underwriter will prepare a credit package (the “Credit Package”). All credit and collateral issues are addressed in the Credit Package, including but not limited to, the terms and conditions of the loan request, use of proceeds, collateral adequacy, financial condition of the applicant and business, management strength, repayment ability and conditions precedent. The Underwriting Department will recommend approval, denial or modification of the loan application. The Credit Package is submitted to our credit committee for further review and final decision regarding the loan application.
Other than rejections for ineligibility of the applicant, the type of business or the loan purpose, NSBF may decline a loan application for the following reasons:

• | after taking into consideration prior liens and considered along with other credit factors, the net value of the collateral offered as security is not sufficient to protect the interest of the U.S. Government;


• | lack of reasonable assurance of ability to repay loan (and other obligations) from earnings;

22


• | lack of reasonable assurance that the business can be operated at a rate of profit sufficient to repay the loan (and other obligations) from earnings;


• | disproportion of loan requested and of debts to tangible net worth before and after the loan;


• | inadequate working capital after the disbursement of the loan;


• | the result of granting the financial assistance requested would be to replenish funds distributed to the owners, partners, or shareholders;


• | lack of satisfactory evidence that the funds required are not obtainable without undue hardship through utilization of personal credit or resources of the owner, partners or shareholders;


• | the major portion of the loan requested would be to refinance existing indebtedness presently financed through normal lending channels;


• | credit commensurate with applicant’s tangible net worth is already being provided on terms considered reasonable;


• | gross disproportion between owner’s actual investment and the loan requested;


• | lack of reasonable assurance that applicant will comply with the terms of the loan agreement;


• | unsatisfactory experience on an existing loan; or


• | economic or physical injury not substantiated.

If a loan application is accepted, we will issue a commitment letter to the applicant. After approval, the SBA and NSBF enter into a Loan Authorization Agreement which sets forth the terms and conditions for the SBA’s guaranty on the loan. The closing of a loan is handled by an internal attorney, whose primary responsibility is closing the loan in accordance with the related Loan Authorization in a manner consistent with prudent commercial loan closing procedures, to ensure that the SBA will not repudiate its guaranty due to ineligibility, noncompliance with SBA Rules and Regulations or defective documentation. Before loan proceeds are disbursed, the closing attorney will verify the applicant’s required capital injection, ensure that proceeds are being used for a permitted purpose and ensure that other requirements of the Loan Authorization Agreement (including, but not limited to, required insurance and lien positions and environmental considerations) and SBA Rules and Regulations (including the use of proper SBA forms) have been met.
Maintenance of Credit Files
A credit file is developed on each borrowing account. Credit files, in either hard copy format or electronic copy, are maintained by the Underwriting Department and organized according to a specified format. The file contains all documentation necessary to show: (a) the basis of the loan, (b) purpose, compliance with policy, conditions, rate, terms of repayment, collateral, and (c) the authority for granting the loan. The credit file is subject to review or audit by the SBA at any time. Upon final action being taken on a loan application, information necessary for closing and servicing will be copied and maintained, while information not considered necessary will be transferred to off-site storage. Once a loan has been disbursed in full, credit files containing all documentation will be transferred to the file room or other electronic storage media and maintained under the authority of the administration staff. Any individual needing an existing credit file must obtain it from the administration staff member having responsibility for safeguarding all credit files or access it by a prearranged electronic file process. Removal of any information from the file will compromise the credit file and is prohibited.
Other, Primarily Equity Investments
Due Diligence and Underwriting
In making loans or equity investments other than SBA 7(a) loans or similar conventional loans to SMBs, our Executive Committee will take a direct role in screening potential loans or investments, in supervising the due diligence process, in the preparation of deal documentation and the completion of the transactions. The members of the Executive Committee and/or Senior Lending Team complete due diligence and analyze the relationships among the prospective portfolio company’s 
23

business plan, operations and expected financial performance. Due diligence may address some or all of the following depending on the size and nature of the proposed investment:

• | on-site visits with management and relevant key employees;


• | in-depth review of historical and projected financial statements, including covenant calculation work sheets;


• | interviews with customers and suppliers;


• | management background checks;


• | review reports by third-party accountants, outside counsel and other industry, operational or financial experts; and/or


• | review material contracts.

During the underwriting process, significant, ongoing attention is devoted to sensitivity analyses regarding whether a company might bear a significant “downside” case and remain profitable and in compliance with assumed financial covenants. These “downside” scenarios typically involve assumptions regarding the loss of key customers and/or suppliers, an economic downturn, adverse regulatory changes and other relevant stressors that we attempt to simulate in our quantitative and qualitative analyses. Further, we continually examine the effect of these scenarios on financial ratios and other metrics.
Approval, Documentation and Closing
Upon the completion of the due diligence process, the Executive Committee will review the results and determine if the transaction should proceed to approval. If approved by our Senior Lending Team and Executive Committee, the underwriting professionals heretofore involved proceed to documentation.
As and to the extent necessary, key documentation challenges are brought before our Senior Lending Team and Executive Committee for prompt discussion and resolution. Upon the completion of satisfactory documentation and the satisfaction of closing conditions, final approval is sought from our Executive Committee before closing and funding.
Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies
Monitoring, Managerial Assistance
We have and will continue to monitor our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. We monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. We generally require our portfolio companies to provide annual audits, quarterly unaudited financial statements with management discussion and analysis and covenant compliance certificates, and monthly unaudited financial statements. Using these monthly financial statements, we calculate and evaluate all financial covenants and additional financial coverage ratios that might not be part of our covenant package in the loan documents. For purposes of analyzing a portfolio company’s financial performance, we sometimes adjust their financial statements to reflect pro-forma results in the event of a recent change of control, sale, acquisition or anticipated cost savings. Additionally, we believe that, through our integrated marketing and sale of each service line of NSBF and our controlled portfolio companies to our controlled portfolio companies (including electronic payment processing services through NMS, technology solutions through NTS, insurance solutions through NIA and payroll and benefits services through NPS) and non-affiliate portfolio companies, we have in place extensive and robust monitoring capabilities.
We have several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, including the following:

• | assessment of success in adhering to each portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;


• | periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;


• | comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any;


• | attendance at and participation in board meetings; and/or

24


• | review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.

As part of our valuation procedures, we risk rate all of our investments including loans. In general, our rating system uses a scale of 1 to 8, with 1 being the lowest probability of default and principal loss. Our internal rating is not an exact system, but is used internally to estimate the probability of: (i) default on our debt securities and (ii) loss of our debt or investment principal, in the event of a default. In general, our internal rating system may also assist our valuation team in its determination of the estimated fair value of equity securities or equity-like securities. Our internal risk rating system generally encompasses both qualitative and quantitative aspects of our portfolio companies.
Our internal loan and investment risk rating system incorporates the following eight categories:
25


Rating | Summary Description 
1 | Acceptable — Highest Quality — Loans or investments that exhibit strong financial condition and repayment capacity supported by adequate financial information. Generally, as loans these credits are well secured by marketable collateral. These credits are current and have not demonstrated a history of late-pay or delinquency. There are no or few credit administration weaknesses. This score represents a combination of a strong acceptable credit and adequate or better credit administration. Newly underwritten loans or investments may be rated in this category if they clearly possess above-average attributes in all of the above areas. In general, as investments these credits are performing within our internal expectations, and potential risks to the applicable investment are considered to be neutral or favorable compared to any potential risks at the time of the original investment. 
2 | Acceptable — Average Quality — These loans or investments are supported by financial condition and repayment strengths that offset marginal weaknesses. Generally, as loans these credits are secured but may be less than fully secured. These loans are current or less than 30 days past due and may or may not have a history of late payments. They may contain non-material credit administration weaknesses or errors in verifying that do not put the guaranty at risk or cause wrong or poor credit decisions to be made. This risk rating should also be used to assign an initial risk rating to loans or investments that are recommended for approval by underwriting. Without a performance history and/or identified credit administration deficiencies, emphasis should be placed on meeting or exceeding underwriting standards collateral protection, industry experience, and guarantor strength. It is expected that most of our underwritten loans will be of this quality.
3 | Acceptable — Below Average — These loans or investments are the low-end range of acceptable. Loans would be less than fully secured and probably have a history of late pay and/or delinquency, though not severe. They contain one or more credit administration weaknesses that do not put the guaranty at risk or cause wrong or poor credit decisions to be made. This risk rating may also be used to identify new loans or investments that may not meet or exceed all underwriting standards, but are approved because of offsetting strengths in other areas. These credits, while of acceptable quality, typically do not possess the same strengths as those in the 1 or 2 categories. In general, the investment may be performing below internal expectations and quantitative or qualitative risks may have increased materially since the date of the investment. 
4 | Other Assets Especially Mentioned (OAEM or Special Mention) — Strong — These loans or investments are currently protected by sound worth and cash flow or other paying capacity, but exhibit a potentially higher risk situation than acceptable credits. While there is an undue or unwarranted credit risk, it is not yet to the point of justifying a substandard classification. Generally, these loans demonstrate some delinquency history and contain credit administration weaknesses. Performance may show signs of slippage, but can still be corrected. Credit does not require a specific allowance at this point but a risk of loss is present. 
5 | Substandard — Workout — These assets contain well defined weaknesses and are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower. Generally, loan collateral protects to a significant extent. There is a possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and secondary sources may have to be used to repay credit. Credit administration can range from very good to adequate indicating one or more oversights, errors, or omissions which are considered significant but not seriously misleading or causing an error in the loan decision. Performance has slipped and there are well-defined weaknesses. A specific allowance is in order or risk of loss is present. 
6 | Substandard — Liquidation — These assets contain well defined weaknesses and are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or investee. In addition, the weaknesses are so severe that resurrection of the credit is unlikely. For loans, secondary sources will have to be used for repayment. Credits in this category would be severely stressed, nonperforming, and the business may be non-viable. There could be character and significant credit administration issues as well. A specific allowance should be established or the lack of one clearly justified. 
7 | Doubtful — This classification contains all of the weaknesses inherent in a substandard classification but with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or repayment of principal in full, on the basis of existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The probability of loss is very high, but the exact amount may not be estimable at the current point in time. Loans in this category are severely stressed, generally non-performing and/or involve a non-viable operation. Collateral may be difficult to value because of limited salability, no ready and available market, or unknown location or condition of the collateral. Credit administration weaknesses can range from few to severe and may jeopardize the credit as well as the guaranty. All such loans or investments should have a specific allowance. 
8 | Loss — Loans or investments classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is no longer warranted. This classification does not mean that the credit has no recovery or salvage value but, rather, it is not practical to defer writing off this asset. It is also possible that the credit decision cannot be supported by the credit administration process. Documents and verification are lacking; analysis is poor or undocumented, there is no assurance that the loan is eligible or that a correct credit decision was made. Loss loans are loans where a loss total can be clearly estimated. Losses should be taken during the period in which they are identified. 

We will monitor and, when appropriate, change the investment ratings assigned to each loan or investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, our management will review these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and our 
26

Board will affirm such ratings. The investment rating of a particular investment should not, however, be deemed to be a guarantee of the investment’s future performance.
Historically, we have offered to provide significant operating and managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and have provided significant operating and managerial assistance to our controlled portfolio companies. As a BDC, we will continue to offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance will typically involve, among other things, monitoring the operations and financial performance of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial assistance. We may sometimes receive fees for these services.
Valuation Procedures
We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value shall be determined, at all times consistent with GAAP and the 1940 Act. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below:
Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange shall be valued at such price as of the closing price on the day of valuation. We may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we will determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined adequate, we will use the quote obtained. We also employ independent third-party valuation firms for certain of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value.
Securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of our Board, does not represent fair value, which we expect will represent a substantial majority of the investments in our portfolio, shall be valued as follows: (i) each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our Senior Lending Team and Executive Committee; (iii) independent third-party valuation firms engaged by, or on behalf of, the Board will conduct independent appraisals, review management’s preliminary valuations and prepare separate preliminary valuation conclusions on a selected basis; (iv) the Board reviews the preliminary valuations of members of our Senior Lending Team and Executive Committee and/or that of the third-party valuation firm and responds to the valuation recommendation with comments, if any; and (v) the Board will discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.
Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements will refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements.
The determination of fair value will generally be based on the following factors, as relevant:

• | the nature and realizable value of any collateral;


• | adherence to the portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;


• | periodic and regular contact with the portfolio company’s management to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;


• | comparison to portfolio companies in the same industry, if any;


• | the portfolio company’s ability to make payments;


• | the portfolio company’s earnings and discounted cash flow;


• | the markets in which the portfolio company does business; and


• | comparisons to publicly traded securities.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which a pricing source is not sufficient may include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | private placements and restricted securities that do not have an active trading market;

27


• | securities whose trading has been suspended or for which market quotes are no longer available;


• | debt securities that have recently gone into default and for which there is no current market;


• | securities whose prices are stale;


• | securities affected by significant events; and


• | securities that our investment professionals believe were priced incorrectly.

Competition
We compete for SBA 7(a) and other SMB loans with other financial institutions and various SMB lenders, as well as other sources of funding. Additionally, competition for investment opportunities has emerged among alternative investment vehicles, such as collateralized loan obligations, some of which are sponsored by other alternative asset investors, as these entities have begun to focus on making investments in SMBs. As a result of these new entrants, competition for our investment opportunities may intensify. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do but we believe that they invariably lack the ability to process loans as quickly as we can and do not have the depth of our customer service capabilities. We believe we will be able to compete with these entities primarily on the basis of our financial technology infrastructure, our experience and reputation, our deep industry knowledge and ability to provide customized business solutions, our willingness to make smaller investments than other specialty finance companies, the breadth of our contacts, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, and the investment terms we offer.
We and our controlled portfolio companies compete in a large number of markets for the sale of financial and other services to SMBs. Each of our controlled portfolio companies competes not only against suppliers in its particular state or region of the country but also against suppliers operating on a national or even a multi-national scale. None of the markets in which our controlled portfolio companies compete are dominated by a small number of companies that could materially alter the terms of the competition.
Our electronic payment processing portfolio companies compete with entities including Global Payments, First National Bank of Omaha and Paymentech, L.P. Our managed technology solutions portfolio company competes with 1&1, Hosting.com, Discount ASP, Maxum ASP, GoDaddy®, Yahoo!®, BlueHost®, iPowerWeb® and Microsoft among others.
Our business finance platform competes with regional and national banks and non-bank lenders. Intuit® is bundling electronic payment processing, web hosting and payroll services similar to ours in offerings that compete in the same SMB market.
In many cases, we believe that our competitors are not as able as we are to take advantage of changes in business practices due to technological developments and, for those with a larger size, are unable to offer the personalized service that many SMB owners and operators desire.
While we compete with many different providers in our various businesses, we have been unable to identify any direct and comprehensive competitors that deliver the same broad suite of services focused on the needs of the SMB market with the same marketing strategy as we do. We believe that some of the competitive advantages of our platform include:

• | compatible products such as our e-commerce offerings that we are able to bundle to increase sales, reduce costs and reduce risks for our customers and enable us to sell two, three, or four products at the same time;


• | the patented NewTracker® referral system, which allows us and our portfolio companies to process new business utilizing a web-based, centralized processing point and provides back end scalability, and allows our alliance partners to offer a centralized access point for their SMB clients as part of their larger strategic approach to marketing, thus demonstrating their focus on providing a suite of services to the SMB market in addition to their core service;


• | the focus on developing and marketing business solutions and financial products and services aimed at the SMB market;


• | scalability, which allows us to size our business solutions capabilities very quickly to meet customer and market needs;

28


• | the ability to offer personalized service and competitive rates;


• | a strategy of multiple channel distribution, which gives us maximum exposure in the marketplace;


• | high quality customer service 24/7/365 across all business lines, with a focus primarily on absolute customer service and;


• | a telephonic interview process, as opposed to requiring handwritten or data-typing processes, which allows us to offer high levels of customer service and satisfaction, particularly for SMB owners who do not get this service from our competitors

Revenues by Geographic Area
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, all of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 175 employees.
Available Information
We are subject to the informational requirements of the SEC and in accordance with those requirements file reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a web site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC. The address of the SEC’s web site is http://www.sec.gov. Our principal offices are located at 1981 Marcus Avenue, Suite 130, Lake Success, NY 11042 and our telephone number is (212) 356-9500. Our website may be directly accessed at http://www.newtekone.com. We make available through our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. These documents may be directly accessed at http://investor.newtekbusinessservices.com. Information contained on our website is not a part of this report.
Regulation

We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We have also elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act.
In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by “a majority of our outstanding voting securities” as defined in the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
We generally are not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, issue and sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if (1) our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and (2) our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making such sales within the preceding 12 months. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities. At our Special Meeting of Stockholders on July 26, 2018, our stockholders approved a proposal authorizing us to sell up to 20% of our outstanding common stock at a price below our then-current net asset value per share, subject to approval by our Board for the offering. The authorization expires on the earlier of July 26, 2019 or the date of our 2019 Annual Meeting of stockholders. During 2018, the Company did not sell any shares of its common stock at a price below then-current net asset value per share.
29

As a BDC, and pursuant to the approval that we received from our shareholders on July 26, 2018, we are required to not exceed an asset coverage ratio, reflecting the value of our total assets to our total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock issued by us, under the 1940 Act. Prior to March 23, 2018, Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act (which incorporates the requirements of Sections 18(a)(1) and 18(a)(2) of the 1940 Act) did not permit a BDC to issue senior securities unless, at the time of issuance, the BDC had an asset coverage ratio of at least 200%, taking into account that issuance of senior securities (the “Asset Coverage Ratio”). However, on March 23, 2018, the President signed the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCA”) into law. The SBCA, among other things, permits BDCs to be subject to a minimum Asset Coverage Ratio of 150% (the “150% Asset Coverage”), if specific conditions are satisfied, when issuing senior securities. In other words, prior to the enactment of the SBCA, a BDC could borrow $1 for investment purposes for every $1 of investor equity. On April 27, 2018, our Board, including a majority of the non-interested directors who have no financial interest in this proposal, deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders for the Company to be subject to 150% Asset Coverage. As a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior securities were to change from 200% to 150%, effective April 27, 2019. However, as a result of the stockholder approval of Proposal 2 at the July 26, 2018 Special Meeting of stockholders, effective July 27, 2018, the asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act applicable to the Company was decreased from 200% to 150%, permitting the Company to incur additional leverage. Therefore, we are required to meet an Asset Coverage Ratio of the value of total assets to senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, of at least 150%. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. See “Regulation.”
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act. We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might indirectly subject our stockholders to additional expenses as they will indirectly be responsible for the costs and expenses of such companies. None of our investment policies are fundamental and any may be changed without stockholder approval.
Exemptive Relief
On May 10, 2016, we received an order from the SEC for exemptive relief that, with the shareholders’ approval we received on July 27, 2016, allows us to take certain actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the 1940 Act, as applicable to BDCs. Specifically, the order permits us to (i) issue restricted stock awards to our officers, employees and employee and non-employee directors, (ii) issue stock options to our employees, (iii) withhold shares of the Company’s common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of restricted stock or the exercise of options that were granted to pursuant to the 2014 Plan or the Amended Stock Plan, and (iv) permit participants to pay the exercise price of Options that were granted to them pursuant to the 2014 Plan or will be granted to them pursuant to Amended Stock Plan with shares of Applicant’s common stock.
Qualifying Assets 
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following:

(1) | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:

(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
30

(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act: and
(c) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or if it has securities listed on a national securities exchange such company has market capitalization of less than $250 million; is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of a BDC on its board of directors; or meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC.

(2) | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.


(3) | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.


(4) | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (3) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.


(5) | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.

Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company.
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company (as defined in the 1940 Act), invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one such investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of such investment companies in the aggregate. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of our investment policies are fundamental and any may be changed without stockholder approval. 
Significant Managerial Assistance
A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “Qualifying Assets” above. Business development companies generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments 
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we invest in highly rated commercial paper, U.S. Government agency notes, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements relating to such securities that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. Consequently, repurchase agreements are functionally similar to loans. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, the 1940 Act and certain diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes typically require us to limit the amount we invest with any one counterparty. Our investment Advisor monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
31

Warrants and Options
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the amount of warrants, options, restricted stock or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years, (ii) the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii) our stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and our board of directors approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and (iv) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, as well as options and rights, at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock.
Senior Securities; Coverage Ratio 
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if we meet certain asset coverage requirements. On April 27, 2018, we announced that our Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act”) of the Board, approved a proposal to reduce our asset coverage requirement as set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, from 200% to 150%, pursuant to recent modifications included in the Small Business Credit Availability Act. Such change would have been effective April 27, 2019. However, on July 26, 2018, our stockholders approved a proposal to reduce our asset coverage requirement to 150%, effective July 27, 2018. In addition, we may not be permitted to declare any cash dividend or other distribution on our outstanding common shares, or purchase any such shares, unless, at the time of such declaration or purchase, we have asset coverage of at least 150% after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution, or purchase price. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes. For a discussion of the risks associated with the resulting leverage, see “Risk Factors -  Risks Related to Our Business And Structure - Because we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.” For a discussion of the risks associated with the resulting leverage, see “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business Structure - Because we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.”
As of December 31, 2018, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior securities outstanding of $337,501,000 and our asset coverage ratio was 185%.
Issuance of Shares Below Current Net Asset Value
At a Special Meeting of Stockholders on July 26, 2018, our common stockholders approved a proposal that allows us to issue common stock at a discount from our NAV per share, effective for a period expiring on the earlier of July 26, 2019 or the 2019 annual meeting of our stockholders. We have agreed to limit the number of shares that we issue at a price below NAV pursuant to this authorization so that the aggregate dilutive effect on our then outstanding shares will not exceed 20%. Our Board, subject to its fiduciary duties and regulatory requirements, has the discretion to determine the amount of the discount, and as a result, the discount could be up to 100% of net asset value per share. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not sell any shares of common stock at a price below NAV per share. 
Code of Ethics 
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Our code of ethics generally does not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. The code of ethics is published and available on the Company’s website at http://investor.newtekbusinessservices.com/corporate-governance is attached as an exhibit and is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC’s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

Compliance Policies and Procedures
We have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. Mr. Michael Schwartz currently serves as our Chief Compliance Officer.
Privacy Principles
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our shareholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our shareholders, although certain non-public personal information of our shareholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our shareholders or former shareholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service shareholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent).
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the 1934 Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer must certify the accuracy of the consolidated financial statements contained in our periodic reports;


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting; and


• | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in a manner in which we believe is in the best interest of our stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although we generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
Our proxy voting decisions are made by our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee, which are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Stockholders may obtain information regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for information to: Chief Compliance Officer, 1981 Marcus Avenue, Suite 130, Lake Success, NY 11042.
33

Other 
We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
We are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have designated Michael Schwartz to be our Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
Nasdaq Global Market Requirements 
We have adopted certain policies and procedures intended to comply with the Nasdaq Global Market’s corporate governance rules. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards that are approved by the SEC and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
Regulation as a Small Business Lending Company
Our wholly owned subsidiary, NSBF, is licensed by the SBA as an SBLC that originates loans through the SBA 7(a) Program. The SBA 7(a) Program is the SBA’s primary loan program. In order to operate as an SBLC, a licensee is required to maintain a minimum regulatory capital (as defined by SBA regulations) of the greater of (1) 10% of its outstanding loans receivable and other investments or (2) $1,000,000. In addition, a SBLC is subject to certain other regulatory restrictions.
The SBA generally reduces risks to lenders by guaranteeing major portions of qualified loans made to small businesses. This enables lenders to provide financing to small businesses when funding may otherwise be unavailable or not available on reasonable terms. Under the SBA 7(a) Program, the SBA typically guarantees 75% of qualified loans over $150,000. The eligibility requirements of the SBA 7(a) Program vary by the industry of the borrower and affiliates and other factors.
The SBA grants PLP status to certain lenders originating SBA 7(a) loans based on achievement of certain standards in lending which are regularly monitored by the SBA. NSBF has been granted national PLP status and originates, sells and services SBA 7(a) loans. As a Preferred Lender, NSBF is authorized to place SBA guarantees on SBA 7(a) loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Designated PLP lenders are delegated the authority to process, close, service, and liquidate most SBA guaranteed loans without prior SBA review. PLP lenders are authorized to make SBA guaranteed loans, subject only to a brief eligibility review and assignment of a loan number by SBA. In addition, they are expected to handle servicing and liquidation of all of their SBA loans with limited involvement of SBA.
Among other things, SBLCs are required to: submit to the SBA for review a credit policy that demonstrates the SBLC’s compliance with the applicable regulations and the SBA’s Standard Operating Procedures for origination, servicing and liquidation of 7(a) loans; submit to the SBA for review and approval annual validation, with supporting documentation and methodologies, demonstrating that any scoring model used by the SBLC is predictive of loan performance; obtain SBA approval for loan securitization and borrowings; and adopt and fully implement an internal control policy which provides adequate direction for effective control over and accountability for operations, programs, and resources.
Pursuant to the SBA’s regulations, the SBA is released from liability on its guaranty of a 7(a) loan and may, in its sole discretion, refuse to honor a guaranty purchase request in full or in part, or recover all or part of the funds already paid in connection with a guaranty purchase, if the lender failed to comply materially with a program requirement; failed to make, close, service or liquidate the loan in a prudent manner; placed the SBA at risk through improper action or inaction; failed to disclose a material fact to the SBA in a timely manner; or misrepresented a material fact to the SBA regarding the loan. In certain instances, the SBA may refuse to honor a guaranty purchase request in full (referred to by the SBA as a “denial”) or in part (referred to by the SBA as a “repair”), or recover all or part of the funds already paid in connection with a guaranty purchase. In the event of a repair or denial, liability on the guaranty, in whole or part, would be transferred to NSBF.
The SBA restricts the ability of an SBLC to lend money to any of its officers, directors and employees or to invest in associates thereof. The SBA also prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a “change of control” of an SBLC. A “change of control” is any 
34

event which would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of a SBLC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements or otherwise. SBLCs are periodically examined and audited by the SBA to determine compliance with SBA regulations.
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 
For any taxable year in which we: 

• | qualify as a RIC; and


• | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,

We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no corporate-level income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). We generally will endeavor in each taxable year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings.
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

• | continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”); and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:


• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).

Qualified earnings may exclude such income as management fees received in connection with our subsidiaries or other potential outside managed funds and certain other fees. 
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock, or certain income with respect to equity investments in foreign corporations. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. The Company does not currently hold investments that have original issue discount.
Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
35

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level federal income tax.
In addition, we will be partially dependent on our subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Some of our subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and SBA regulations, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our status as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA’s restrictions for our subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If our subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may cause us to fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level federal income tax.
The remainder of this discussion assumes that we will qualify as a RIC and will have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Any transactions in options, futures contracts, constructive sales, hedging, straddle, conversion or similar transactions, and forward contracts will be subject to special tax rules, the effect of which may be to accelerate income to us, defer losses, cause adjustments to the holding periods of our investments, convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains, convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses or have other tax consequences. These rules could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. We do not currently intend to engage in these types of transactions.
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income (e.g., as the result of large amounts of equity-based compensation), we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions.
Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty are often as high as 35% or more. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on this related income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not now known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as paid by its stockholders.
If we purchase shares in a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Code, or QEF, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to it. Alternatively, we can elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. In addition, under recently proposed regulations, income required to be included as a result of a QEF election would not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test unless we receive a distribution of such income from the PFIC in the 
36

same taxable year to which the inclusion relates. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in PFICs to minimize our liability for any taxes and related interest charges.
Foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving non-dollar debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our stockholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of “qualifying income” from which a RIC must derive at least 90% of its annual gross income.
Failure to Qualify as a RIC

If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets).

If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate for non-corporate taxpayers provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. Generally, a non-taxable return of capital will reduce an investor’s basis in our stock for federal tax purposes, which will result in higher tax liability when the stock is sold. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. Certain written disclosure will present a calculation of return of capital on a tax accounting basis. 
To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent 5 years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
