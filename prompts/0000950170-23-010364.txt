 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 BIOLASE, Inc. (“BIOLASE” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a leading provider of advanced laser systems for the dental industry. We develop, manufacture, market, and sell laser systems that provide significant benefits for dental practitioners and their patients. Our proprietary systems allow dentists, periodontists, endodontists, pediatric dentists, oral surgeons, and other dental specialists to perform a broad range of minimally invasive dental procedures, including cosmetic, restorative, and complex surgical applications. Our laser systems are designed to provide clinically superior results for many types of dental procedures compared to those achieved with drills, scalpels, and other conventional instruments. Potential patient benefits include less pain, fewer shots, faster healing, decreased fear and anxiety, and fewer appointments. Potential practitioner benefits include improved patient care and the ability to perform a higher volume, and wider variety of procedures.
 We offer two categories of laser system products: Waterlase (all-tissue) systems and diode (soft-tissue) systems. Our flagship brand, the Waterlase, uses a patented combination of water and laser energy and is FDA cleared for over 80 clinical indications to perform most procedures currently performed using drills, scalpels, and other traditional dental instruments for cutting soft and hard tissue. For example, Waterlase safely debrides implants without damaging or significantly affecting surface temperature and is an effective, safe solution for preserving sick implants. In addition, Waterlase disinfects root canals more efficiently than some traditional chemical methods. We offer our diode laser systems to perform soft tissue, pain therapy, and cosmetic procedures, including teeth whitening. As of December 31, 2022, we maintained approximately 259 active and 24 pending United States and international patents, with the majority relating to our Waterlase technology. Our patent portfolio is regularly evaluated, and we strategically prioritize our core patents to ensure optimal Intellectual Property coverage while minimizing annual maintenance fees. From 1998 through December 31, 2022, we have sold over 45,500 laser systems in over 80 countries around the world, and we believe that Waterlase iPlus is the world’s best-selling all-tissue dental laser. Since 1998, we have been the global leading innovator, manufacturer, and marketer of dental laser systems.
We also manufacture and sell consumable products and accessories for our laser systems. Our Waterlase and diode systems use disposable laser tips of differing sizes and shapes depending on the procedure being performed. We also market flexible fibers and hand pieces that dental practitioners replace at some point after initially purchasing laser systems. For our Epic line of diode laser systems, we sell teeth whitening gel kits. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the sale of lasers accounted for approximately 65% of our total sales, and consumables, accessories, and services accounted for approximately 35% of our total sales.
We currently operate in a single reportable business segment. We had net revenues of $48.5 million, $39.2 million, and $22.8 million, in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and we had net losses of $28.6 million, $16.2 million, and $16.8 million for the same periods, respectively. We had total assets of $38.2 million and $55.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The disclosure set forth under Part II, Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments is hereby incorporated herein by reference.
 Industry Background
General
 Dental procedures, including medical and cosmetic treatment, are performed on hard tissue, such as bone and teeth, and soft tissue, such as gum and other oral tissue.

An estimated one-third of the worldwide population avoids going to the dentist because of “dental anxiety or fear,” according to DentaVox. Such anxiety causes dental conditions, such as gum disease, to go under-diagnosed, under-treated, and under-managed. Due to the limitations associated with traditional and alternative dental instruments, we believe there is a large market opportunity for all-tissue dental laser systems that provide superior clinical outcomes, reduce the need to use anesthesia, help reduce trauma, pain, and discomfort associated with dental procedures, and increase patient acceptance for treatment protocols. We also believe there is a growing awareness among consumers globally of the value and importance of oral health and its connections to overall systemic health and wellness. The American Academy of Periodontology estimates that over 60 million people in the U.S. alone have periodontitis, an advanced stage of gum disease, and studies indicate a link between periodontitis and other health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.
 As of 2021, according to the American Dental Association, there were approximately 202,000 professionally active dentists in the U.S. In 2022, a study published by Grandview Research estimated the global dental equipment market to be $10.6 billion and projected it to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.2% through 2030. Factors cited contributing to the growth include rising demand for dental procedures, prevalence of dental disorders, a rising geriatric population, and demand for preventive, restorative, and surgical services. The study also highlighted that dental laser equipment is expected to be the fastest growing segment over the forecast period. We believe that all-tissue laser systems have penetrated only 7-8% of U.S. dental practices and less than 2% worldwide, and we estimate a market opportunity in excess of $50 billion.
 Traditional Dental Instruments
 Dentists and other specialists utilize a variety of instruments depending on the tissue involved and the type of procedure. Most procedures require the use of multiple instruments to achieve desired results. Many of the instruments available today are based on decades-old practices. Examples are as follows:
 High-Speed Drills. Most dentists use conventional high-speed drills for hard tissue procedures, such as preparing cavities for filling, gaining access for performing root canals, and shaving or contouring oral bone tissue. Potentially adverse effects associated with drills include thermal heat transfer, vibration, pressure and noise. The cutting and grinding action of high-speed drills can cause damage, such as microfractures, to the patient’s teeth. The trauma can lead to longer recovery times and the need for future crowns and root canals. Additionally, this grinding action of high-speed drills may weaken the tooth’s underlying structure, leading to fractures and broken cusps. Procedures involving high-speed drills typically require anesthesia and are often the source of patient anxiety and fear. Because many dentists do not recommend anesthetizing more than one or two sections of the mouth in a single appointment, patients may need to return several times to complete their treatment plan.
Cutting Instruments. Soft tissue procedures are typically performed by dentists using scalpels, scissors, and other surgical tools. Due to the pain, bleeding, post-operative swelling, and discomfort associated with these instruments, most soft tissue procedures require the use of local anesthetic which may result in numbness and longer recovery time, and often require stitches. Bleeding can impair the practitioner’s visibility during the procedure, thereby reducing efficiency and is a particular problem for patients with immune deficiencies or blood disorders and for patients taking blood-thinning medications.
Alternative Dental Instruments
Alternative technologies have been developed over the years to address the problems associated with traditional methods used in dentistry. However, most alternatives have addressed either hard or soft tissue applications but not both, or have other limitations.
Electrosurge Systems. Electrosurge systems use an electrical current to heat a shaped tip that simultaneously cuts and cauterizes soft tissue, resulting in less bleeding than occurs with scalpels. However, electrosurge systems are generally less precise than lasers and can damage surrounding tissue. Electrosurge systems are also not suitable for hard tissue procedures and, due to the depth of penetration, generally require anesthesia and a lengthy healing process. Electrosurge systems generally cannot be used in areas near metal fillings and dental implants. Finally, electrosurge systems generally cannot be used to treat patients with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators.
Traditional Laser Systems. More recently, lasers have gained acceptance for use in general and cosmetic dentistry. Most lasers used in dentistry have been adapted from other medical applications, such as dermatology, but are not optimally designed to perform common dental procedures. Most dental lasers use thermal energy to cut tissue and are used primarily for soft tissue procedures.
Our Products
 Our laser systems can provide dental professionals with enhanced capabilities for minimally invasive treatment. Our product offering consists of the following:
 Waterlase all-tissue laser systems. Our all-tissue Waterlase dental laser systems currently consist of our flagship Waterlase iPlus, Waterlase Express, and Waterlase MDX. Each of these systems features a proprietary laser crystal that produces electromagnetic energy with absorption and tissue interaction characteristics specifically designed for dental procedures. They are minimally invasive and can precisely cut hard tissue, such as bone and teeth, and soft tissue, such as gums and skin, without the heat, vibration, bleeding, or pressure associated with traditional dental treatments. By combining the laser light and water, our Waterlase systems can eliminate the need for anesthesia in most cases and result in faster healing times compared to traditional methods of treatment, both of which could lead to improved patient-reported outcomes. The all-tissue Waterlase is especially effective for treating all types of dental cavities for both children and adults, moderate and advanced periodontal and peri-implant disease, root canals, and esthetic procedures for gummy smiles.
The Waterlase systems incorporate an ergonomic hand-piece and a user-friendly digital interface with presets for a wide range of clinical applications that control a combination of laser energy, air, and water, as well as the pulse rate for clinical efficiency and patient comfort. Each system also has been designed to be easily moved from operatory to operatory within a practice. We developed the Waterlase systems using internally developed intellectual property, as well as intellectual property obtained through various acquisitions. The Waterlase systems are FDA-cleared in the United States, CE mark-approved in Europe, and approved for sale in more than 80 other countries for dental uses. In the United States, we also have regulatory clearance for dermatological, aesthetic, and other general surgery uses.
 Diode soft-tissue laser systems. Our diode soft tissue laser systems currently consist of the Epic X, Epic Hygiene, and Epic 10 diode lasers that perform soft tissue, hygiene, cosmetic procedures, teeth whitening, and provide temporary pain relief. Epic X, and Epic 10 systems feature our proprietary 940 nanometer wavelength with patented pulse technology called ComfortPulse, which is designed for added patient comfort. Epic Hygiene was introduced in December 2019 as the Company’s latest innovation in proven Epic laser technology, which is designed to manage non-surgical periodontitis and increase clinical production. The system includes proven step-by-step clinical protocols, including pocket therapy and perio debridement, to facilitate implementation. The Epic Hygiene is the only hygiene specific diode laser with FDA 510 (k) clearance for Laser Bacterial Reduction (LBR), a preventive periodontal procedure conducted in conjunction with routine cleaning. Epic Hygiene, which utilizes a 980 nanometer wavelength, gives dental hygienists the ability to offer dental laser technology to their patients, including minimally invasive and less painful treatments that are designed to allow for quicker procedures and faster recovery times.
 Epic 10 is a portable, powerful diode laser that facilitates clinical versatility with surgical, pain therapy, and whitening capabilities and provides an exceptional laser with an attractive value proposition. In December 2014, we introduced the Epic X diode laser, an enhanced soft tissue laser system featuring upgrades and improvements from our Epic 10. The Epic X, Epic10, and Epic Hygiene are FDA-cleared in the United States, CE mark-approved in Europe, and approved for sale in more than 80 other countries for dental uses. In the United States, we also have regulatory clearance for dermatological, aesthetic, and other general surgery uses.
 In 2021, BIOLASE designed, developed, received FDA clearance for and began production of a laser using BIOLASE’s proprietary Er,Cr:YSGG laser technology (the "EdgePro") in partnership with EdgeEndo, a leading endodontic company. The EdgePro is a state-of-the-art microfluidic irrigation device designed to clean and disinfect root canals. The partnership with EdgeEndo is BIOLASE’s first exclusive OEM agreement.
 Related Accessories and Consumable Products
In addition to sales of our laser systems, we manufacture and sell consumable products and accessories for our laser systems. Our Waterlase and diode systems use disposable laser tips of differing sizes and shapes depending on the procedure being performed. We also market flexible fibers and hand pieces that dental practitioners replace at some point after initially purchasing laser systems. For our Epic systems, we sell teeth whitening gel kits.
Our Laser Solutions
Due to the limitations associated with traditional and alternative dental instruments, we believe there is a large market opportunity for all-tissue dental laser systems that provide superior clinical outcomes, reduce the need to use anesthesia, help reduce trauma, pain, and discomfort associated with dental procedures, and increase patient acceptance for treatment protocols.

Our Waterlase systems precisely cut hard tissue, bone, and soft tissue with minimal or no damage to surrounding tissue and dental structures. Our diode systems are designed to complement our Waterlase systems, and are used only in soft tissue procedures, pain therapy, hygiene, and cosmetic applications, including teeth whitening. The diode systems, together with our Waterlase systems, offer practitioners a broad product line with a range of features and price points.
Benefits to Dental Professionals
•Expanded range of procedures. Our laser systems allow general dentists to perform surgical and cosmetic procedures that they are unable or unwilling to perform using conventional methods and that would typically be referred to a specialist. Our laser systems allow dentists to perform these procedures easily and efficiently, increasing their range of skills, professional and patient satisfaction levels, patient retention rates, and new patient attraction rates. 
 •Additional procedures through increased information and efficiency. Our laser systems can shorten and reduce the number of patient visits, providing dental professionals with the ability to service more patients. For hard tissue procedures, our Waterlase systems can reduce the need for anesthesia, which enables the dental practitioner to perform multiple procedures in one visit. The Waterlase and diode systems cut soft tissue more precisely and with minimal bleeding when compared to traditional tools such as scalpels and electrosurge systems. We have FDA clearance for treatment indications for use that comprise our REPAIR Perio and REPAIR Implant, our proprietary periodontal protocols for subgingival calculus removal and debridement of root surfaces and implant surfaces using the Waterlase system and patented Radial and Side Firing Perio Tips. This is a minimally invasive treatment for moderate to advanced gum and peri-implant diseases, which are among the leading causes of dental health conditions for adults over age 35 and conditions that impact more than half of Americans over the age of 55. In addition, our Epic system can be used to quickly perform in-office teeth whitening with our proprietary whitening gel and to provide temporary pain relief. 
 •Greater case acceptance and patient reported outcomes. We believe the improved patient comfort and convenience offered by our laser systems, along with the reduction in chair time helps improve patient experience and patient acceptance of treatment plans. 
 •Improved clinical outcomes. Our laser systems can be used for dozens of clinical indications with reduced trauma, swelling, and general discomfort of the patient, resulting in improved clinical outcomes and less follow-up treatment. Our products are designed to collectively improve clinical outcomes, making it possible for practitioners to devote time to new cases, rather than managing or treating complications. 
 •Less Aerosols. Waterlase all-tissue laser systems create 98% less aerosols than traditional dental handpieces, meeting the American Dental Association's recommendation of reduced aerosol production to limit the spread of COVID-19. Epic soft-tissue lasers do not use water, and meet guidance from the Center for Disease Control, which recommends avoiding aerosol generating procedures whenever possible, including the use of high-speed dental handpieces, air/water syringes, and ultrasonic scalers.to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Ultrasonic scalers create a visible water spray that can contain particle droplets of water, saliva, blood, microorganisms, and other debris, which can serve as a conduit to spread the virus. In contrast, Epic technology allows dentists and hygienists to perform gentler, highly effective treatments without using water.
Benefits to Patients
 •Comfort. Our Waterlase systems allow dentists to perform minimally invasive dental procedures without anesthesia in many cases, and patients recover more comfortably, faster, and with less pain than when treated with conventional instruments. The heat, vibration, microfractures, trauma, or pressure associated with traditional dental methods are largely avoided. 
 •Convenience and efficiency. Procedures utilizing our Waterlase systems do not require anesthesia in many cases, which allows dental practitioners to perform multiple procedures in one appointment and saves patients time. 
 •Reduced trauma. Waterlase systems allow for a faster and more pleasant patient recovery with less swelling, bleeding, and general discomfort than when treated with conventional instruments. 
 Business Strategy
Our business strategy includes the following key elements:
•Increasing awareness of our products among dental practitioners. We intend to increase awareness of our products among dental practitioners by educating dental practitioners and patients about the clinical benefits of our product suite. We plan to continue participation in key industry trade shows, the World Clinical Laser Institute (“WCLI”) (which we founded in 2002), dental schools, and other educational forums. We also plan on continuing to expand our Waterlase and Epic Diode academies that we started toward the end of 2020. Our products are also used for clinical research, which often leads to published articles that can enhance awareness among dental practitioners.
 •Increasing awareness and education in laser dentistry. During 2022, we hosted 24 webinars, 183 seminars, and attended 60 tradeshows. We plan to continue these educational opportunities in 2023. We believe the Waterlase Exclusive Trial Program that we are continuing in 2023, which allows dentists to explore how our Waterlase technology improves patient outcomes during a trial period, also helps in increasing the awareness of the benefits of laser dentistry.
 •Increasing awareness of and demand for our laser systems among patients.  We also intend to increase demand for our products by educating patients about the clinical benefits of the Waterlase and diode systems. We believe that patients will understand the clinical benefits, which, in turn, will result in increased awareness of our systems from dental practitioners. During 2023, we expect to distribute a docuseries “Talk Dental to Me” that will focus on the benefits of our technology for the patient. 
 •Strengthening customer training and clinical education. We provide introductory, advanced, and specialized training on our products for dental practitioners to increase their proficiency and to certify them. Our goal is to provide our customers world class training that is accessible and can be executed with a practical technique. To further enhance our capabilities in this area, in 2023 we expect to open a world-class training facility at our corporate office location in Lake Forest, California along with our first-ever dental office adjacent to the training facility (“Laser Smiles”). 
•Strengthening sales and distribution capabilities. In the U.S., we have primarily distributed our products directly to dental practitioners via our field sales force and telesales. Sales representatives and lead generators work in partnership with the field sales team to maximize effectiveness in engaging and servicing customers. In addition to our field sales force in the U.S., we also use various independent distributors to sell and support our products throughout Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific regions. We plan to continue to build out the infrastructure to support our customers and to drive revenue and profit growth, both domestically and internationally. This includes expanding our sales presence with respect to the rapidly growing group practices, group purchasing organizations, and government channels.
 •Improving product quality. We strive to achieve the industry’s highest rate of defect-free delivery of products, maintain high quality standards, and address and timely resolve customer complaints. In the U.S., we provide maintenance and support services to customers through our support hotline and dedicated staff of in-house and field service personnel. Outside the U.S., we maintain a network of factory-certified service technicians to provide maintenance and support services to customers. In addition, during 2023 we expect to ramp up certain internal manufacturing capabilities for some of our key laser components that we believe will also improve our overall product quality.
 •Strengthening and defending technology leadership. We plan to continue protecting our intellectual property rights by expanding our existing patent portfolio in the United States and internationally. We strategically enforce our intellectual property rights worldwide. 


•Expanding our product portfolio to dental practitioners.  We plan to continue to evaluate how to optimize the manner in which we market and sell additional products to supplement our core Waterlase and Epic franchises.
 •Creating value through innovation and leveraging existing technologies into adjacent medical applications. We plan to expand our product line and clinical applications by developing enhancements and transformational innovations, including new clinical solutions for dental applications and for other adjacent medical applications. In particular, we believe that our existing technologies can provide significant improvements over existing standards of care in fields, including ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, podiatry, pain management, aesthetics/dermatology, veterinary, and consumer products. We plan to continue to explore potential collaborations to bring our proprietary laser technologies with expanded FDA-cleared indications for other medical applications in the future. In addition, we may acquire complementary products and technologies. We also aim to increase our consumables revenue by selling more single-use accessories used by dental practitioners when performing procedures using our dental laser systems.
 •Generating revenue through OEM partnerships. In addition to the new partnership with EdgeEndo, we plan to continue to explore potential collaborations to bring our proprietary laser technologies with expanded FDA-cleared indications for other medical applications in the future.
 Warranties
Our Waterlase laser systems sold domestically are covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of up to one year from the date of sale to the end-user by us or a distributor. Our diode systems sold domestically are covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of up to two years from the date of sale to the end-user by us or a distributor. Waterlase systems and diode systems sold internationally are covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of up to 24 months from date of sale to the international distributor. Our laser systems warranty covers parts and service for sales in our North American territories and parts only for international distributor sales. In North America and select international locations, we sell extended warranty contracts to our laser systems end users that cover the period after the expiration of our standard warranty coverage for our laser systems. Extended warranty coverage provided under our service contracts varies by the type of system and the level of service desired by the customer. Products or accessories remanufactured, refurbished, or sold by unauthorized parties, voids all warranties in place for such products and exempts us from liability issues relating to the use of such products.
Manufacturing
Our strategy is to manufacture products in-house when it is efficient for us to do so. We currently manufacture, assemble, and test all of our laser systems at our 26,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Corona, California. This facility is dedicated to manufacturing and warehousing. The facility is ISO 13485 certified. ISO 13485 certification signifies a comprehensive quality management system associated with the design, manufacture, installation, and servicing of our products. In addition, our U.S. facility is registered with the FDA and complies in all material respects with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation.
 We use an integrated approach to manufacturing, including the assembly of tips, laser hand pieces, fiber assemblies, laser heads, electro-mechanical subassembly, final assembly, and testing. We obtain components and subassemblies for our products from third-party suppliers, the majority of which are located in the United States. We generally purchase components and subassemblies from a limited group of suppliers through purchase orders. In general, we rely on these purchase orders and do not have written supply contracts with many of our key suppliers. Three key components used in our Waterlase system (power suppliers, laser crystals, and fiber components) are each supplied by separate single-source suppliers. In recent years, we have not experienced material delays from the suppliers of these three key components. However, an unexpected interruption from a single-source supplier could cause manufacturing delays, re-engineering, significant costs, and sales disruptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We regularly seek to identify and qualify alternate source suppliers for our key components, including but not limited to those noted above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully identify and qualify an alternate source supplier for any of our key components or that we could enter into an agreement with any such alternate source supplier on terms acceptable to us.
As discussed below, we are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA as well as other state and foreign agencies, as a manufacturer of medical devices. Such inspections can cover manufacturing, design, production, reporting, recordkeeping, and other processes and can lead to FDA observations requiring corrective action, which can disrupt normal processes.
Marketing and Sales
Marketing
We market our laser systems worldwide. Our marketing efforts are focused on driving brand awareness for our laser solutions with dental practitioners. We also continue to test methods to increase awareness of our brands’ benefits by marketing directly to patients.
Dental Practitioners. We market our laser systems to dental practitioners through regional, national, and international educational events, seminars, industry tradeshows, trade publications, digital/social media, field sales forces, and agents and distributors. We also use social media, sales materials, direct communications, public relations, and other promotional tools and materials.
 Our primary marketing message to dental practitioners focuses on the ability of our lasers to resolve dental challenges and deliver improved cash flow, which can be realized with improved patient-reported outcomes. BIOLASE Education is a leader in educating and training dental practitioners in laser dentistry. We believe that, as the community of dental practitioners that use our products expands, the BIOLASE Education will continue to deliver innovative and valued educational opportunities by utilizing the latest in learning methodologies and platforms. In addition, the World Clinical Laser Institute conducts and sponsors educational programs internationally on the use of lasers in dentistry. These are intended for dental practitioners, researchers and academicians and include both seminars and hands-on training sessions. BIOLASE has also developed a "Waterlase Academy" for Endodontists, Periodontists, Pediatric specialists and general practitioners, and an Epic Diode Academy for both dental hygienists and dentists. These academies are designed to foster peer-to-peer learning on the appropriate and effective use of our products.
We believe the Waterlase Exclusive Trial Program that we are continuing in 2023, which allows dentists to evaluate our Waterlase technology during a trial period, also helps in increasing the awareness of the benefits of laser dentistry. We have also developed relationships with research institutions, dental schools, and dental laboratories that use our products for clinical research and in-clinical training, and believe these relationships will continue to increase awareness of and demand for our products.
Patients. We believe that making patients aware of our laser systems and their benefits will motivate them to be proactive in requesting from dental practitioners laser procedures and their outcomes. During 2023, we expect to distribute a docuseries “Talk Dental to Me” that will focus on the benefits of our technology for the patient. We can be found online at www.biolase.com, and on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Instagram. Unless specifically stated otherwise, none of the information contained on any of these sites online is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference.
 Sales
We sell our products primarily to dentists in general practice through our field sales force and our distributor network. We expect our laser systems to continue to gain acceptance among periodontists, endodontists, oral surgeons, pediatric dentists, and other dental specialists as they become aware of the clinical benefits and minimally invasive treatment options available by using our laser systems.

For financial information about our long-lived assets, see Note 3 – Supplementary Balance Sheet Information, Note 4 – Intangible Assets and Goodwill, and Note 9 – Segment Information.
United States Sales. In the United States, we primarily sell our products directly to dental practitioners utilizing a field sales force consisting of laser sales representatives and regional managers. We also have an in-house sales force, which is located at our corporate headquarters and is comprised of sales representatives and lead generators who work in partnership with the field sales team to maximize sales by leveraging the existing installed customer base.
International Sales. Our distributors purchase laser systems and disposables from us at wholesale dealer prices and resell them to dentists in their sales territories. All sales to distributors are final, and we can terminate our arrangements with dealers, agents, and distributors for cause or non-performance. We have granted certain distributors the right to be our exclusive distributor in select territories. These distributors are generally required to satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements to maintain their exclusivity. We have sold our products directly to end users in Germany since 2011 and directly to end users in India and neighboring countries since 2012.
Customer Concentration. We sell our products through our field sales force, agents, and distributors. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, sales to our largest distributor worldwide accounted for approximately 4%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, of our net revenue. As of December 31, 2022, accounts receivable from one customer totaled approximately 12% of total gross accounts receivable. The entire balance is either current or outstanding for less than 30 days. No individual customer represented more than 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable at December 31, 2021.
Customer Service. We provide high quality maintenance and support services in the United States through our support hotline and dedicated staff of in-house and field service personnel. Outside the United States, we maintain a network of factory-certified service technicians to provide maintenance and support services to customers. Our international distributors are responsible for providing maintenance and support services for products sold by them. We provide parts to distributors at no additional charge for products covered under warranty.
Financing Options. Most customers (other than distributors) finance their purchases through several third-party financial institutions with which we have established good relationships. In the United States, third-party customers enter into a financing agreement with one of the financial institutions that purchases the product from us or one of our distributors. We are not party to these financing agreements. Thus, if the customer agrees to pay the financial institution in installments, we do not bear the credit risk. The financial institutions do not have recourse to us for a customer’s failure to make payments, nor do we have any obligation to take back the product.
Seasonality. Typically, we experience fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter due to seasonality. Revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is higher than average due to the buying patterns of dental practitioners. We believe that this trend exists because a significant number of dentists purchase their capital equipment towards the end of the calendar year to maximize their practice earnings while seeking to minimize their taxes. They often use certain tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation methods for purchasing capital equipment, as part of their year-end tax planning. In addition, revenue in the third quarter may be affected by vacation patterns which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year. Our historical seasonal fluctuations may also be impacted by sales promotions used by large dental distributors that encourage end-of-quarter and end-of-year buying in our industry. Because of these seasonal fluctuations, historically we have often used less cash in operations for the six months ended December 31 as compared to the six months ended June 30.

Engineering and Product Development
Engineering and product development activities are essential to maintaining and enhancing our business. We believe our engineering and product development team has demonstrated its ability to develop innovative products that meet evolving market needs. As of December 31, 2022, our engineering and product development group consists of 13 individuals with medical device or laser development experience. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our engineering and product development expenses totaled approximately $7.3 million, $6.0 million, and $3.7 million, respectively. Our current engineering and product development activities are focused on developing new product platforms, improving our existing products and technology and extending our product range in order to provide dental practitioners and patients with new and improved protocols or procedures that are less painful and have clinically superior results. Some examples of the improvements we are pursuing for our laser systems include faster cutting speed, improved ease of use, less need for anesthesia, interconnectivity, and an expanded portfolio of consumable products for use with our laser systems. Our engineering and product development activities encompass both fundamental and applied fields. We seek to improve methods to perform clinical procedures through the use of new laser wavelengths, laser operation modes and accessories.
 We also devote engineering and product development resources toward markets outside of dentistry in which we might exploit our technology platform and capabilities. We believe our laser technology and development capabilities could address unmet needs in several other medical applications, including ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, podiatry, pain management, aesthetics/dermatology, veterinary, and consumer products. We have started to enter the otolaryngology, pain management, and veterinary markets to varying degrees.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
We believe that to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property. We have developed a patent portfolio internally, and to a lesser extent through acquisitions and licensing, that covers many aspects of our product offerings. As of December 31, 2022, we maintained approximately 259 active and 24 pending United States and international patents, with the majority relating to our Waterlase technology. Our patent portfolio is regularly evaluated, and we strategically prioritize our core patents to ensure optimal Intellectual Property coverage while minimizing annual maintenance fees. While we hold a variety of patents that cover a broad range of technologies and methods, the majority of these patents provide market protection for our core technologies incorporated in our laser systems and related accessories. Existing patents related to our core technology, which are at various stages of being incorporated into our products, are scheduled to expire as follows: 5 in 2023 and the majority of the remaining patents having expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2042. With 24 patent applications pending, we expect the number of new grants to exceed the number of patents expiring. We do not expect the expiration of the expired or soon-to-expire patents to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
There are risks related to our intellectual property rights. For further details on these risks, see Item 1A — “Risk Factors.”
Competition
We operate under relatively competitive market conditions. We believe that the principal competitive factors for companies that market technologies in dental and other medical applications include acceptance by leading dental and medical practitioners, product performance, product pricing, intellectual property protection, customer education and support, timing of new product research, and development of successful national and international distribution channels.
 Our competitors vary by product and location. There are companies that market some, but not all, of the same types of products as ours. Our laser systems compete with other lasers, mostly with other wavelengths, patient outcomes, and benefit profiles, as well as with drills, scalpels, scissors, air abrasion systems, and a variety of other tools that are used to perform dental and medical procedures. We believe our products have key differentiating performance features. For example, we market diode lasers which also have FDA clearance for use in both pain management therapy and teeth whitening and our Waterlase systems have been FDA-cleared for a wide range of uses beyond dentistry, including dermatological, aesthetics, and other general surgery uses. Our teeth whitening technology competes with other in-office whitening products and high intensity lights used by dentists, as well as teeth whitening strips, and other over-the-counter products. Our pain management technology competes with a variety of traditional, advanced, and pharmaceutical pain management products and services. The dental imaging equipment and in-office milling machines that we offer compete with traditional dental laboratories, imaging centers and products and services.


Traditional tools are generally less expensive than our laser systems for performing similar procedures. For example, a high-speed drill or an electrosurge device can be purchased for less than $2,500. In addition, though our systems are superior to traditional tools in many ways, they are not intended to replace all of the applications of traditional tools, such as removing metal fillings and certain polishing and grinding functions.
Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, and/or technical resources than we do. In addition, some competitors have developed, and others may attempt to develop, products with applications similar to those performed by our products. Because of the large size of the potential market for our products, it is possible that new or existing competitors may develop competing products, procedures, or clinical solutions that could prove to be more effective, safer, or less costly than procedures using our laser systems. The introduction of new products, procedures, or clinical solutions by competitors may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, or may render our products obsolete.
 Government Regulations
FDA and Related Regulatory Requirements
Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy, and compliance to FDA Quality System Regulation and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products, in order to ensure that medical device products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable regulations can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution.
 Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket clearance, de novo classification, or a premarket approval (“PMA”) before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II, or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness.
 Most Class I devices are exempt from the requirement to obtain FDA premarket clearance or approval. For most Class II devices (and a small number of Class I devices), a company must submit to the FDA a premarket notification (known as 510(k) submission) requesting clearance to commercially distribute the device. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) devices, are placed in Class III, requiring either FDA premarket approval via a Premarket Approval (PMA) application or a De Novo petition requesting that the FDA reclassify the device into a lower class (i.e., Class II or Class I). The FDA has issued regulations identifying the Class into which different types of devices fall and identifying whether the device type is exempt from the 510(k) process or if a 510(k) is needed.
 Our products currently marketed in the United States are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances and are either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and clinical data with an assessment and mitigation of any risks involved which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device (referred to as a “predicate device”). As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process for clearance. If the FDA determines that the device is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, the FDA will issue a "Not Substantially Equivalent" letter and place the device into Class III. If the device is placed into Class III automatically based only on the lack of a predicate device and the device is lower risk, a De Novo submission may be submitted petitioning the FDA to reclassify the device into Class II or Class I, as appropriate. Moreover, the PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical data.


Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture, or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of the FDA user fee. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to ongoing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facility is subject to inspection on a periodic basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to detailed current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements, as set forth in the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which require those who design, manufacture, package, label, store, install, and service devices, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these regulations can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecution. We believe that our design, manufacturing, and quality management system are in compliance with the FDA’s regulatory requirements.
 We must also comply with post-market surveillance and complaint handling and adverse event reporting regulations, including medical device reporting (MDR) requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused an adverse event which required medical attention or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which any of our products has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. We must also comply with FDA regulations pertaining to recalls and notices of corrections and removals.
Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. In particular, the FTC has issued regulations and guidance regarding the use of social media, testimonials, and endorsements in product advertising. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other governmental agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, the FDA could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a cease and desist letter, a notice of violation, a warning letter, an injunction, a seizure, a civil fine, or criminal penalties. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired.
 Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have also been the subject of enforcement actions brought under health care reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. The FDA similarly regulates claims regarding competitor products.
 We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and we have obtained a medical device manufacturing license from the California Department of Public Health. As a medical device manufacturer, we are subject to announced and unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and the California Department of Public Health to determine our compliance with various regulations. Our subcontractors’ manufacturing facilities are also subject to inspection.
 Foreign Regulation
 Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. In the EU, placing our medical devices on the market must comply with the requirements of Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices (“MDD”), and effective May 26, 2021 the Medical Device Regulation, MDR 2017/745 which will ultimately replace the MDD upon completion of the transition periods granted to the medical device manufacturers. Applicable requirements include compliance with the essential requirements of the MDD/MDR (the “Essential Requirements”) and the CE marking process. Our devices are classified as Class I, Class IIa, or Class IIb devices.


Medical devices marketed in the EU must meet all proper regulatory requirements and have a CE mark affixed to them. For devices falling within Class I (low risk), the manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that the product complies with the Essential Requirements and must draw up a written statement to this effect (a “Declaration of Conformity”). Class I devices without a measuring function and supplied in non-sterile condition do not require the involvement of an organization designated by an EU-competent authority to assess the conformity of certain products before being placed on the EU market (a “Notified Body”).
 For devices falling within Class IIa (low – medium risk), in order to affix the CE mark and place the product on the EU market, the manufacturer must follow one of several authorization procedures involving the engagement of a Notified Body. For Class I devices, the manufacturer is responsible for declaring conformity with the provisions of the MDD/MDR and ensuring that the products comply with the Essential Requirements. This declaration must be supported by a conformity assessment by a Notified Body. Once the manufacturer has received certification from the Notified Body, it may affix the CE mark to the relevant products and place them on the EU market.
 For devices falling within Class IIb (medium – high risk) and Class III (high risk), in order to affix the CE mark and place the product on the EU market, the manufacturer must follow one of several authorization procedures. For Class IIa devices, this requires the engagement of a Notified Body. The procedure for placing Class III devices on the market is similar to that applicable for Class IIb devices. However, the manufacturer must also submit a design dossier to the Notified Body for approval under Annex II of the MDD and equivalent MDR, and some of the authorization procedures permitted for Class IIb devices are not permitted.
 Once medical devices have the CE mark and comply with other applicable regulatory requirements, they may be placed on the market in any member state of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
 In addition, other EU regulatory requirements may apply to our medical devices, including other types of CE markings having different requirements, where applicable. For example, Directive 2014/35/EU relating to the making available on the market of electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits, Directive 2014/30/EU on electromagnetic compatibility and Directive2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment may apply to our electrical products. Moreover, we must ensure compliance with applicable EU chemical legislation such as Directive 2011/65/EU on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and Regulation 1907/2006 on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. Additional EU requirements may also include safety, health, and environmental protection.
 The European Association for the Co-ordination of Consumer Representation in Standardization has cautioned that, amongst other things, CE marking cannot be considered a “safety mark” for consumers.
 CE marking is a self-certification program for Class I devices. Retailers sometimes refer to products as “CE approved,” but the CE marking does not actually signify approval. As mentioned above, certain categories of products (such as Class IIa, Class IIb and Class III medical devices) require involvement of a Notified Body to ensure conformity with relevant technical standards, but CE marking by the manufacturer in itself does not certify that this has been done.
 Our facilities manufacturing medical devices for the EEA market are EN ISO 13485 (Medical devices - Quality management systems - Requirements for regulatory purposes) certified. Moreover, our Waterlase and diode laser systems have the CE mark. In addition, we have attained the proper licensing for Waterlase and diode laser systems for sale in Canada, meeting the Canadian Medical Device Regulation requirements as part of the ISO certification process.
 Other U.S. Regulation
We and our subcontractors also must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and hazardous substance disposal. Furthermore, we are subject to various reporting requirements including those prescribed by the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We cannot be sure that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future or that these laws or regulations will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Environmental
Our manufacturing processes involve the use, generation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, including alcohol, adhesives, and cleaning materials. As such, we are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Future environmental laws may require us to alter our manufacturing processes, thereby increasing our manufacturing costs. We believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse
As a medical device manufacturer, our operations and interactions with health care providers, including dentists, are subject to extensive laws and regulations imposed at the federal, state, and local level in the U.S., including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Form 10-K. In the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback statutes that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes, or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute that prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any bribe, kickback, or other remuneration intended to induce a referral for the furnishing of, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursable under the Federal health care programs (“FHCPs”), including Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements, the U.S. Congress and the Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) within the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) have created statutory “exceptions” and regulatory “safe harbors” to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Exceptions and safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business, including, among other things, certain payments to bona fide employees, certain discount and rebate arrangements, and certain payment arrangements with health care providers, assuming all elements of the relevant exception/safe harbor have been satisfied. Although an arrangement that fits squarely into one or more of these exceptions or safe harbors may pose reduced risk of prosecution, OIG has also cautioned in various contexts that even where each component of an arrangement has been structured to satisfy a safe harbor, the components, as part of an overall arrangement, may still violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, arrangements that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor do not necessarily violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Rather, OIG and/or other government enforcement authorities will examine the facts and circumstances relevant to the specific arrangement to determine whether it involves the sorts of abuses that the statute was designed to combat. Violations of this federal law constitute a felony offense punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for corporations, civil fines of up to $100,000 per violation (as adjusted for annual inflation) and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other FHCPs. Exclusion of a manufacturer like us would preclude any FHCP from paying for the manufacturer’s products. In addition, pursuant to the changes made by the Affordable Care Act, a claim resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may serve as the basis for a false claim under the federal civil False Claims Act. Many states also have their own laws that parallel and implicate anti-kickback restrictions but may apply regardless of whether any FHCP business is involved. Federal and state anti-kickback laws may affect our sales, marketing and promotional activities, educational programs, pricing and discount practices and policies, and relationships with dental and medical providers by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with hospitals, alternate care market providers, physicians, dentists, and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products.
Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government, including FHCPs. Some suits filed under the civil False Claims Act can be brought by a “whistleblower” or a “relator” on behalf of the government, and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Manufacturers, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims. A violation of the civil False Claims Act could result in fines of up to $23,607 (as adjusted for annual inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. A civil False Claims Act violation may also provide the basis for the imposition of administrative penalties and exclusion from participation in FHCPs. In addition to the civil False Claims Act, the federal government also can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government, or improperly retained funds received which were not due. Moreover, a number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance.

In addition to the general fraud statutes mentioned above, there are a variety of other fraud and abuse laws specific to health care. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements related to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, up to ten years imprisonment (assuming no serious bodily injury or death results), or exclusion from FHCPs. The false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for items or services under a health care benefit program. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and imprisonment and could potentially result in the government’s pursuit of exclusion from FHCPs. Additionally, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services payable by Medicare or Medicaid may be liable for civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each item or service and potential exclusion from FHCPs.
The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires us to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians, dentists, teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives. These annual reports are publicly available, which could impact the number of health care providers who are willing to work with us on the research and development of our products. In addition, several states have implemented similar transparency and disclosure laws applicable to medical device manufacturers, some of which require reporting of transfers of value made to a wider variety of health care professionals and institutions.
 The federal physician self-referral prohibition (the “Stark Law”) is a strict liability, civil statute, which, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory exception, prohibits: (i) the referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients by a physician to an entity for the provision of specified "designated health care services" if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship, including an ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the entity and (ii) the submission of a bill to Medicare or Medicaid for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Penalties for violations of the Stark Law include denial of payment for the service, required refund of payments received pursuant to the prohibited referral, and civil monetary penalties for knowing violations of up to $26,125 per claim (as adjusted for annual inflation), up to $174,172 for circumvention schemes, and up to $20,731 per day for failing to report information concerning the entity’s ownership, investment, and compensation arrangements upon HHS’ request. Stark Law violations also may lead to False Claims Act liability and possible exclusion from FHCPs.
 The FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering to pay, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign official in his/her capacity or to secure any other improper advantage to obtain or retain business. Violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA by a corporation or business entity can result in criminal fines of up to $2 million and civil penalties of up to $23,011 for each violation. Individuals, including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, can be subject to a criminal fine of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment, in addition to civil penalties of up to $23,011, per violation. Also, under the alternative fines provision of the FCPA, an individual or entity can be fined an amount of up to twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from a violation.
 The FCPA’s accounting provisions require that all issuers 1) make and keep books, records, and accounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect an issuer’s transactions and dispositions of an issuer’s assets; and 2) devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to ensure management’s control, authority, and responsibility over the firm’s assets. Violations of the accounting provisions by a corporation or other business entity can result in criminal fines of up to $25 million per violation and civil penalties of up to $1,035,909. Individuals can be subject to a criminal fine of up to $5 million per violation and/or imprisonment and civil penalties of up to $207,183. As with an anti-bribery violation, under the alternative fines provision of the FCPA, an individual or entity can be fined an amount of up to twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from the violation. The SEC may also seek injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and a bar prohibiting an individual from serving as an officer or director of a public company.


Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to comply with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect some of the arrangements we have with customers, physicians, and dentists. Violations of any of these laws or any other applicable laws or regulations may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of noncompliance, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and imprisonment. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
Privacy and Security of Health Information
Numerous federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, including HIPAA. HIPAA applies to covered entities, which include, among other entities, a “health care provider” that transmits health information in electronic form in connection with certain transactions regulated under HIPAA. HIPAA also applies to “business associates,” meaning persons or entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information (“PHI”) to perform a function on behalf of, or provide a service to, a covered entity. Although we are not a covered entity, most health care (including dental) facilities that purchase our products are covered entities under HIPAA. Due to activities that we perform for or on behalf of covered entities, we may sometimes act as a business associate, or our customers may ask us to enter Business Associate Agreements and assume business associate responsibilities.
 Various implementing regulations have been promulgated under HIPAA. The HIPAA Security Rule requires implementation of certain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule governs the use and disclosure of PHI and provides certain rights to individuals with respect to that information. For example, for most uses and disclosures of PHI, other than for treatment, payment, health care operations, and certain public policy purposes, the HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires obtaining valid written authorization from the individual, including in the research context. With certain limited exceptions, the covered entity performing the research must obtain valid authorization from the research subject (or an appropriate waiver) before providing that subject’s PHI to sponsors like us. Furthermore, in most cases, the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that use or disclosure of PHI be limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the use or disclosure.
 The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules require covered entities to contractually bind us, where we are acting as a business associate, to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information that we may use, access, or disclose for purposes of services we may provide. Moreover, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) enacted in February 2009, made certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules directly applicable to business associates.
 HITECH also established breach notification requirements, increased civil penalty amounts for HIPAA violations, and requires HHS to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates to confirm compliance. In addition, HITECH authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions in response to HIPAA violations committed against residents of their respective states.
 In 2013, the Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) of HHS released an omnibus final rule (the “Final Rule”), implementing HITECH. Among other provisions, the Final Rule made certain changes to the breach notification regulations, including requiring business associates to notify covered entities if a breach occurs at or by the business associate. Following a breach of unsecured PHI, covered entities must provide notification of the breach to affected individuals, the HHS Secretary, and, for breaches affecting more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, prominent media outlets serving that state/jurisdiction. Breaches of health information can also give rise to class actions by affected individuals and result in significant reputational damage to the covered entity and/or business associates or other parties involved in the breach.
 The Final Rule also provides for heightened governmental investigations of potential non-compliance. However, the Final Rule did not address accounting of disclosures, although such regulations are forthcoming. The proposed rule addressing accounting of disclosures, if finalized, could impose a significant burden on us, as it would require covered entities and their business associates to develop systems to monitor (1) which employees access an individual's electronic PHI contained in a designated record set, (2) the time and date such access occurs, and (3) the action taken during the access session (e.g., modification, deletion, viewing).


Failure to comply with HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. Civil penalties for a single violation of the regulations occurring on or after February 18, 2009 range from $120 to more than $60,000 per violation, with a maximum penalty of $1,806,757 per year for violations of an identical provision of the regulations. Criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and imprisonment may also be imposed for certain knowing violations of HIPAA. We may be required to make costly system modifications, which may restrict our business operations, to comply with HIPAA, to the extent we act as a business associate. Our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of patient information, including state medical privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. These state laws may be similar to or possibly more stringent than the federal provisions. These laws in many cases are not preempted by the HIPAA rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and liability. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, and transmission of personal or patient information, which could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business.
New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, new state privacy laws, future Congressional action, or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health information, and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. If we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.
 Third-Party Reimbursement
Dentists and other health care providers that purchase our products may rely on third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the clinical procedures performed using our products. As a result, coverage and reimbursement of the procedures using our products is dependent in part on the policies of these payers. We believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally are reimbursable, with the exception of cosmetic applications, such as teeth whitening.
 No uniform coverage or reimbursement policy for dental and medical treatment exists among third-party payers, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer. Under Medicaid, for example, states are required to cover basic dental services for children, but retain discretion as to whether to provide coverage for dental services for adults. Under the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment benefit available to children, dental services determined to be “medically necessary” and provided at intervals that meet reasonable standards of dental practice (or at such other intervals, as indicated by medical necessity) are generally covered by Medicaid. Although not required to cover dental services for adults, most state Medicaid programs still provide a degree of coverage for at least emergency dental services.
 Original Medicare covers dental services only in certain limited circumstances. For instance, Medicare will pay for certain dental services when provided in the inpatient hospital setting if the dental procedure itself made hospitalization necessary. Medicare will also pay for certain dental services that are an integral part of a covered procedure (e.g., jaw reconstruction following accidental injury), extractions done in preparation for certain radiation treatments, and oral examinations preceding kidney transplantation or heart valve replacement, under certain circumstances. However, Medicare Advantage plans, which are health insurance plans administered by private-sector health insurers that receive payment from Medicare to provide Medicare benefits to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, may (and often do) cover additional items services beyond those covered by original Medicare, including dental items and services.
 Future legislation, regulation or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payers may adversely affect the utilization of our products. For example, the Affordable Care Act included various reforms impacting Medicare reimbursement and coverage, including revision to prospective payment systems, any of which may adversely impact any Medicare reimbursements received by our end-user customers. Moreover, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect into 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Sequestration will start again on April 1, 2022. From April 1 to June 30, 2022, payment for Medicare fee-for-service claims will be adjusted downwards by 1%; beginning July 1, 2022, the payment will be adjusted downwards by 2%.


In addition, private payers and employer-sponsored health care plans became subject to various rules and potential penalties under the Affordable Care Act. For example, health plans in the individual and small group markets were required to begin providing a core package of health care services, known as “essential health benefits.” Essential health benefits include ten general categories of care, including pediatric services, which requires coverage of dental and vision care, among other medical services, for children. The Affordable Care Act also required employers with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance coverage to full-time workers or pay a penalty, which could potentially increase the availability of third-party reimbursement for some medical procedures using our products, although we continue to assess the impact of the Affordable Care Act on our business.
We cannot be sure that government or private third-party payers will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate.
 Because third-party payments may be less than a provider’s actual costs in furnishing care, providers have incentives to lower their operating costs by utilizing products that will decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs. However, we cannot be certain that dental and medical service providers will purchase our products, despite the clinical benefits and opportunity for cost savings that we believe can be derived from their use. If providers cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, or the procedures in which they are used, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could suffer.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed 192 employees in five countries, with 188 being full-time and 173 of those full-time employees working in the United States. We also leverage a limited number of temporary employee resources from time to time. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our employee relations are good.
The Company was awarded a Top Workplaces 2022 honor by the Orange County Register Top Workplaces, as well as by the Inland News Group. The Top Workplaces award is based solely on employee feedback gathered through a third-party survey administered by employee engagement technology partner, Energage LLC. The confidential survey measures 15 culture drivers that are critical to the success of any organization, including alignment, execution, and connection.
 We are committed to diversity in our workforce, and we report diversity statistics to the BIOLASE board of directors (the “Board”) on a quarterly basis. Continuing to develop an inclusive culture in which each employee has the opportunity to contribute his or her individual talents on a daily basis is also a high priority. As the Company’s future depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain talented employees, the Company strives to select talent who share our passion for advancing dentistry and who can best help us achieve our objectives through interviews, as well as with externally-provided assessments for select positions. Compensation decisions are based on performance, external market data and internal equity. Employee retention data is reviewed on a monthly basis by Company leaders and on a quarterly basis by the Board. We strive to provide development opportunities for employees and encourage open sharing of ideas, as we know that each member of our team contributes to the Company’s performance.

1A. Risk Factors
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently consider to be immaterial could also adversely affect us. If any of the following risks come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
RISK FACTORS
 Investing in our common stock involves substantial risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors before making an investment decision. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently consider to be immaterial could also adversely affect us. If any of those risks or uncertainties come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business and Operations
Due to our accumulated deficit, recurring and negative cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 Our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The going concern basis assumes that we will continue in operation for the next 12 months and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Thus, our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Our recurring losses, negative cash flow, need for additional capital, and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to raise such capital raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For us to continue operations beyond the next 12 months and be able to discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, we must sell our products directly to end-users and through distributors, establish profitable operations through increased sales, decrease expenses, generate cash from operations or raise additional funds when needed. Our goal is to improve our financial condition and ultimately improve our financial results by increasing revenues through expanding awareness of the benefits of our dental lasers among dental specialists and general practitioners and reducing expenses. However, if we are unable to do so on a timely basis, we will be required to seek additional capital. In that event, we would seek additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our equity and debt securities, however, there can be no guarantees that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital, increase sales or reduce expenses, we will be unable to continue to fund our operations, develop our products, realize value from our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we could have to liquidate our assets, and potentially realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.
The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, similar risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks or pandemics may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and the disease caused by it, COVID-19. During 2020, the spread of the novel coronavirus led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. If such disruption and volatility recurs, there could be an increase to our cost of capital and an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital markets. In addition, efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic led to travel restrictions, prohibitions on public gatherings and closures of dental offices and clinics throughout much of Europe and the United States. The ability of our salespeople to call on dental customers during these closures was greatly limited. In addition, most dental shows and workshops scheduled in 2020 were canceled and many were moved to virtual gatherings in 2021.

We have experienced net losses for each of the past three years, and we could experience additional losses and have difficulty achieving profitability in the future.
 We had an accumulated deficit of $296.2 million as of December 31, 2022. We recorded net losses of $28.6 million, $16.2 million, and $16.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In order to achieve profitability, we must increase net revenue through new sales and control our costs. Failure to increase our net revenue and decrease our costs could cause our stock price to decline and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are vulnerable to continued global economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets.
Our business is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions as a seller of capital equipment to end users in dental professional practices. Financial markets inside the United States and internationally have experienced extreme disruption in recent times, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and declining valuations of investments. We believe these disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. A continued economic downturn and financial market disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Also, the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia as a result of the conflict in Ukraine could prevent us from performing existing contracts and pursuing new growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us, we could be unable to execute our business plan.
As of the date of this report, we do not have cash on hand to fund our proposed plan of operations over the next 12 months. In order to continue our proposed operations beyond that date we will need to either achieve a significant level of continuing cash flow from operations or raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities in the public or private markets, or through a collaborative arrangement or sale of assets. Additional financing opportunities may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on favorable terms. The availability of financing opportunities will depend, in part, on market conditions, and the outlook for our business. Any future issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, and the securities issued in such a financing could have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. In addition, if we raise additional funds through debt financing, we could be subject to debt covenants that place limitations on our operations. We could not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms, or at all, or we could use capital more rapidly than anticipated. If we cannot raise the required capital when needed, we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers, we could lose revenue and market share and we may have to curtail our capital expenditures.
If we are unable to achieve and sustain an adequate level of profitability or obtain sufficient capital in the future, we could have to curtail our capital expenditures. Any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net revenue, reduced quality of our products, increased manufacturing costs for our products, harm to our reputation, or reduced manufacturing efficiencies and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Our success depends, in part, on our relationships with, and the efforts of, third-party distributors.
We rely on exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors for a portion of our sales in North America and a majority of our sales in countries outside of the U.S. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, revenue from distributors accounted for approximately 30%, 35%, and 29% of our total net revenue, respectively. Our distributors have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources they apply to the sale of our products, and we face significant challenges and risks in expanding, training, and managing our third-party distributors, particularly given their geographically dispersed operations. Our distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations, and, regardless of the resources they commit, they may not be successful. From time to time, we may face competition or pricing pressure from one or more of our non-exclusive distributors in certain geographic areas where those distributors are selling inventory to the same customer base as us. Additionally, most of our distributor agreements can be terminated with limited notice, and we may not be able to replace any terminating distributor in a timely manner or on terms agreeable to us, if at all. If we are not able to maintain our distribution network, if our distribution network is not successful in marketing and selling our products, or if we experience a significant reduction in, cancellation, or change in the size and timing of orders from our distributors, our revenues could decline significantly and lead to an inability to meet operating cash flow requirements, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.


Dentists and patients have been hesitant in adopting laser technologies, and our inability to overcome this hesitation could limit the market acceptance of our products and our market share.
Our dental laser systems represent relatively new technologies in the dental market. Only a small percentage of dentists use lasers to perform dental procedures. Our future success will depend on our ability to increase demand for our products by demonstrating to a broad spectrum of dentists and patients the potential performance advantages of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and over competitive laser systems, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Historically, we have experienced long sales cycles because dentists have been, and could continue to be, slow to adopt new technologies on a widespread basis. As a result, we generally are required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to educate dentists about the benefits of our products in comparison to competing products and technologies before completing a sale, if any.
Any failure in our efforts to train dental practitioners could result in the misuse of our products, reduce the market acceptance of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 There is a learning process involved for dental practitioners to become proficient users of our laser systems. It is critical to the success of our sales efforts to adequately train a sufficient number of dental practitioners. Convincing dental practitioners to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. If dental practitioners are not properly trained, they could misuse or ineffectively use our products, or could be less likely to appreciate our laser systems. This could also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity, FDA regulatory action, or lawsuits against us, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and sales of our laser systems.
If future data proves to be inconsistent with our clinical results or if competitors’ products present more favorable results our revenues could decline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
If new studies or comparative studies generate results that are not as favorable as our clinical results, our revenues could decline. Additionally, if future studies indicate that our competitors’ products are more effective or safer than ours, our revenues could decline. Furthermore, dental practitioners could choose not to purchase our laser systems until they receive additional published long-term clinical evidence and recommendations from prominent dental practitioners that indicate our laser systems are effective for dental applications.
Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards could be limited.
Our ability to use our federal and state NOL carryforwards to offset potential future taxable income is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the NOL carryforwards, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all our NOL carryforwards. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $87.6 million. Of the total U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022, $11.9 million is subject to a 20 year carryover period which will be fully expired by 2038. Losses generated beginning in 2018 will carryover indefinitely. The Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $50.3 million as of December 31, 2022. Net operating loss carryforwards of the Company are subject to review and possible adjustment by the taxing authorities. With certain exceptions (e.g. the net operating loss carryforwards), the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2017. There are no tax examinations currently in progress.
 In the future, the Company’s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, and built-in items of deduction, including capitalized start-up costs and research and development costs, may be significantly limited due to changes in ownership. These changes in ownership can limit the amount of these tax benefits that can be utilized each year to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined in IRC Section 382, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50% of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups. Due to the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, the net effect of any further limitation will have no impact on results of operations. Refer to Note 5 - Income Taxes for further discussion.

We could incur problems in manufacturing our products.
In order to grow our business, we must expand our manufacturing capabilities to produce the systems and accessories necessary to meet any demand we may experience. We could encounter difficulties in increasing the production of our products, including problems involving production capacity and yields, quality control and assurance, component supply, and shortages of qualified personnel. In addition, before we can begin to expand the commercial manufacture of our products, we must ensure that any such expansion of our manufacturing facilities, processes, and quality systems, and the manufacture of our laser systems, will comply with FDA regulations governing facility compliance, quality control, and documentation policies and procedures. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, as well as various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies. From time to time, we could expend significant resources in obtaining, maintaining, and addressing our compliance with these requirements. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation and other regulatory requirements. We have experienced quality issues with components of our products supplied by third parties, and we could continue to do so. Our future success depends on our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis with acceptable manufacturing costs, while at the same time maintaining good quality control and complying with applicable regulatory requirements, and an inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, cash collections from customers, and our ability to meet operating cash flow requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We could be subject to significant warranty obligations if our products are defective, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In manufacturing our products, we depend upon third parties for the supply of various components. Many of these components require a significant degree of technical expertise to design and produce. If we fail to adequately design, or if our suppliers fail to produce components to specification, or to comply with Quality System Regulation, or if the suppliers, or we, use defective materials or workmanship in the manufacturing process, the reliability and performance of our products will be compromised. We have experienced such non-compliance with manufacturing specifications in the past and could continue to experience such non-compliance in the future, which could lead to higher costs and reduced margins.
Our products could contain defects that cannot be repaired easily and inexpensively, and we have experienced in the past and could experience in the future some or all of the following:
•loss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment; 
 •damage to our brand reputation;
 •increased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement;
 •inability to attract new customers;
 •diversion of resources from our manufacturing and engineering and development departments into our service department; and 
 •legal action. 
 Product liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation.
The sale of dental and medical devices involves the risk of product liability claims against us. Claims could exceed our product liability insurance coverage limits. Our insurance policies are subject to various standard coverage exclusions, including damage to the product itself, losses from recall of our product, and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any claims against us, nor can we be certain that our insurance will cover all liabilities resulting from such claims. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, any product liability claim brought against us could result in harm to our reputation, decreased demand for our products, costs related to litigation, product recalls, loss of revenue, an increase in our product liability insurance rates, or the inability to secure coverage in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing cash collections from customers and limiting our ability to meet our operating cash flow requirements.

Our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount or adequate quality of materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our business depends on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials, components, and subassemblies of acceptable quality and in acceptable quantities from third-party suppliers. We generally purchase components and subassemblies from a limited group of suppliers through purchase orders, rather than written supply contracts. Consequently, many of our suppliers have no obligation to continue to supply us on a long-term basis. In addition, our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers, and fluctuations in demand for the products those suppliers manufacture for others could affect their ability to deliver components for us in a timely manner. Moreover, our suppliers could encounter financial hardships, be acquired, or experience other business events unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit or prevent their ability to fulfill our orders and satisfy our requirements.
Certain components of our products, particularly specialized components used in our laser systems, are currently available only from a single source or limited sources. For example, the crystal, fiber, and hand pieces used in our Waterlase systems are each supplied by a separate single supplier. Our dependence on single-source suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules.
If any of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, or ceases to manufacture components of acceptable quality, we could incur manufacturing delays and sales disruptions while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers, and we might be unable to engage acceptable alternative suppliers on favorable terms. In addition, we could need to reengineer our components, which could require product redesign and submission to the FDA of a 510(k) application, which could significantly delay production. Any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive procedures. We are continually in the process of identifying and qualifying alternate source suppliers for our key components. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully identify and qualify an alternate source supplier for any of our key components or that we could enter into an agreement with any such alternate source supplier on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
We have significant international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating internationally.
International sales comprise a significant portion of our net revenue, and we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, international sales accounted for approximately 30%, 35%, and 29% of our net revenue, respectively. Political, economic, and health conditions outside the United States, could make it difficult for us to increase our international revenue or to operate abroad. For example, efforts to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 in Asia and Europe included travel restrictions and closures of dental offices and clinics, significantly adversely impacting our international sales in 2022 and 2021.
In addition, international operations are subject to many inherent risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating cash flow, including among others:
•adverse changes in tariffs and trade restrictions;
 •political, social, and economic instability and increased security concerns; 
 •fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 
 •longer collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities; 
 •exposure to different legal standards; 
 •transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels; 
 •reduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries; 
 •difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export, import, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses, and compliance with foreign laws;
 •the imposition of governmental controls; 


•unexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements; 
 •difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and 
 •potentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems. 
 We believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue, and we intend to expand our international operations further. In international markets where our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the relative value of the dollar against the currency in such markets could indirectly increase the price of our products in those markets and result in a decrease in sales. We do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations. However, we could do so in the future.
Security breaches of our information technology systems could harm our reputation and customer relationships. Such breaches could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.
We rely on information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. Any failure by us or our third-party service providers to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data could lead to a material disruption of our information systems and loss of business information. In addition, computer malware, viruses, software vulnerabilities, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), ransomware and general hacking have become more prevalent in the business environment, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may occur on our systems in the future. Such an attack could result in, among other things: the theft, destruction, loss, unavailability, misappropriation or release of confidential data and intellectual property; operational or business delays; cyber extortion; liability for a breach of personal financial and health information belonging to our customers and their patients or to our employees; and damage to our reputation.
 Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business due to the time and expense to respond to such an attack, recover data, and remediate information system weaknesses, each of which would disrupt our daily business operations. Further, such an attack would expose us to a risk of loss, regulatory investigations, or litigation and possible liability, including under laws that protect the privacy of personal information.
In December 2021, we experienced a cybersecurity attack that caused a brief network disruption and impacted certain systems. We have taken actions to strengthen our existing systems and implement additional prevention measures, but there is no assurance that such actions will be effective.
Our revenue and operating results fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors, so you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance.
Our revenue typically fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average, and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental practitioners. We believe that this trend exists because a significant number of dentists purchase their capital equipment towards the end of the calendar year in order to maximize their practice earnings while seeking to minimize their taxes. They often use certain tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation methods for purchasing capital equipment, as part of their year-end tax planning. In addition, revenue in the third quarter could be affected by vacation patterns, which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year. Our historical seasonal fluctuations could also be impacted by sales promotions used by large dental distributors that encourage end-of-quarter and end-of-year buying in our industry.
The expenses we incur are based, in large part, on our expectations regarding future net revenue. Since many of our costs are fixed in the short term, we could be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses if we experience a decrease in expected net revenue. Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance.

Litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are from time to time involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, competition, sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, and insurance coverage. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits could divert our management’s attention, and we could incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we could be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to unfavorable equitable remedies. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we could have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.
Our manufacturing operations are consolidated primarily in one facility. A disruption at this facility could result in a prolonged interruption of our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Substantially all of our manufacturing operations are located at our facility in Corona, California, which is near known earthquake fault zones. Although we have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities including disaster recovery planning and off-site backup of computer data, a natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could seriously harm our facility and significantly disrupt our operations. Additionally, labor disputes, maintenance requirements, power outages, equipment failures, civil unrest, or terrorist attacks affecting our Corona, California facility could significantly disrupt our operations. Our business interruption insurance coverage may not cover all or any of our losses from natural disasters or other disruptions.
If we lose our key management personnel, or are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy.
Our success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to hire and retain management, engineers, marketing and sales personnel, and technical, research and other personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing employment opportunities. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current personnel and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management, engineers, marketing and sales personnel, and other specialized technicians is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel. If we lose the services of any executive officers or key employees, our ability to achieve our business objectives could be harmed or delayed, which could have a material adverse effect on our daily operations, operating cash flows, results of operations, and ultimately share price. In general, our officers could terminate their employment at any time without notice for any reason.
Failure to meet covenants in the Credit Agreements with our debt agreements could result in acceleration of our payment obligations thereunder, and we may not be able to find alternative financing.
 Under the Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2018, as amended from time to time, between BIOLASE, Inc. and SWK, we are required to maintain a specified amount of consolidated unencumbered liquid assets as of the end of each fiscal quarter, and, if we fall below those levels, generate minimum levels of revenue as of the end of each period specified in the Credit Agreement and maintain specified levels of consolidated EBITDA as of the end of each period specified in the Credit Agreement. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by factors beyond our control.
 If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement or if the Required Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) contend that we have failed to comply with these covenants or any other restrictions, it could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which would permit or, in certain events, require SWK to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable. There can be no assurances that we will be able to repay all such amounts or able to find alternative financing in an event of a default. Even if alternative financing is available in an event of a default under the Credit Agreement, it may be on unfavorable terms, and the interest rate charged on any new borrowings could be substantially higher than the interest rate under the Credit Agreement, thus adversely affecting cash flows, results of operations, and ultimately, our ability to meet operating cash flow requirements.

The restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement and BIOLASE’s obligation to make debt payments under the Credit Agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility and may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 The Credit Agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions and covenants, which may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:
•incur additional indebtedness;
 •make investments, including acquisitions; 
 •create liens; 
 •make dividends, distributions or other restricted payments; 
 •effect affiliate transactions; 
 •enter into mergers, divisions, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our or our subsidiaries’ assets; 
 •change business activities and issue equity interests; or 
 •sell material assets (without using the proceeds thereof to repay the obligations under the Credit Agreement). 
 In addition, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as described above.
Such restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement and our repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement could have adverse consequences to us, including:
•limiting our ability to use cash;
 •limiting our flexibility in operating our business and planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; 
 •requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interests on, the indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes; 
 •restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; 
 •limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; 
 •limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and 
 •placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.
 If we fail to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement and there is an event of default, the creditor(s) may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations thereunder.
To secure the performance of our obligations under the Credit Agreement, we granted SWK security interests in substantially all of the assets of BIOLASE and certain of our foreign and domestic subsidiaries. Our failure to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement could result in an event of default thereunder. In that event, SWK will have the option to (and, in certain circumstances, will have the obligation to) foreclose on the assets of BIOLASE and certain of our subsidiaries pledged as collateral under the Credit Agreement or the other documents executed in connection with the Credit Agreement. The foreclosure on the Company’s assets could severely and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.


If we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and investors’ confidence in us, could be materially and adversely affected.
As a public company, we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the Exchange Act, including preparing annual reports, quarterly reports, and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (“NASDAQ”), expose us to lawsuits, and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms, or at all.
In addition, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to evaluate and provide a management report of our systems of internal control over financial reporting. During the course of the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, we could identify areas requiring improvement and could be required to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. This could result in significant delays and costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities.
 Any failure to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could, negatively impact the trading price of our stock, and adversely affect investors’ confidence in the Company and our ability to access capital markets for financing.
Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
If the patents that we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we could lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of others. We rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. We currently possess a number of issued patents and patent applications with respect to our products and technology. However, we cannot ensure that any additional patents will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will be effective in helping us address our competition, or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged. It is also possible that our competitors could independently develop similar or more desirable products, duplicate our products, or design products that circumvent our patents. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, there have been recent changes in the patent laws and rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and there could be future proposed changes that, if enacted, have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitive position could be adversely affected, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 If third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we could incur liabilities and costs and have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We face substantial uncertainty regarding the impact that other parties’ intellectual property positions will have on dental and other medical laser applications. The medical technology industry has in the past been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have received, and we expect to continue to receive, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation, or misuse of other parties’ proprietary rights. Some of these claims could lead to litigation. We may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of proprietary rights. A successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or redesign products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property. Additionally, we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology, and we may not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms, or at all. Refer to Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for discussion on such a pending litigation.
Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment
Changes in government regulation, failure to comply with government regulation or the inability to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our products are subject to extensive government regulation, both in the United States and globally in other countries. To clinically test, manufacture, and market products for human use, we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the FDA and comparable state and foreign agencies. Regulations adopted by the FDA are wide-ranging and govern, among other things, product design, development, manufacture and control testing, labeling control, storage, advertising, marketing, and sales. Generally, products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed for human applications. The clearance and approval process is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA can result in an enforcement action, which could include a variety of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution. The failure to receive or maintain requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes, or significant delays in obtaining such clearances or approvals, could prevent us from developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive.
If we develop new products and applications or make any significant modifications to our existing products or labeling, we will need to obtain additional regulatory clearances or approvals. Any modification that could significantly affect a product’s safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, will require a new FDA 510(k) clearance. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If 510(k) clearance is denied and a PMA application is required, we could be required to submit substantially more data and conduct human clinical testing and would very likely be subject to a significantly longer review period.
Products sold in international markets are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each respective country or region. The regulations of the European Union require that a device have the CE Mark, indicating conformance with European Union laws and regulations before it can be marketed in the European Union. The regulatory international review process varies from country to country. We rely on our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to comply with the regulatory laws of such countries. Failure to comply with the laws of such countries could prevent us from continuing to sell products in such countries. In addition, unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could impose significant costs and burdens on us, which could increase our operating expenses.
Changes in health care regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for our products as well as the way in which we conduct our business and operations. For example, in 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, which included various reforms impacting Medicare coverage and reimbursement, including revision to prospective payment systems, any of which could adversely impact any Medicare reimbursements received by our end-user customers. New legislation may be enacted as President Biden and Congress consider further reform. In addition, as a result of the focus on health care reform, there is risk that Congress could implement changes in laws and regulations governing health care service providers, including measures to control costs, and reductions in reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that government or private third-party payers will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products, in whole or in part, in the future, or that payment rates will be adequate. If providers cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, or the procedures in which they are used, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could suffer.

We could be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state health care laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and we could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such regulations.
 We are directly or indirectly, through our customers, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of governmental laws or regulations to which we or our customers are subject, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages, and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. This could harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results. If we are required to obtain permits or licensure under these laws that we do not already possess, we could become subject to substantial additional regulation or incur significant expense. Any penalties, damages, fines, or curtailment or restructuring of our operations could be significant. The risk of potential non-compliance is increased by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations and additional legal or regulatory change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, damage our reputation, and cause a material adverse effect on sales, cash collections, and our ability to meet operating cash flow requirements.
 Changes to the reimbursement rates for procedures performed using our products and measures to reduce healthcare costs may adversely impact our business.
 Dentists and other health care providers that purchase and use our products may rely on third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedures performed using our products. As a result, coverage and reimbursement of the procedures using our products is dependent in part on the policies of these payers. There is a significant trend in the healthcare industry by public and private payers to contain or reduce their costs, including by taking the following steps, among others: decreasing the portion of costs payers will cover, ceasing to provide full payment for certain products or procedures depending on outcomes, or not covering certain products or procedures at all. If payers implement any of the foregoing with respect to our procedures performed using our products, it would have an adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations.
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal, and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. Any reduction in reimbursement rates for dental procedures using our products may adversely affect our customers’ businesses and cause them to enact cost reduction measures, which could result in reduced demand for our product or additional pricing pressures.
 We could be exposed to liabilities under the FCPA, and any determination that we violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In light of our operations outside the United States, we are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from offering to pay, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign official in his/her capacity or to secure any other improper advantage to obtain or retain business. Violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA can result in criminal fines of up to $2 million and civil penalties of up to $23,011 for each violation. Individuals, including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, can be subject to a criminal fine of up to $250,000 and imprisonment, in addition to civil penalties of up to $23,011, per violation. Also, under the alternative fines provision of the FCPA an individual or entity can be fined an amount of up to twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from a violation. We could be held liable for actions taken by our distributors in violation of the FCPA, even though such partners are foreign companies that may not be subject to the FCPA. Any determination that we violated the FCPA could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.


Product sales or introductions could be delayed or canceled as a result of the FDA regulatory requirements applicable to laser products, dental devices, or both, which could cause our sales or profitability to decline and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market a medical device from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities abroad can be costly and time-consuming, and we cannot provide assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted. Pursuant to FDA regulations, unless exempt, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received 510(k) clearance or is the subject of an approved PMA. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) process, and must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies, and human clinical trials. Because we cannot provide assurance that any new products, or any product enhancements, that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancement could occur. We cannot provide assurance that the FDA will not require a new product or product enhancement to go through the lengthy and expensive PMA process. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals could:
•delay or eliminate commercialization of products we develop; 
 •require us to perform costly additional procedures; 
 •diminish any competitive advantages that we may attain; and 
 •reduce our ability to collect revenues or royalties. 
 Although we have obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market our dental laser systems, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to obtain new clearances or approvals for modifications or improvements to our products.
Our marketed products may be used by healthcare practitioners for indications that are not cleared or approved by the FDA. If the FDA finds that we marketed our products in a manner that promoted off-label use, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
 Under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means that we may not make claims about the use of any of our marketed medical device products outside of their approved or cleared indications, and that our website, advertising, promotional materials and training methods and materials may not promote or encourage unapproved uses. Note, however, that the FDA does not generally restrict healthcare providers from prescribing products for off-label uses (or using products in an off-label manner) in their practice of medicine. Should the FDA determine that our activities constitute the promotion of off-label uses, the FDA could bring action to prevent us from distributing our devices for the off-label use and could impose fines and penalties on us and our executives. In addition, failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve or clear other products in our pipeline, the withdrawal of an approved product from the market, product recalls, fines, disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions, injunctions, or criminal prosecutions. Any of these adverse regulatory actions could result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Our products are subject to recalls and other regulatory actions after receiving FDA clearance or approval.
The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, or design defects, including errors in labeling or other safety issues. Any recall would divert management’s attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers. Any recall involving our laser systems would be particularly harmful to us, because our laser systems comprise such an important part of our portfolio of products. However, any recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with the FDA’s QSR, our business would suffer.
 We and our third-party manufacturers are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA’s QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage, and shipping of our product. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections. We anticipate that in the future we will be subject to such inspections. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our product, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 If our product causes or contributes to a death or a serious injury, or malfunctions in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.
 Under the FDA’s medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our devices could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as mounting a defense to a legal action, if one were to be brought, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Risks Related to Our Stock
Failure to meet NASDAQ’s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively impact the price of our common stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital.
On January 11, 2023, BIOLASE, Inc. (the “Company”) received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, ending on January 10, 2023, the bid price for the Company’s common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Rule”). In accordance with Nasdaq rules, the Company has been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until July 10, 2023 (the “Compliance Date”), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the bid price for the Company’s common stock closes at $1.00 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Staff will provide written notification to the Company that it complies with the Bid Price Rule. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by the Compliance Date, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. To qualify, the Company would need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the additional compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary, provided that it meets the continued listing requirement for the market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards, with the exception of the bid price requirement. If the Company does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by the Compliance Date and is not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, the Staff will provide written notification to the Company that its common stock may be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal the Staff’s delisting determination to a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule.
 We have received deficiency letters from NASDAQ in the past. Most recently, in May 2021, we received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ notifying us that we violated the Bid Price Rule. After receiving an additional six months to achieve compliance with the Bid Price Rule, in April 2022 we effected 1 for 25 reverse stock split in order to achieve compliance with the Bid Price Rule
If we cannot regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule, our common stock will be subject to delisting. If that were to occur, our common stock would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. This would adversely affect the ability of investors to trade our common stock and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock.

Our stock price has been, and could continue to be, volatile.
There has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which may be unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations could negatively affect the market price of our stock. The market price and volume of our common stock could fluctuate, and in the past has fluctuated, more dramatically than the stock market in general. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the market price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $11.00 per share to a low of $0.59 per share. Stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects or other factors. Some factors, in addition to the other risk factors identified above, that could have a significant effect on our stock market price include but are not limited to the following:
•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects; 
 •our announcements or our competitors’ announcements of new products; 
 •the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC; 
 •strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 
 •new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; 
 •changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles; 
 •changes in our growth rates or our competitors’ growth rates; 
 •developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors; 
 •our inability to raise additional capital as needed; 
 •concerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products; 
 •changes in financial markets or general economic conditions; 
 •sales of stock by us or members of our management team, our Board, our significant stockholders, or certain institutional stockholders; and
 •changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally. 
 Stockholders could experience substantial dilution of their investment as a result of future sales of our equity, subsequent exercises of our outstanding warrants and options, or the future grant of equity by us.
As of the date of the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, management is evaluating all options to conserve cash and to obtain additional debt or equity financing and/or enter into a collaborative arrangement or sale of assets, to permit the Company to continue operations. Moreover, we may choose to raise additional capital from time to time, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. To the extent that we raise additional funds through the future sale of equity or convertible securities, the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by investors in the offering. Investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders.

In addition, stockholders could experience substantial dilution of their investment as a result of subsequent exercises of outstanding warrants and outstanding options and vesting of restricted stock units issued as compensation for services performed by employees, directors, consultants, and others, warrants issued in past sales of our equity, or the grant of future equity-based awards. As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate of 1.0 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans, approximately 30,000 of which were subject to options outstanding, 529,000 of which were subject to restricted stock units outstanding or expected to be issued as of that date, 32,000 Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding, and 403,000 phantom restricted stock units outstanding or expected to be issued as of that date. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, 1.4 million shares of our common stock were subject to warrants at a weighted-average exercise price of $10.17 per share. In June 2022, 726,660 pre-funded warrants, and 1,405,405 warrants were issued and in January 2023 an additional 11,403,571 pre-funded warrants were issued. All pre-funded warrants issued in 2022 were fully exercised as of December 31, 2022. To the extent that outstanding warrants or options are exercised or the convertible preferred stock is converted, our existing stockholders could experience dilution. We rely heavily on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees. The grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers could further dilute our stockholders’ interests in the Company.
Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends, our stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.
We intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on the Company, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.
