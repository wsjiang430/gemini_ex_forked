 Item 1. Business 
 Destination XL Group, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”), is the largest specialty retailer of big & tall men’s apparel with retail locations in the United States, London, England and Toronto, Canada. We operate under the trade names of Destination XL®, DXL®, DXL Men’s Apparel, DXL outlets, Casual Male XL®, Casual Male XL outlets and Rochester Clothing. We currently operate 216 DXL retail stores, 15 DXL outlet stores, 66 Casual Male XL retail stores, 30 Casual Male XL outlet stores and 5 Rochester Clothing stores and a direct business at www.dxl.com. In fiscal 2018, we launched a wholesale business unit focused on product development and distribution relationships with key retailers offering both private label and co-branded men’s big & tall apparel lines. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Destination XL Group, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our fiscal years ended February 2, 2019, February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017 as “fiscal 2018”, “fiscal 2017” and “fiscal 2016,” respectively. Fiscal 2017 was a 53-week year and fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2016 were 52-week years.
OUR INDUSTRY 
 The big & tall men’s apparel market includes pants with a waist size of 42” and greater, as well as tops sized 1XL and greater. Growth in this segment has historically been driven by rapidly changing market demographics. We believe that we can increase our market share by catering to the broader target market, attracting customers from various income, age and lifestyle segments and offering the widest selection of sizes and styles that fit well. An opportunity also exists for market share growth from the lower-size range of our market, that is, men with a 38” to 46” waist size, which we define as our “end-of-rack” customers. These sizes are usually at the high end of the size range for most men’s apparel retailers and, as a result, the selection is usually limited at such retailers.  
HISTORY 
 Our Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1976 under the name Designs, Inc. Until fiscal 1995, we operated exclusively in Levi Strauss & Co. branded apparel mall and outlet stores. In May 2002, we acquired the Casual Male business from Casual Male Corp. at a bankruptcy court-ordered auction. At the time of the acquisition, Casual Male was the largest specialty retailer of men’s clothing in the big & tall market in the United States. As a result of the acquisition, on August 8, 2002, we changed our name to “Casual Male Retail Group, Inc.” 
 Through fiscal 2010, we primarily operated Casual Male XL retail stores, Casual Male XL outlet stores and Rochester Clothing stores, along with the associated websites and catalogs. We catered to all customers through these three store formats, from our value-oriented customer (Casual Male XL outlets) to our luxury-oriented customer (Rochester Clothing stores). During that year, we tested a new store concept, Destination XL (“DXL”). The DXL store concept merged all of our existing brands under one roof, offering our customers an extensive assortment of products and an increased presence of name brands, without having to shop multiple stores. In addition to offering our customers a wide assortment, we also wanted to provide them with a unique shopping experience. We are focused on providing outstanding customer service through our DXL stores, with everything from larger fitting rooms to professional,

trained associates providing both personal attention and on-site tailoring. With the initial success of this store format, we then made a similar change to our e-commerce business in fiscal 2011 when we launched our DestinationXL.com website (now dxl.com).
 OUR BUSINESS
 We operate as an omni-channel retailer of big & tall men’s apparel.  Through our multiple brands, which include both branded apparel and private-label, we aim to provide a premium, personalized shopping experience, whether in-store or online, with a broad range of merchandise at varying price points, catering from the value-oriented customer to the luxury-oriented customer. Our objective is to appeal to all of our customers by providing a good, better, best array of product assortments in all primary lifestyles with multiple and convenient ways to shop. 
 Our DXL retail stores and e-commerce site, dxl.com, cater to all income demographics and offer our customers merchandise to fit a variety of lifestyles from casual to business, young to mature, in all price ranges and in all large sizes from XL and up. In addition, a complete offering of shoes in sizes 10W to 18W is available at dxl.com.  Our Casual Male XL stores primarily carry moderate-priced branded and private label casual sportswear and dresswear, while our Rochester Clothing stores carry fine quality, designer and branded menswear. We also operate Casual Male XL outlets and DXL outlets for our value-oriented customer. Through online marketplaces, we are able to extend our reach, by providing a select offering of our merchandise to new customers who may not be current DXL customers.  In addition to our retail channels, in fiscal 2018, we also launched a wholesale channel of our business, working with key retailers.  
 What is so unique about our business is managing the number of sizes offered to our customers to ensure proper fit and optimizing our in-stock position throughout each season. Our best-selling pant has 49 size combinations as compared to an average retailer who may only have 15 different size combinations.  We maintain a consolidated inventory across all channels that enables us to manage our in-stock position of all sizes effectively, ultimately improving customer service. Moreover, our planning and allocation methodologies, with respect to store assortment planning, help to optimize each location’s market potential without excessive inventory levels. 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 As we head into fiscal 2019, our business strategy is a continuation of the objectives that we identified at the start of fiscal 2018: customer acquisition, customer retention and customer re-activation leading to top line growth (while managing margins) and increased market share.  We are currently working on several key initiatives and strategies that we believe will drive this growth, while at the same time continually looking at opportunities where we can further improve the efficiency and productivity of our business.  
 Grow top-line sales and market share. This growth will be driven by new marketing initiatives, new merchandise initiatives, store innovation and continued branding of our DXL name: 
  
• | Customer segmentation. A significant accomplishment in fiscal 2018 was the completion of our customer segmentation study. We identified a segment, which we are calling the “Fit and Style” customer which we believe makes up a significant portion of the big & tall market, and represents a high-value customer target market. We will be using this consumer data to drive our marketing and merchandising decisions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New marketing approach. Our marketing is pivoting to a more targeted, personalized, data-driven model with updated creative and new models. We aim to use our marketing dollars more efficiently, specifically targeting our customer segments with a combination of digital advertising, radio, catalogs, loyalty program and, to a lesser extent, television. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New merchandising initiatives. Our new merchandising strategies are catering to our “Fit & Style” customer, with everyday basics now complemented with a growing percentage of “fashion” styles. Our assortments now consist of over 100 national brands and 9 private-label brands. In fiscal 2018, we added The North Face and Vineyard Vines to our list of national brands. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer experience innovation. We are very proud of our in-store customer experience. In fiscal 2019, our key objective is to provide our store associates with better tools to enhance the customer experience even further. We have launched a clienteling program, which allows our associates to “look into a guest’s closet” and see past purchases. Our in-store “Save-the-Sale” program provides our store associates the ability to access our full merchandise assortment online and add items to the sale in a complete, single seamless transaction. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rebranding of Casual Male XL stores to the DXL store format. In fiscal 2018, we re-branded three Casual Male stores to the DXL format. We have determined that the results and return on investment is sufficient to expand this test to a broader store base. We believe this approach will enable us to convert the majority of the remaining Casual Male XL stores to the DXL format, in cases where relocating to a full DXL store is not feasible. By converting our Casual Male XL stores, we can leverage the brand awareness and marketing investment in DXL. In fiscal 2019, we are planning to convert 12 Casual Males XL retail stores and 1 Casual Male XL outlet, with 10-15 stores annually after that.

Improve operating efficiency and productivity.  In fiscal 2018, as part of a corporate restructuring, we eliminated 56 positions in our corporate office and also targeted other corporate overhead costs in an effort to accelerate our path to profitability.  On an annualized basis, this restructuring will save approximately $10.0 million. We have also evaluated our store portfolio and committed to a plan to close our five remaining Rochester Clothing stores in fiscal 2019 as the lease term in each store expires.  These prime real estate stores are located in high-rent, metropolitan areas.  As DXL has grown over the past 8 years, Rochester stores have struggled to remain profitable.  With the exception of London, each Rochester store is located in close proximity to one or more DXL stores.   In fiscal 2019, we will be focused on using appropriate strategies to direct these Rochester customers to DXL. 
 Wholesale Channel. We are excited about the recent launch of our wholesale channel and believe it will be a strong complement to our retail channel.  We will be able to leverage our existing infrastructure, including DXL design, product development and sourcing capabilities.  The wholesale business affords us the opportunity to access new customers who do not currently shop at DXL, and increase our market share of certain female shoppers, gift givers, budget/convenience shoppers, and customers who do not have the convenience of a local DXL store. 
MERCHANDISE 
 We offer our customers a broad assortment of apparel that is appropriate to our diverse customer base. Regardless of our customers’ age, socioeconomic status, or lifestyle preference, we are able to assemble a wardrobe to fit their apparel needs. We offer such assortments in both private-label product and a wide array of brand name labels. With over 5,000 styles available, we carry tops in sizes up to 8XL and 8XLT, bottoms with waist sizes 38” to 70”, and shoes in sizes 10W to 18W. 
 Our stores are merchandised to showcase entire outfits by lifestyle, including traditional, active, denim, young men’s, dress wear and contemporary. This format allows us to merchandise key items and seasonal goods in prominent displays and makes coordinating outfits easier for the customer while encouraging multi-item purchases. This lifestyle layout also allows us to manage store space and product assortment more effectively in each market to target local demographics. The key item strategy is also fully integrated by lifestyle, allowing us to focus on merchandise presentation and offer our customers a compelling value proposition. 
 Merchandise assortments in our DXL stores are organized not only by lifestyle, but also within each lifestyle, the assortments are shown in a “good,” “better,” “best” and “luxury” visual presentation, again to benefit our customers’ ease of shopping. With the “best” merchandise assortments featured most prominently in the DXL store, our customers are able to visualize current fashion trends and select their wardrobes within their desired price points in a convenient manner. 
 We carry over 100 well-known national brands (“branded apparel”) as well as a number of our own private-label lines within our “good,” “better” and “best” price points.  The penetration of branded apparel in a specific DXL stores can range from 15% to 80%, depending on several factors, but on average, our DXL stores carry approximately 51% branded merchandise.  
 Higher-End Luxury Fashion Apparel -“Best” and “Luxury” Merchandise 
 Within this higher-end price range, we carry a broad selection of quality apparel from well-known branded manufacturers, such as, Brooks Brothers®,  The North Face®, Gran Sasso®, John Laing®, Remy, Psycho Bunny®, Derek Rose, Brioni®, Coppley, Eton®, Hickey Freeman®, Jack Victor®, Lucky, Michael Kors®, Pantherella®, Paul & Shark, JOE’S® Jeans, Robert Graham®, Robert Talbot, St. Hillaire, Ted Baker®, True Religion®, Turnbull & Asser®, Robert Barakett®, MVP®, and David Donahue®. 
 Moderate-Priced Apparel -“Better” Merchandise 
 We offer our customer an extensive selection of quality sportswear and dress clothing at moderate prices carrying well-known brands such as: Buffalo Jeans®, Rainforest, Brooks Brothers®, O’Neill®, Retro Brand, Cutter & Buck®, Levis®, Adidas® Golf, Columbia, Berne®, Carhartt®, Callaway®, CK Jeans®, CK Sport®,  Jockey®, Lacoste®, Majestic, Polo Ralph Lauren®, Tommy Bahama®, Tommy Hilfiger®, Vineyard Vines® and Tallia®. 
 In addition, we carry three moderate-priced private-label lines: 
  
• | Twenty Eight Degrees™ is targeted as a contemporary/modern line offering sportswear and loungewear.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Society of One is a jeanswear brand catering to the needs of the fashion denim customer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rochester is a line that targets traditional luxury styles. We also offer a complete selection of sportcoats, dress shirts and neckwear under our Rochester Black Label private label.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Value-Priced Apparel -“Good” Merchandise 
 
5


For our value-oriented customers, we carry Geoffrey Beene®, Cubavera, Nautica® and Nautica Jeans®, Dockers, Lee, Perry Ellis, Wrangler, Reebok and PX Clothing. In addition, we carry several value-priced private label lines: 

• | Harbor Bay® was our first proprietary brand and it is a traditional line that continues to represent a significant portion of our business, specifically in terms of our core basic merchandise.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gold Series™ is our core performance offering of tailored-related separates, blazers, dress slacks, dress shirts and neckwear that blends comfort features such as stretch, stain resistance and wrinkle-free fabrics with basic wardrobe essentials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Synrgy™ targets the customer looking for a contemporary/modern look.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oak Hill® is a premier line catering to those customers looking for slightly more style and quality than our Harbor Bay line but still in a traditional lifestyle.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | True Nation® is a denim-inspired line consisting of vintage-screen t-shirts and wovens and is geared towards our younger customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Island Passport® is an island-inspired line of camp shirts, printed woven shirts and relaxed island-inspired pants.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STORE CHANNEL 
 Destination XL Stores (“DXL”) 
 At February 2, 2019, we operated 216 DXL retail stores.  Our DXL store concept brings all of our brands together in one format. Within this format, we cater to our diverse customer base, with merchandise representing all price points, from our luxury brands to value-oriented brands, and all lifestyles, from business to denim.  The size of our current DXL stores averages 7,800 square feet.  In recent years, we opened smaller (5,000-6,500 square feet) DXL stores.  Because of the smaller size of these stores, they carry a smaller product offering than our other DXL stores but are representative of the “good, better, best” merchandise variety. We seek to locate our DXL stores in places that are highly visible, preferably adjacent to regional malls or other high-traffic shopping areas.
 Our DXL stores provide our customers a spacious store with up to three times the product offering of a Casual Male XL store. The merchandise in our DXL stores is organized by lifestyle: active, traditional, modern and denim with a representation of all of our brands and price points, utilizing a “good, better, best” pricing structure. Depending on the customers in each respective market, we can adjust the appropriate mix of merchandise, with varying selections from each of our price points, to cater to each demographic market. This larger store format also provides us the footprint necessary to carry a complete offering of dress wear, including tailored and “made-to-measure” custom clothing, as well as a selection of shoes in extended sizes and a broad assortment of accessories such as belts, ties, and socks. 
 During fiscal 2018, we opened two new DXL stores and rebranded three of our Casual Male XL retail stores to the DXL store concept.  Based on the positive results from the rebranding, we expect to rebrand 12 Casual Male XL retail stores and 1 Casual Male XL outlet store in fiscal 2019.  In many markets, rebranding a Casual Male XL store to a DXL stores provides a viable alternative to the more costly endeavor of relocating a Casual Male XL store to new DXL real estate. In addition, the converted stores benefit from DXL advertising.
 Casual Male XL Retail Stores 
 At February 2, 2019, we operated 66 Casual Male XL full-price retail stores, located primarily in strip centers or stand-alone locations. The majority of the merchandise carried in our Casual Male XL stores is moderate-priced basic or fashion-neutral items, such as jeans, casual slacks, t-shirts, polo shirts, dress shirts and suit separates. These stores also carry a full complement of our “better” private label collections. The average Casual Male XL retail store is approximately 3,300 square feet. 
DXL Outlet /Casual Male XL Outlet Stores
 At February 2, 2019, we operated 15 DXL outlet stores and 30 Casual Male XL outlet stores designed to offer a wide range of casual clothing for the big & tall customer at prices that are generally 20-25% lower than our moderate-priced merchandise. Much of the merchandise in our outlet stores is offered with the purchasing interests of the value-oriented customer in mind. In addition to private-label and branded merchandise at our “good” price tier, our outlets also carry clearance product obtained from DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores, offering the outlet customer the ability to purchase branded and fashion product for a reduced price. 
 The average DXL outlet is approximately 5,200 square feet and the average Casual Male XL outlet store is approximately 3,000 square feet.

Rochester Clothing Stores 
 At February 2, 2019, we operated five Rochester Clothing stores, located in major cities in the United States and one store in London, England. The Rochester Clothing stores have a wide selection of our “best” and “luxury” merchandise, which consists primarily of high-end merchandise from well-recognized brands. In addition, these stores also carry a few private-label lines that are specifically designed for our high-end customer. The average Rochester Clothing store is approximately 10,000 square feet. 
 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company made the decision to close its five Rochester Clothing stores during fiscal 2019 as our lease term in each store expires.  This was a store productivity and efficiency decision that was driven by the high occupancy costs associated with these prime locations.  The Company will continue to sell its Rochester-branded merchandise in its DXL stores and on its website. 
International
 In addition to our Rochester Clothing store located in London, England, we also have one franchised DXL store in the Middle East at the Symphony Mall in Kuwait City, Kuwait, which was opened in fiscal 2014 pursuant to a franchise agreement with The Standard Arabian Business & Enterprises Company (SABECO).  
 In the spring of fiscal 2017, we opened two DXL stores in Toronto, Canada. These are the first DXL brand stores operated by the Company outside of the United States. We believe that Canada provides a strategic growth opportunity for our DXL brand. We believe that the international big & tall men’s apparel market is currently underserved and we will continue to consider and evaluate opportunities for international growth in the future.  
DIRECT CHANNEL 
 Our direct business is a critical channel for growing sales and market share. We define our direct business (which we also refer to as e-commerce) as sales that originate online, whether through our website, those initiated online at the store level, or through a third-party marketplace. We have the ability to service our customers in-person at a store, over the telephone, or online via a computer, smartphone or tablet. 
 With the ability to showcase all of our store inventories online, we are seeing an increase in the number of transactions that are initiated online, but are ultimately completed in store.  In addition, our stores are able to fulfill an order for an item that is out-of-stock in our warehouse.  This capability has not only resulted in incremental sales, but it has also helped us reduce clearance merchandise at the store level and manage margins. 
 DXL Website 
 We are focused on providing an outstanding guest experience wherever our customer decides to shop with us, whether in our stores or online.  To further support our growing direct business, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we launched our updated website.  Our new website enhances our digital presence and provides our customers with improved functionality with fewer clicks and faster speed. More importantly, our updated website allows us to showcase our merchandise by showing a complete outfit in addition to showing the traditional individual product pages.  We believe that this approach allows us to emulate the in-store experience.  We want to provide our online customers with the tools necessary to construct a complete wardrobe.
 From our website, customers can shop merchandise from value-oriented to luxury price points, and they can tailor their search using our “size profile.”  In addition, our DXL website also offers a complete line of men’s footwear in extended sizes.  Although our DXL stores carry a limited selection of footwear, we are able to offer a full assortment of sizes and styles through our website.  The shoe assortment is a reflection of our apparel, with a broad selection from moderate to luxury and from casual to formal. We currently have a selection of more than 600 styles of shoes, ranging in sizes from 10W to 18W, including designer brands such as Cole Haan®, Allen Edmonds®, Timberland®, Calvin Klein®, Lacoste®, Donald J. Pliner and Bruno Magli®.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we purchased the domain name “dxl.com” for $1.2 million, including fees, and it now serves as the landing page for our e-commerce business. Acquiring this domain name, which mirrors our stores’ signage, was a significant acquisition for our brand and we believe it will increase traffic to our site. 
 Online Sales at Store Level
 Our omni-channel approach encourages our store associates to use our website to help fulfill our in-store customers’ clothing needs. If a wider selection of a lifestyle, color or size of an item is not available in our store, then our store associates can order the item for our 
 
7


customer online through our direct channel and have it shipped to the store or directly to the customer. Our customers also have the ability to order online and pick-up in store on the same day.
 Online Marketplaces
 Broadening our reach through online, third-party marketplaces continues to be a growth initiative for our direct business. A large portion of our assortment is available on Amazon, with Amazon Prime shipping.  Online marketplaces provide us an opportunity to grow our customer base and introduce new customers to our brand. 
WHOLESALE CHANNEL
 As part of our strategic growth plan, in fiscal 2018, we launched a wholesale channel that we believe will be a strong complement to our retail channel, focused on product development and distribution relationships with key retailers. We intend to develop and distribute both private label and co-branded big & tall men’s apparel lines. We believe that this model will allow us to leverage our existing infrastructure, including DXL technical and fashion design, product development and sourcing capabilities and provide us an opportunity to access new customers who do not currently shop at DXL. 
MERCHANDISE PLANNING AND ALLOCATION  
 Our merchandise planning and allocation function is critical to the effective management of our inventory, store assortments, product sizes and overall gross margin profitability. The merchandise planning and allocation team has an array of planning and replenishment tools available to assist in maintaining an appropriate level of inventory, in-stock positions at the store and for the direct channel, and pre-season planning for product assortments for each store and the direct channel. Additionally, in-season reporting identifies opportunities and challenges in inventory performance. Over the past several years, we have made and will continue to make investments in implementing best practice tools and processes for our merchandise planning and allocation. 
 Our core merchandise makes up approximately 38% of our merchandise assortment. Our planning and allocation team estimates quantity and demand several months in advance to optimize gross margin and minimize end-of-season merchandise for all seasonal merchandise. We develop customized assortment strategies by store that accentuate lifestyle preferences for each particular store. 
 Our merchandising data warehouse provides the merchandising team with standardized reporting for monitoring assortment performance by product category and by store, identifying in-stock positions by size and generally monitoring overall inventory levels relative to selling. At season end, we analyze the overall performance of product categories, overall assortments and specific styles by store to focus on the opportunities and challenges for the next season’s planning cycle. 
 Utilizing a set of specific universal reporting tools, we are able to fulfill the daily, weekly and monthly roles and responsibilities of the merchandise planning and allocation team. These reporting tools provide focused and actionable views of the business to optimize the overall assortment by category and by store. We believe that by having all members of the merchandise planning and allocation team follow a standardized set of processes with the use of standardized reporting tools, our inventory performance will be optimized. 
 STORE OPERATIONS
We believe that our store associates are the key to creating the highest quality experience for our customers. Beginning with the advent of our initial testing of DXL stores, we committed to change the culture in our stores from an operationally-driven organization to a sales-driven, customer-centric organization. Our overall goal was to assist our associates in becoming less task-oriented and more focused on serving the customer. We want our associates to help our customer meet his apparel needs through building his wardrobe, not just selling our customer a single item. In order to accomplish this, we invested in educating our associates.  Our associates are trained to be clothing experts, capable of accommodating our customer’s style and fit needs with ready-to-wear clothing. Our associates are well versed in not only the product selection carried in their specific store, but also the product selection carried online.  With a point-of-sale system that can access items online for the customer who is physically in the store, our associates are able to fulfill all of their customers’ needs. Our stores also offer on-site tailoring in order to assist customers in receiving a perfect fit. In addition to product knowledge, our training approach includes behavioral training as well.  A key component to the success of this program is finding the right caliber of store associates. Our multi-unit, field management team receives extensive training on recruiting associates who are the correct fit for our stores. Our new DXL store management team hires are enrolled in “The DXL Experience Training Program,” with time spent in one of our two Regional Training Centers. The culture has been created over the last eight years to promote from our internal associates, starting at the Assistant Store Manager level up to, and including, the Vice President of Store Operations and Guest Engagement level. Our Regional Vice Presidents give us touch-points in the field in addition 
 
8


to the Regional Sales Managers and the store management to ensure consistency in executing our standards and all programs and processes we deem important to our success.
 Each new member of the store management team spends time in a DXL store, working with certified training managers to solidify his or her training before being released to the respective “home” store.  This allows the new store management team members to apply the skills learned during “The DXL Experience Training Program” so they in turn will have the tools to manage their respective stores successfully. We are able to gauge the effectiveness of our training through measuring sales productivity at each level of the field organization, including individual sales associates. We believe these educational programs, together with monitoring sales metrics to help identify opportunities for further training, will improve sales productivity and strengthen our customer’s brand loyalty. 
 Each DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing store is staffed with a store manager, assistant managers and associates. The store manager is responsible for achieving certain sales and operational targets. Our stores have an incentive-based commission plan for managers and selling staff to encourage associates to focus on our customer’s wardrobing needs and sales productivity.  Our field organization strives to promote from within - a culture that has been building for eight years, with approximately 90% of the field organization’s multi-unit managers having managed one of our retail stores. 
 Our field organization is overseen by our Senior Vice President of Store Sales and Operations, Vice President of Store Operations and Guest Engagement, Regional Vice Presidents and Regional Sales Managers, who provide management development and guidance to individual store managers. Each Regional Sales Manager is responsible for hiring and developing store managers at the stores assigned to that Regional Sales Manager’s market, and for the overall operations and profitability of those stores. 
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 
 
We believe that our marketing initiatives are key to driving our top-line growth by driving traffic to our stores and website. Our focus is on increasing the awareness of our DXL brand, so shoppers will think of us when they decide to purchase big & tall men’s apparel or accessories. 
 
In fiscal 2018, our marketing expenses were $24.4 million, which was a decrease from $29.5 million in fiscal 2017.  The 2018 “Built XL” marketing campaign was broad-reaching and included two media campaigns: a Spring campaign and a Fall/Holiday campaign that each ran for six weeks.  The campaign emphasized fit, expertise, clothing brands, in-store experience, and one-stop shopping.  Our objective was to highlight our key differentiators and to make an emotional connection with our core consumer. In addition to the media campaign, we also increased the circulation of our direct mail campaign and strengthened offers under our loyalty program. During the holiday season, we tested, with positive results, a holiday catalog to a select group of our top customers, which highlighted current fashion and product offerings.
 
During fiscal 2018, we completed a six-month customer segmentation study where we surveyed over 4,000 target customers to help us further understand their shopping habits, style choices, preferred brands and other retailers they shop.  Because of this study, we have segmented our target customers into six distinct categories, with the largest segment being our “Fit & Style” customer.  This customer is not only interested in fit, but also in style.  This “Fit & Style” customer represents approximately 28% of the big & tall market according to our analysis, and we believe that he represents approximately 55% of the buying power.  Based on the results of this study, in fiscal 2019, we plan to pivot our marketing to a more targeted, personalized, data-driven model where we can create personalization and ultimately engage differently with customers in each of these six distinct categories. As such, we expect to redirect some of our broad-reach marketing costs to direct marketing initiatives, such as catalogs, digital advertising and loyalty incentives.  In addition, during fiscal 2019, we will also be implementing a new CRM system to support our customer segmentation marketing.
 GLOBAL SOURCING 
 We have strong experience in sourcing internationally. We manufacture a significant percentage of our private-label merchandise primarily in Southeast Asian countries consisting of Vietnam, Bangladesh, Cambodia and India. While we do source some merchandise from China, we are diversifying our global penetration outside of China and starting to move into additional countries with duty-free opportunities in Jordan and Mexico. We have strong-established relationships with many of the leading factories and mills on the globe. Our sourcing network consists of over 28 factories in 6 countries. Currently, approximately 50% of all our product needs are sourced directly. 
 Our global sourcing strategy is a balanced approach, which considers quality, cost and lead-time, depending on the requirements of the program. We believe our current sourcing structure is sufficient to meet our operating requirements and provide capacity for growth. The growth and effectiveness of our global direct sourcing program is a key component to the strength of merchandise margins.

In an effort to minimize foreign currency risk, all payments to our direct sourced vendors and buying agents are made in U.S. dollars through the use of letters of credit or payment on account. 
 DISTRIBUTION 
 All of our distribution operations are centralized at our headquarters located in Canton, Massachusetts. However, if merchandise is available at the store level but not available at the distribution center, many of our stores are capable of completing the order and shipping it directly to a customer. 
 We believe that having one centralized distribution facility minimizes the delivered cost of merchandise and maximizes the in-stock position of our stores. We believe that the centralized distribution system enables our stores to maximize selling space by reducing necessary levels of back-room stock carried in each store. In addition, the distribution center provides order fulfillment services for our e-commerce business. 
 Since 2003, we have utilized United Parcel Services (“UPS”) for all of our store shipments as well as our domestic customer deliveries. By utilizing UPS, we are able to track all deliveries from the warehouse to our individual stores, including the status of in-transit shipments. In addition, we are able to provide our direct customers with Authorized Return Service and Web labels, making returns more convenient for them.  Our current contract with UPS is set to expire on January 5, 2020.    
 In order to service our International customers, we have contracted with a global e-commerce company for payment and shipment services.  Through this service, international customers view and pay for products in their local currency.  Our vendor then ships directly to our customer, which we believe helps avoid potential fraud and currency exchange rate risks.
 Our warehousing application for our distribution center systems streamlines our distribution processes, enhances our in-transit times, and reduces our distribution costs substantially. We continually work to make improvements and upgrades to our software, such as automated packing for single-piece orders, barcode scanning technologies and scanning technologies for our sortation systems, in order to improve productivity and to lower packing costs.
 Our supply chain technology provides visibility for imports and domestic deliveries giving our buyers accurate shipping information and allowing the distribution center to plan staffing for arriving freight, resulting in reduced costs and improved receipt efficiency. 
 In-bound calls for our direct business are currently handled at our Canton facility and are primarily fulfilled by our distribution center.  If an order cannot be fulfilled by our distribution center, the order is completed at the store level.  
 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 The infrastructure of our management information systems is a priority to us. We believe that the investments we have made in this regard have improved our overall efficiency and, most importantly have enabled us to manage our inventory more effectively. 
 Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail merchandising and financial systems, which include merchandise planning and reporting, distribution center processing, inventory allocation, sales reporting, and financial processing and reporting. We believe that our current infrastructure provides us the ability and capacity to process transactions more efficiently and provides our management team with comprehensive tools with which to manage our business. 
 Using a retail business intelligence solution, we are able to integrate data from several sources and provide enterprise-wide analytics reporting. Over the past few years, we have developed a custom Assortment Suite application that leverages business intelligence and predictive analytics to provide high impact insights into core merchandising tasks. In an effort to improve our inventory management, we have created a standardized set of “best practices” for both our merchandise planning and allocation groups. 
 Our direct and retail channels maintain a shared inventory system and we operate a single system platform for DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing to deliver improved efficiencies. 
 In fiscal 2019, we will be continuing to upgrade our order management systems, which will improve our warehouse management and logistics capabilities for enhanced inventory visibility and order fulfillment, and we will be implementing a new CRM platform.  We continually work to improve our web environment and the security of our systems. Our mobile and tablet optimized sites capitalize on the growing use of mobile devices to look up store information, review product offerings, and complete purchases. In addition, our current website is fully integrated with a global e-commerce company to accommodate international customers by providing multi-currency pricing, payment processing, and international shipping.

COMPETITION 
 Our business faces competition from a variety of sources, including department stores such as J.C. Penney and Dillard’s, mass merchandisers such as Kohl’s, other specialty stores and discount and off-price retailers that sell big & tall men’s apparel. While we have successfully competed on the basis of merchandise selection, comfort and fit, customer service and desirable store locations, there can be no assurances that other retailers, including e-commerce retailers, will not adopt purchasing and marketing concepts similar to ours.  Discount retailers with significant buying power, such as Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney, represent a source of competition for us. The direct business has several competitors, including the King Size catalog and website as well as online marketplaces, such as Amazon. 
 The United States big & tall men’s apparel market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, specialty apparel retailers, single market operators and discount stores offering a broad range of apparel products similar to ours. Besides retail competitors, we consider any casual apparel manufacturer operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor in the casual apparel market. We believe that we are the only national operator of men’s apparel stores focused on the men’s big & tall market. 
 SEASONALITY 
 Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations as it relates to our operating income and net income. Traditionally, a significant portion of our operating income and net income is generated in the fourth quarter, as a result of the holiday season.
