ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
OUR COMPANY
 We are a leading, global manufacturer of capital equipment, including thermal processing and wafer polishing, and related consumables used in fabricating semiconductor devices, such as silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon power chips, electronic assemblies and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). We sell these products to semiconductor and automotive component manufacturers worldwide, particularly in Asia, North America and Europe.  Our strategic focus is on semiconductor growth opportunities in power electronics, leveraging our strength in our core competencies in thermal and substrate processing. We are a market leader in the high-end power chip market (SiC and 300mm silicon horizontal thermal reactor), developing and supplying essential equipment and consumables used in the semiconductor industry.
 We were incorporated in Arizona in October 1981, under the name Quartz Engineering & Materials, Inc. We changed to our present name in 1987. We categorize each of our subsidiaries into one of three operating segments, based primarily on the industry they serve:
 
 
Operating Segment | % of 2019 Consolidated Net Revenue | 
------------------+------------------------------------+---
Semiconductor | | 78 | %
SiC/LED | | 16 | %
Automation | | 6 | %

 
For information regarding net revenue, operating income and identifiable assets attributable to each of our three operating segments, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.  For information on the products of each operating segment, see “Semiconductor and SiC/LED Products” and “Discontinued Solar Operations and Products” within this “Item 1. Business” section.  For information regarding risks to our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 Our fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to the years 2019, 2018 and 2017 relate to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Our operating segments are made up of the following four wholly-owned subsidiaries:
 Semiconductor:
  
• | Bruce Technologies, a Massachusetts corporation based in North Billerica, Massachusetts, acquired in July 2004; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BTU, a Delaware corporation based in North Billerica, Massachusetts, with operations in China, Malaysia and the United Kingdom, acquired in January 2015.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, our discontinued operations are comprised of:
 Solar:
  
• | Tempress, a Texas corporation based in Vaassen, the Netherlands, acquired in 1994 and subsequently reincorporated in the Netherlands.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our previously reported Solar segment also included SoLayTec, a Netherlands Corporation, and R2D.  SoLayTec was sold in 2019 (see Notes 2 and 16).  R2D became the Automation segment.
 In April 2019, we announced that our Board determined that it was in the long-term best interest of Amtech to exit the solar business segment and focus our strategic efforts on our semiconductor and silicon carbide/polishing business segments in order to more fully realize growth opportunities we believe are presented in power semiconductors.  After announcing the planned divestiture of our Solar segment, we conducted an evaluation of our organizational structure. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we made changes to our reportable segments as shown above.  Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period segment reporting structure.
 Our major emphasis in the semiconductor industry is the development of equipment for thermal processing and deposition for semiconductor manufacturing, specifically focusing on substrate, fabrication, packaging and surface-mount technology (“SMT”). The markets we serve are experiencing technological advances and are, historically, cyclical.  Therefore, future profitability and growth depend on our ability to invest in, develop and/or acquire and market new technology products and on our ability to adapt to cyclical trends.
 Integrated circuits, optoelectronic, sensor, and discrete (O-S-D) components, such as power chips, LEDs, and some MEMS are semiconductor devices fabricated on silicon and compound silicon, such as silicon carbide, wafer substrates.  Semiconductor chips are part of the circuitry of many products including inverters, computers, telecommunications devices, automotive electronics and sensors, consumer electronics, and industrial automation and control systems. LEDs manufactured using our equipment are used in industrial, commercial and residential lighting.  Our wafer handling, thermal processing and consumable products currently address the diffusion and deposition steps used in the fabrication of semiconductors, LEDs, MEMS and the polishing of newly sliced silicon and compound semiconductor wafers, as well as the packaging and assembly of the electronic components and assemblies.  Our reflow ovens provide key thermal processing steps for both semiconductor packaging and electronics assembly. Key end-markets for these packages and assemblies include: communications, automotive electronics and sensors, computing & networking, and consumer and industrial electronics.
 Our SiC/LED segment provides solutions to the lapping and polishing marketplace for SiC power chip applications, LED, optics and photonics.  Lapping is the process of abrading components with a high degree of precision for flatness, parallelism and surface finish.   Common applications for this technology are silicon wafers for semiconductor products, compound substrates, like silicon carbide wafers, for LED and power device applications, sapphire substrates for LED lighting and mobile devices, various glass and silica components for 3D image transmission, quartz and ceramic components for telecommunications devices, medical device components and optical and photonics applications.
 We believe our product portfolio, developed through a track record of technological innovation as well as the successful integration of key acquisitions, provides exceptional value to semiconductor manufacturing by increasing yields, efficiency and throughput. We have been providing manufacturing solutions to the semiconductor industry for over 30 years and have leveraged our semiconductor technology and industry presence to capitalize on growth opportunities. Our customers use our equipment to manufacture semiconductor chips, silicon and compound semiconductor wafers and MEMS, which are used in end markets such as telecommunications, consumer and industrial electronics, computers, automotive electronics and sensors, and mobile devices. To complement our research and development efforts, we also sell our equipment to, and coordinate certain development efforts with, research institutes, universities and customers.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical and historically has experienced significant fluctuations. Our revenue is impacted by these broad industry trends.
 GROWTH AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
 Our objective is to grow revenue and expand our operations, which we seek to accomplish through the pursuit of the following strategies:
 Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in the Semiconductor Industry by Leveraging Our Thermal and Material Processing Expertise, Top-Tier Customer Relationships, Track Record of Technological Innovation and Exceptional Customer Service.  We believe that long-term growth in the semiconductor industry will be driven by emerging growth in new compound substrates, such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride, and the growing demand for 5G and mobility, consumer and industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT), A.I., Big Data, accelerated adoption of sensors and electronics in the automotive industry, and China’s investment in their domestic semiconductor production capacity.  As the semiconductor market continues to develop and evolve, advances in process technology will be vital to remaining competitive. We intend to continue leveraging our market position, relationships with leading global semiconductor customers and demonstrated track record of technical innovation and exceptional customer service to maximize sales of our current and next-generation technology solutions.
 Develop Multi-Product Solutions to Expand Our Addressable Market. We are focused on acquiring, developing and licensing new products across our business in response to customer needs in the markets we serve. As we add to our product portfolio, we plan to continue expanding our offerings within the semiconductor and silicon carbide production processes, thus capturing a greater percentage of capital spent on increasing semiconductor and silicon carbide production.  We have successfully developed products to expand our addressable market and continue to make evolutionary upgrades to our existing equipment and service offerings across our operating segments.  In addition to developing new products, we plan to invest in upgrades to our existing product offerings to stay competitive in the markets we serve.  As a result, we expect to increase our capital expenditures and research and development expenses in fiscal 2020 and beyond for these upgrades as well as for the development of specific new products.
 Pursue Strategic Acquisitions That Complement Our Strong Platform. Historically, we have developed and implemented an acquisition strategy consistent with our focus of maintaining market leadership and technology innovation that addresses the continued growth in the semiconductor industry.  As part of this strategy, we continually evaluate potential technology, product and business acquisitions or joint ventures that we believe will increase our existing market share in the semiconductor and SiC/LED industries and expand our addressable market. In evaluating these opportunities, our objectives include: enhancing our earnings and cash flows, adding complementary product offerings, expanding our geographic footprint, improving our production efficiency and expanding our customer base.  As a result, we continue to manage our balance sheet to maintain adequate liquidity in order to react quickly as these opportunities arise.
 Invest in Our Infrastructure and Capacity. In July 2019, we announced that we would be moving our SiC/LED segment to a new location in January 2020.  This new location allows us to sufficiently increase our manufacturing footprint and position our business to meet the expected longer-term increase in demand for our SiC, optics, and silicon substrate product solutions.  We are also assessing the manufacturing space used by our Semiconductor segment for capacity expansion, added efficiencies and cost savings.  This assessment could result in a future relocation of a manufacturing facility and/or investments in upgrades to existing facilities.  In addition, we are evaluating our ERP systems and needs in order to allow for greater efficiencies and to ensure our infrastructure can support our future growth plans.
SEMICONDUCTOR AND SiC/LED OPERATIONS 
 We provide diffusion and reflow equipment as well as wafer polishing equipment and related services to leading semiconductor manufacturers. Our products include horizontal diffusion furnaces used to produce semiconductors, silicon wafers and MEMS, as well as double-sided lapping and polishing equipment, double-sided lapping and polishing carriers, single side polishing templates, mass wafer transfer systems, loaders and sorters.

As demand for increasingly sophisticated electronic devices continues, new technologies such as electric and autonomous automobiles, artificial intelligence, advanced power management, advances in consumer electronics, mobile devices and IoT will help to drive future growth. Electronic equipment continues to become more complex, yet end users are still demanding smaller, lighter and less expensive devices. This, in turn, requires increased performance and reduced cost, size, weight and power requirements of electronic assemblies, printed circuit boards and semiconductors. In response to these developments, manufacturers are increasingly employing more sophisticated production and assembly techniques requiring more advanced manufacturing equipment, such as that supplied by our subsidiary, BTU.
 Although the semiconductor market has experienced significant growth over the past fifteen years, it remains cyclical by nature. The market is characterized by short-term periods of under or over utilization of capacity for most semiconductors, including microprocessors, memory, power management chips and other logic devices.  When capacity utilization decreases due to the addition of excess capacity, semiconductor manufacturers typically slow their purchasing of capital equipment. Conversely, when capacity utilization increases, so does capital spending.
 AUTOMATION OPERATIONS
 We are a leading supplier of semiconductor and solar automation with in-house design and manufacturing capabilities and offer a full array of single wafer transfer tools as well as batch transfer tools and stocker options.  We offer furnace automation and wafer handling systems used within semiconductor wafer and device processing steps. Our automation equipment includes mass wafer transfer systems, sorters, long-boat transfer systems, load station elevators, buffers and conveyers, which we sell both in connection with our diffusion furnaces and on a standalone basis.  In November 2019, we completed the sale of our subsidiary, R2D, to certain members of R2D’s management team.  We will recognize a loss of approximately $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 and R2D will no longer be included in our consolidated financial statements.
SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS
 Our furnace and automation equipment are manufactured in our facilities in Massachusetts, the Netherlands, France and China. The following paragraphs describe the products that comprise our semiconductor business:
 Horizontal Diffusion Furnaces. Through Bruce Technologies, we produce and sell 200mm and 300mm horizontal diffusion and deposition furnaces. Our horizontal furnaces currently address several steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process, including diffusion, LPCVD, high temperature oxidation (used in silicon and silicon carbide power chips), and annealing.
 Our horizontal furnaces generally consist of three large modules: the load station, where the loading of the wafers occurs; the furnace section, which is comprised of one to four thermal reactor chambers; and the gas distribution cabinet, where the flow of gases into the reactor chambers is controlled, and is often customized to meet the requirements of our customers’ particular processes. The horizontal furnaces utilize a combination of existing industry and proprietary technologies and are sold primarily to semiconductor customers. Our products are capable of processing all currently existing wafer sizes.
 Continuous Thermal Processing Systems. Through BTU, we produce and sell thermal processing systems used in the solder reflow and curing stages of printed circuit board assembly as well as systems for the thermal processes used in advanced semiconductor packaging. Our printed circuit board assembly products are used primarily in the advanced, high-density segments of the market that utilize surface mount technology.
 Flip-chip reflow provides the physical and electronic bond of the semiconductor device to its package. Our range of convection reflow systems, utilizing patented closed loop convection technology, are rated at up to 400°C and operate in air or nitrogen atmospheres. These products utilize forced impingement convection technology to transfer heat to the substrate. Using thermal power arrays of up to five kilowatts, they can process substrates in dual lane, dual speed configurations, thereby enabling our customers to double production without increasing the machine’s footprint. These products are available in four models based on the heated lengths of thermal processing chambers. Heated length is based on the required production rate and loading requirements.
 9


High-Temperature Belt Furnace.  We also produce and sell custom, high-temperature belt furnaces, which have been manufactured in Massachusetts for over six decades with ISO 9001:2015 quality certification safeguarding that each unit is subject to exacting build and test criteria.
 SiC/LED PRODUCTS
 Our SiC/LED segment manufactures the products described below in Pennsylvania and sells them under our PR Hoffman brand name.
 Substrate Carriers.  We manufacture carriers in a variety of sizes and materials.  Sizes range from 3 to 38 inches in diameter using a variety of special steels, laminates and extruded polymer raw materials.  Silicon wafers, compound semiconductor wafers, and large optics require special insert carriers.  These carriers combine the strength of hardened steel as the processing backbone with a softer plastic material in the work holes known as an insert.  Inserts are permanently molded into the work holes in a pressurized process.  These inserted work holes provide smoother processing, improved wafer total thickness variation (TTV) and improved wafer edge quality.  Insert carriers are available for all wafer sizes from 75mm to 450mm and can be made from hardened and tempered carbon steel or specialized stainless steel when metal contamination is a processing concern.  Insert carriers are widely accepted as the industry solution for both prime wafer and reclaim wafer manufacturers when dual sided lapping or polishing are utilized in their front-end wafer process.
 Substrate Polishing Templates. Our polishing templates are used to securely hold silicon carbide, silicon, sapphire or other wafer materials in place during single-sided wax-free polishing processes. Polishing templates are customized for specific applications and are manufactured to extremely tight tolerances. We offer a variety of options to provide the best solution for each specific process. Polishing templates are manufactured for all brands of tools and virtually any wax-free customer process. Critical front-end wafer surface specifications are finalized during the polishing process.
 Double-Sided Lapping and Polishing Machines. Double-sided lapping and polishing machines are designed to process materials such as silicon wafers, sapphire and other wafer-like materials, precision optics, computer disks, ceramic components, specialty metal products to exact tolerances of thickness, flatness, parallelism and surface finish. On average, we believe that we offer our surface processing systems with a lower cost of ownership than systems offered by our competitors.  We target the compound substrate, semiconductor, optical sapphire, glass, quartz, ceramics, medical, computer disk and metal working markets.
 AUTOMATION PRODUCTS
 Our R2D automation equipment includes batch wafer transfer systems, sorters, long-boat transfer systems, load station elevators, buffers and conveyers. We use vacuum technology in our Standalone and our Full Automation wafer transfer systems designed to ensure high throughput and reduced breakage, resulting in increased yield. 
 Use of our automation products reduces human handling and, therefore, reduces exposure of wafers to particle sources and breakage during the loading and unloading of the process tubes and protects operators from heat and chemical fumes. The top reactor chamber of a horizontal furnace can be as much as eight feet from the floor on which the operator stands when manually loading wafer boats.  Typical boats of 150mm to 300mm wafers weigh three to six pounds. Given these two factors, automating the wafer loading and unloading of a diffusion furnace improves employee safety and ergonomics in silicon wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities.
 S-300. Our patented S-300 model provides an efficient method of automatically transporting a full batch of up to 300 wafers to the designated tube level and automatically placing them directly onto the cantilever loader of a diffusion furnace. This product is suitable for the production of nearly all semiconductors manufactured using a horizontal furnace. The S-300 can be used in conjunction with all current wafer sizes and is particularly well suited for manufacturers of 300mm wafers.
 10


Comet and Gemini. Our Comet and Gemini series of wafer transfer systems include a wide range of configurations and footprints to meet the needs of our customers who serve the semiconductor industry.  Comet Sorter with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used in sorting, randomizing, compacting or tracking.  The Comet Sorter is cassette to cassette with OCR front and back scribe functions, notch alignment and SECSII Gem communication.  Comet ID Readers check tag carriers, then read each wafer scribe. The Comet ID Reader sends the information to the host with SECSII Gem commands.
 We also specialize in precision controlled, high-temperature belt furnaces for a wide range of custom applications, such as brazing, direct bond copper (DBC), diffusion, sintering and heat treatment. These controlled atmosphere furnaces are available with temperature ranges up to 1150°C and with various process atmospheres, including hydrogen and nitrogen.
 MANUFACTURING, RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES 
 Our semiconductor manufacturing activities consist primarily of engineering design to meet specific and evolving customer needs and procurement and assembly of various commercial and proprietary components into finished thermal processing systems and related automation in North Billerica, Massachusetts; Shanghai, China; and Clapiers, France.
 Our manufacturing activities in the polishing business include laser-cutting and other fabrication steps in producing lapping and polishing consumables, including carriers, templates, gears, wear items and spare parts in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, from raw materials manufactured to our specifications by our suppliers. These products are engineered and designed for specific applications and to meet the increasingly tight tolerances required by our customers.  Many items, such as proprietary components for our semiconductor equipment and lapping plates, are purchased from suppliers who manufacture these items to our specifications.
 Final assembly and tests of our manufactured equipment and machines are performed within our manufacturing facilities. Quality control is maintained through inspection of incoming materials and components, in-process inspection during equipment assembly, testing of assemblies and final inspection and, when practical, operation of manufactured equipment prior to shipment.
 Since much of our polishing supplies know-how relates to the manufacture of these products, our Carlisle facility is equipped to perform a significantly higher percentage of the fabrication steps required in the production of its products. However, injection molding for our insert carriers and the manufacture of raw cast iron plates are subcontracted out to various third parties. Our polishing supplies business relies on key suppliers for certain materials, including two steel mills in Germany and Japan, an injection molder, a single-sourced pad supplier from Japan and an adhesive manufacturer. To minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts, we seek to maintain appropriate inventory levels of key raw materials and parts.
 Throughout fiscal 2019, we experienced increased lead times for various parts and services across all our operating segments.  The most significant lead times related to silicon carbide and custom-molded parts.  As a result of the increases in lead-times for these parts, we have increased the amount of on-hand inventory related to long-lead time items, however, there can be no assurance that we will have enough inventory on-hand at the time we receive orders and that we will not incur delays in production time.
 CUSTOMERS AND SEASONALITY
 Our customers are primarily manufacturers of integrated circuits.  During 2019, 59% of our net revenue from continuing operations came from customers outside of North America. This group represented 76% of revenues in 2018.  In 2019, net revenue from continuing operations was distributed among customers in different geographic regions as follows: North/South America 41% (35% of which is in the United States), Asia 41% (including 18% to China, 5% to Malaysia and 10% to Taiwan) and Europe 18%.  No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues from our continuing operations in 2019.  In 2018, one Semiconductor customer individually accounted for 14% of our net revenues. In 2017, one Semiconductor customer accounted for 13% of our net revenues.  A turnkey customer accounted for 58% and 50% of net revenues at our discontinued operations in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 11


Our business is not seasonal in nature, but is cyclical based on the capital equipment investment patterns of semiconductor manufacturers. These expenditure patterns are based on many factors, including capacity utilization, anticipated demand, the development of new technologies and global and regional economic conditions.
 SALES AND MARKETING
 Due to the highly technical nature of our products, we market our products primarily by direct customer contact through our sales personnel and through a network of domestic and international independent sales representatives and distributors that specialize in semiconductor equipment and supplies. Our promotional activities include direct sales contacts, participation in trade shows, an internet website, advertising in trade magazines and the distribution of product brochures.
 Sales to distributors are generally on terms comparable to sales to end-user customers, as our distributors generally quote their customers after first obtaining a quote from us and have an order from the end-user before placing an order with us. Our sales to distributors are not contingent on their future sales and do not include a general right of return. Historically, returns have been rare. Distributors of our semiconductor equipment do not stock a significant amount of our products, as the inventory they hold is generally limited to parts needed to provide timely repairs to customers.
 RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING
 The markets we serve are characterized by rapidly-evolving industry standards and technological change. To compete effectively, we must continually maintain or exceed the pace of such change by improving our products and our process technologies and by developing new technologies and products that are competitive based on price and performance. To assure that these technologies and products address current and future customer requirements, we obtain as much customer cooperation and input as possible, thus increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our research and development efforts. In addition, we look for strategic acquisitions, that will provide us with new technologies to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate.
 From time to time we add functionality to our products or develop new products during engineering and manufacturing to fulfill specifications in a customer’s order, in which case the cost of development, along with other costs of the order, are charged to cost of sales. We periodically receive research grants for research and development of products, which are netted against our research, development and engineering costs.  In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded research, development and engineering expense of $3.1 million, $2.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively.  We plan to continue to add new products and also to invest in upgrades to existing product offerings to stay competitive in the markets we serve.  As a result, we expect to increase our capital expenditures and research and development expenses in fiscal 2020 for these upgrades as well as for the development of specific new products.
COMPETITION
 We compete in several distinct equipment markets for semiconductor devices, semiconductor wafers, MEMS, electronics assembly, lapping and polishing machines as well as the markets for supplies used in the LED, mobile devices and semiconductor industries. Each of these markets is highly competitive. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to continually improve our products, processes and services, as well as our ability to develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors for succeeding in these markets include the product’s technical capability, productivity, cost-effectiveness, overall reliability, ease of use and maintenance, contamination and defect control and the level of technical service and support.
 The Semiconductor Device and MEMS Markets. Equipment and automation produced by our Semiconductor operating segment primarily competes with those produced by other original equipment manufacturers, some of which are well-established firms that are much larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have with which to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. Competitors of our horizontal diffusion furnaces include Centrotherm GmbH, Sandvik Thermal Process, Inc., a subsidiary of Sandvik AB, CVD Equipment, Inc., Semco Engineering S.A. and Meyer Burger, Ltd.
 12


Our principal competitors for printed circuit board assembly equipment and advanced semiconductor packaging vary by product application. The principal competitors for solder reflow systems are ITW/EAE Vitronics-Soltec, Heller, Folungwin, ERSA, Shenzhen JT Automation Equipment Co., Ltd. and Rehm. The principal competitors for advanced semiconductor packaging are ITW/EAE Vitronics-Soltec and Heller. Our in-line, controlled atmosphere furnaces compete primarily against products offered by Centrotherm and SierraTherm/Schmid Thermal Systems. We also face competition from emerging low-cost Asian manufacturers and other established European manufacturers.
 Although price is a factor in buying decisions, we believe that technological leadership, process capability, throughput, safer designs, uptime, mean time-to-repair, cost of ownership and after-sale support have become increasingly important factors to purchasers of our products. As such, we believe we compete primarily on the basis of these criteria, rather than on the basis of price alone.
 General Industrial Lapping and Polishing Machines, Supplies and Semiconductor Wafer Markets. Our SiC/LED operating segment experiences price competition for wafer carriers from foreign manufacturers for which there is very little publicly available information. As a result, we are intensifying our efforts to reduce the cost of our carriers and will continue to compete with other manufacturers of carriers by continuing to update our product line to keep pace with the rapid changes in our customers’ requirements and by providing a high level of quality and customer service. We produce steel carriers, including insert carriers, on an advanced laser-cutting tool, which reduces our costs and lead times and increases our control over quality.  Competitors of our lapping and polishing machines and supplies include Lapmaster Wolters, Speedfam Co. Ltd., Hamai Co., Ltd., Onse, Inc. and Eminess Technologies, Inc.  Our strategy to enhance our sales of wafer carriers and templates includes developing new applications in close collaboration with our customers, continuous improvement in our products and providing a high level of customer support and products that deliver greater value to our customers.
EMPLOYEES
 As of September 30, 2019, we employed 415 people. Of these employees, 12 were based at our corporate offices in Tempe, Arizona, 39 at our manufacturing plant in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, 99 at our manufacturing plant in N. Billerica, Massachusetts, 134 at our facilities in China, 12 at other Asia-Pacific offices, 37 at our facilities in France, 7 at our office in the United Kingdom and 75 at our Solar discontinued operations. Of the 39 people employed at our Carlisle, Pennsylvania facility, 19 were represented by the United Auto Workers Union - Local 1443. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike, and other than employees at the Carlisle facility, no other employees are represented by a union. Certain of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  We consider our employee relations to be good.

 DISCONTINUED SOLAR OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS
 On April 3, 2019, we announced that the Board determined that it was in the long-term best interest of the Company to exit the Solar business segment and to focus our strategic efforts on our semiconductor and silicon carbide/polishing business segments in order to more fully realize the opportunities we believe are presented in those markets. The anticipated divestiture included our Tempress and SoLayTec subsidiaries, which comprised substantially all of our Solar segment.
 The Board made its decision after analyzing our past performance, current market conditions and the strategic outlook for our Solar segment, which operates in a highly competitive market among lower cost manufacturers, particularly in China. Historical fluctuations in the solar cell industry combined with downward pricing pressure has negatively affected the Company’s results of operations in recent years. This pricing pressure has contributed to the losses incurred by our Solar segment and overshadowed the revenue growth and profitability of our semiconductor and silicon carbide/polishing segments. While we have in the past and are currently taking actions to reduce headcount and lower our cost structure, the process involved in the Netherlands to accomplish these actions takes significant time, during which losses and cash burn are likely to continue. As previously disclosed in our periodic reports, we had been pursuing strategic alternatives for the continued operation of the Solar segment. After further assessment, however (including input from management of the Solar segment and our professional advisors), the Board determined that the investment required to return our Solar business to profitability would be better utilized to pursue strategic opportunities in the Semiconductor and SiC/LED segments.
 On June 7, 2019 (“Sale Date”), we completed the sale of our subsidiary, SoLayTec, to a third party located in the Netherlands. Upon the Sale Date, we recognized a gain of approximately $1.6 million, which we included in loss from discontinued operations reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2019. Also, effective on the Sale Date, SoLayTec is no longer included in our consolidated financial statements. SoLayTec is not material to Amtech’s results of operations or financial position. 
 14


Our Solar discontinued operations provide process equipment and related cell manufacturing equipment to many of the world’s leading solar cell manufacturers.
 Our primary process equipment focus is our existing solar diffusion furnace and the development of next-generation diffusion furnaces, including our proprietary N-type systems and our PECVD systems.  Additionally, through SoLayTec, we produced, developed, delivered and serviced ultrafast ALD machines used in high efficiency solar cells.
 Although the solar market has experienced tremendous growth over the past five years, it is characterized by periods of rapid capacity expansion followed by periods of rapid contraction in our customers’ capital spending.  When actual and expected end-user demand outstrips available capacity, this triggers the beginning of the next period of expansion.
 Solar Cell Markets. Our Solar discontinued operations experiences increased competition from local Chinese equipment manufacturers, including S.C New Energy, 48th Institute and Naura Technology Group Co., which may receive varying levels of financial support from the Chinese government. Our primary competitive advantages over such local manufacturers include our high-throughput equipment platforms, higher-efficiency solar cell production technologies, greater knowledge of the complete cell manufacturing process and advanced automation, which we develop in collaboration with customers and research institutes.
 We have developed two applications utilized in solar device technology. Our solar PECVD product applies an anti-reflective coating to solar wafers; a coating critical to the efficiency of solar cells.  PECVD layers are also used for passivation of the front and/or back side of the solar cell. We recently introduced TOPCON technology, a new application in solar cell processing offering cell efficiency potentials of greater than 22%. We are exploring next-generation high-efficiency technology and dedicating our efforts to process development.
 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
 In September 2015, we sold a portion of our equity interest in Kingstone Hong Kong to a China-based venture capital firm.  Kingstone Hong Kong is the parent company of Shanghai Kingstone, a Shanghai-based technology company specializing in ion implant solutions for the solar and semiconductor industries (in which we acquired a 55% ownership in February 2011). Proceeds from this sale were paid to Amtech and used to fund our core strategic initiatives. After giving effect to this sale transaction, we owned 15% of Kingstone Hong Kong, which in turn represented an 8% beneficial ownership interest in Shanghai Kingstone.  Effective June 29, 2018, we sold this remaining 15% ownership interest in Kingstone Hong Kong to the majority owner for approximately $5.7 million.
 In December 2014, in furtherance of our business model and growth through strategic acquisitions, we expanded our presence in the solar market by acquiring a 51% controlling interest in SoLayTec, which provides ALD systems used in high efficiency solar cells.  In July 2017, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in SoLayTec.  On June 7, 2019, we completed the sale of SoLayTec to a third party located in the Netherlands.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 For the Years Ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017
 1.  Summary of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
 Description of Business – Amtech is a leading, global manufacturer of capital equipment, including thermal processing and wafer polishing, and related consumables used in fabricating semiconductor devices, such as silicon carbide (SiC) and silicon power chips, electronic assemblies and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). We sell these products to semiconductor and automotive component manufacturers worldwide, particularly in Asia, North America and Europe.
 We serve niche markets in industries that are experiencing technological advances, and which historically have been very cyclical. Therefore, future profitability and growth depend on our ability to develop or acquire and market profitable new products and on our ability to adapt to cyclical trends.
 In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we began the process to divest our solar business. As such, we have classified substantially all of the Solar segment as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reported its results as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For additional information on the divestiture, see Note 16. For additional information on our segments, see Note 18.
 Our fiscal year is from October 1 to September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to the years 2019, 2018 and 2017 relate to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Principles of Consolidation – The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest.  We report non-controlling interests in consolidated entities as a component of equity separate from our equity.  The equity method of accounting is used for investments over which we have a significant influence but not a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Effective July 1, 2017, we purchased the non-controlling interest in SoLayTec, pursuant to which SoLayTec became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amtech.  Beginning July 1, 2017 through the disposal date of SoLayTec (see Note 16), the non-controlling interest is no longer reported.  Prior amounts have not been restated.
 Use of Estimates – The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 Reclassifications – Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. Results for all periods presented in this report have been reclassified for discontinued operations (Note 2) and for changes to our reportable segments (Note 18). These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported Consolidated Financial Statements for any period.
 Divestitures – Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:
 Discontinued Operations – A business is classified as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations or financial results and meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale or is disposed of by sale or otherwise. Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met. If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
 54


Assets Held for Sale – An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control. The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents – We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts invested in U.S. money market funds and various U.S. and foreign bank operating and time deposit accounts.
 Restricted Cash – Restricted cash includes collateral for bank guarantees required by certain customers from whom deposits have been received in advance of shipment.
 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts – Accounts receivable are recorded at the sales price of products sold to customers on trade credit terms. Accounts receivable are considered past due when payment has not been received from the customer within the normal credit terms extended to that customer. A valuation allowance is established for accounts when collection is no longer probable. Accounts are written off against the allowance when the probability of collection is remote.
 Inventory – We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Costs for over 90% of inventory at our continuing operations as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 are determined on a FIFO basis, with the remainder determined on an average cost basis. We regularly review inventory quantities and record a write-down to net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory. The write-down is primarily based on historical inventory usage adjusted for expected changes in product demand and production requirements. Our industry is characterized by customers in highly cyclical industries, rapid technological changes, frequent new product developments and rapid product obsolescence. Changes in demand for our products and product mix could result in further write-downs.
 We must order components for our products and build inventory in advance of product shipments through issuance of purchase orders based on projected demand. These commitments typically cover our requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 180 days or longer when there is a significant increase in demand or lead-times from suppliers. These purchase commitments may result in accepting delivery of components not needed to meet current demand.  We accrue for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled, and for excess inventories that will likely result in our taking delivery of ordered inventory items in excess of our projected needs. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of our products, an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of our products, or a change in our suppliers’ practice of not enforcing purchase commitments, we may be required to record additional charges for these items.  This would negatively impact gross margin in the period when the charges are recorded.
 Property, Plant and Equipment – Property plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of property retired or sold and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the applicable accounts when disposition occurs and any gain or loss is recognized. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Useful lives for equipment, machinery and leasehold improvements range from three to seven years; for furniture and fixtures from five to ten years; and for buildings from 20 to 30 years.
 Reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. When an indication exists that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of those assets.
 55


Intangible Assets – Intangible assets are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, if the life is determinable. If the life is not determinable, amortization is not recorded. We regularly perform reviews to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful lives of our intangible assets are shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. When an indication exists that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of those assets. Patent costs consist primarily of legal and filing fees incurred to file patents on proprietary methods and technology developed by the Company. Patent costs are expensed when incurred as they are insignificant.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a charge for impairment of intangible assets in our former Solar segment.  See Note 9 for a description of the facts and circumstances leading to the intangible asset impairment charge.
 Goodwill - Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired.  Goodwill is not subject to amortization but are tested for impairment when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, typically at the end of the fiscal year, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. If it is concluded that there is a potential impairment, we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value (although the loss would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit).  Impairment tests include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we recorded a charge for impairment of goodwill in our former Solar segment.  See Note 10 for a description of the facts and circumstances leading to the goodwill impairment charge.
 Revenue Recognition – We adopted ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which created FASB Topic 606 (“ASC 606”) with a date of initial application of October 1, 2018.  Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a product or service to the customer. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based upon the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation and is recognized as revenue upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.
 We implemented ASC 606 using the modified retrospective approach with no cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained deficit. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Upon adoption of ASC 606, we changed our accounting policy for the installation performance obligation included in all solar system sales (now part of discontinued operations). Previously under ASC 605, we deferred revenue for the fair value of the installation and recognized it when earned. Under ASC 606, we no longer record a deferral but will continue to recognize the revenue when earned.  This change in policy does not result in a change in the amount of revenue recorded; instead, it removes the installation liability from our balance sheet.
 To achieve the core principle of the standard, we apply the following five steps:
 1) Identify the contract with the customer
 A contract with a customer exists when (i) the Company enters into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the related payment terms, (ii) the contract has commercial substance, and (iii) the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.
 56


2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract
 Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises to the customer in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
 Our equipment sales consist of multiple performance obligations, including the system itself and obligations that are not delivered simultaneously with the system, primarily installation services. Customers who purchase new systems are provided an assurance-type warranty, generally for periods of 12 to 24 months.  In accordance with ASC 606, assurance-type warranties are not considered a performance obligation.
 3) Determine the transaction price
 The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. The transaction price for equipment sales is adjusted for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon past return rates, which have historically been immaterial.  In rare cases when the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes.
 The transaction price for all transactions is based on the price reflected in the individual customer’s purchase order. Variable consideration has not been identified as a significant component of the transaction price for any of our transactions.
 The Company has determined that most contracts will be completed in less than one year.  For those transactions where all performance obligations will be satisfied within one year or less, the Company is applying the practical expedient outlined in ASC 606-10-32-18. This practical expedient allows the Company not to adjust promised consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects at contract inception the period between when the Company transfers the promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. For those transactions that are expected to be completed after one year, the Company has assessed that there are no significant financing components because any difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling price of the good or service is for reasons other than the provision of financing.
 The Company excludes from the transaction price all sales taxes that are assessed by a governmental authority and that are imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected from a customer (for example, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes). This employs the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-2A. Sales taxes are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
 4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract
 If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple distinct performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to each distinct performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation.
 57


Where required, the Company determines the SSP for each performance obligation based on consideration of both market and Company specific factors, including the selling price and profit margin for similar products.
 For those contracts that contain multiple performance obligations (primarily system sales requiring installation services), the Company must determine the SSP. To determine the SSP for labor related performance obligations (such as the labor component of installation), the Company uses directly observable inputs based on the standalone sale prices for these services. The Company uses a cost-plus margin approach in determining the SSP for any materials-related performance obligations (e.g., system add-ons, spare parts, and systems).
 5) Recognize revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation
 The Company satisfies performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either 1) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, 2) the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or 3) the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer. Examples of control are using the asset to produce goods or services, enhance the value of other assets, settle liabilities, and holding or selling the asset. For over time recognition, ASC 606 requires the Company to select a single revenue recognition method for the performance obligation that faithfully depicts the Company’s performance in transferring control of the goods and services. The guidance allows entities to choose between two methods to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation:
 Output methods - recognize revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract (e.g., surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed, and units of produced or units delivered); and
 Input methods - recognize revenue on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (e.g., resources consumed, labor hours expended, costs incurred, or time elapsed) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation.
 Equipment and related product revenues (e.g., furnace systems, system add-ons, machinery, consumables and spare parts) are recognized at a point in time, when they are shipped or delivered, depending on contractual terms.  For products where the customer’s defined specifications have not been met with at least two similarly configured systems and processes, the revenue and directly related costs are deferred at the time of shipment and later recognized at the time of customer acceptance or when this criterion has been met.
 For installation services, revenue is recognized at a point in time, once the installation of the tool is complete. The nature of the installation services are such that the customer does not simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, nor does performance of installation services create or enhance an asset that the customer controls. Installation services do not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity, and the entity does not have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
 Maintenance and service contracts are recognized over time. Progress in the satisfaction of these performance obligations will be measured using an input method of either time elapsed in the case of fixed period contracts, or labor hours expended, in the case of project-based contracts.
 58


Cost to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract with a Customer
 The Company recognizes an asset related to incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company will recognize an asset from costs incurred to fulfill a contract only if such costs relate directly to a contract that the entity can specifically identify, the costs generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future, and the costs are expected to be recovered. Any assets recognized related to costs to obtain or fulfill a contract are amortized to selling, general and administrative expense on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.
 In substantially all of our business transactions, we incur incremental costs to obtain contracts with customers, in the form of sales commissions. We maintain a commission program which rewards our sales representatives for system sales and our employees for system sales and other individual goals. Under ASC 606, an asset shall be amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. However, ASC 606 provides a practical expedient to allow for the recognition of commission expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. Based on the nature of the Company’s contracts with customers, we have elected this practical expedient and expense all commissions as incurred based upon the expectation that the amortization period would be one year or less.  
 The Company has also elected to adopt the practical expedient related to shipping and handling fees which allows the Company to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations.
 Revenue Categories used by Management
 Management reviews disaggregated revenue at the operating segment level. Revenue-generating transactions vary between our operating segments due to several factors.  For example, lead times vary among our operating segments and among our products. Most of the revenue for our SiC/LED segment results from the sale of consumables, rather than equipment sales.  These consumables have a much shorter production period than equipment produced by our other operating segments. Due to these variations between operating segments, management determined that disaggregated revenue by segment sufficiently depicts how economic factors affect the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows.  See Note 18 for additional information on our reportable business segments.
 Contract Assets – Contract assets consist of amounts the Company is not legally able to invoice but has completed the related performance obligation. These amounts generally arise from variances between the contractual payment terms and the transaction price assigned to the open performance obligations (e.g., the Company has recognized revenue in an amount greater than the amount that is billable under the contract). Contract assets are reflected in current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
 Contract Liabilities – Contract liabilities are reflected in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as all performance obligations are expected to be satisfied within the next 12 months. Contract liabilities include customer deposits and deferred profit.  Contract liabilities relate to payments invoiced or received in advance of completion of performance obligations under a contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue upon the fulfillment of performance obligations. This amount relates primarily to prepayments for system sales and installation services.
 Semiconductor system transactions have payment terms that generally require a payment due upon shipment of the system and a final payment due upon installation or acceptance. Automation transactions have payment terms that generally require a payment due upon shipment of the system, with a final payment due upon acceptance of the installation.
 59


Warranty – A limited warranty is provided free of charge, generally for periods of 12 to 24 months to all purchasers of our new products and systems. Accruals are recorded for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized, generally upon shipment or acceptance, as determined under the revenue recognition policy above. On occasion, we have been required and may be required in the future to provide additional warranty coverage to ensure that the systems are ultimately accepted or to maintain customer goodwill. While our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and we believe that the amounts accrued for warranty expenditures are sufficient for all systems sold through September 30, 2019, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience a similar level of predictability with regard to warranty costs. In addition, technological changes or previously unknown defects in raw materials or components may result in more extensive and frequent warranty service than anticipated, which could result in an increase in our warranty expense.
 The following is a summary of activity in accrued warranty expense at our continuing operations (in thousands):

Shipping Expense – Shipping expenses at our continuing operations of $0.7 million in each of the years 2019, 2018 and 2017 are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 Advertising Expense – Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  Advertising expenses at our continuing operations of $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
 Stock-Based Compensation – We measure compensation costs relating to share-based payment transactions based upon the grant-date fair value of the award. Those costs are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, with forfeitures recognized as they occur.  Prior to 2018, the expense recognized included an estimate for expected forfeitures, which was based upon historical experience.
 We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  The Black-Scholes model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life of the option and the risk-free interest rate.  A change in one or more of the assumptions used in the model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock-based compensation.
 Research, Development and Engineering Expenses – RD&E expenses consist of the cost of employees, consultants and contractors who design, engineer and develop new products and processes as well as materials, supplies and facilities used in producing prototypes.  Payments received for research and development grants prior to the meeting of milestones are recorded as unearned research and development grant liabilities and included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet.  When certain contract requirements are met, governmental research and development grants are netted against research, development and engineering expenses.  The following is a summary of our research, development and engineering expense (in thousands):

 | Years Ended September 30, | 
------------------------------------------+---------------------------+------

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation – We use the U.S. dollar as our reporting currency.  Our operations in Europe, China and other countries are primarily conducted in their functional currencies, the Euro, Renminbi, or the local country currency, respectively.  Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax - foreign currency translation adjustments as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Net foreign currency transaction gains/losses, including transaction gains/losses on intercompany balances that are not of a long-term investment nature and non-functional currency cash balances, are reported as a separate component of non-operating (income) expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
 Income Taxes – We file consolidated federal income tax returns in the United States for all subsidiaries except those in the Netherlands, France, Hong Kong and China, where separate returns are filed.  We compute deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon cumulative temporary differences between financial reporting and taxable income, carryforwards available and enacted tax laws.  We also accrue a liability for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that such tax will be incurred.
 Deferred tax assets reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management and based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Each quarter, the valuation allowance is re-evaluated. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we reversed a portion of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss carryforwards which we have determined will be utilized against net operating income in the current year. We will continue to monitor our cumulative income and loss positions in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to determine whether full valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets are appropriate.
 Concentrations of Credit Risk – Our customers consist of semiconductor and solar cell manufacturers worldwide, as well as the lapping and polishing marketplace. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. Credit risk is managed by performing ongoing credit evaluations of the customers’ financial condition, by requiring significant deposits where appropriate, and by actively monitoring collections. Letters of credit are required of certain customers depending on the size of the order, type of customer or its creditworthiness, and country of domicile.
 As of September 30, 2019, one Semiconductor customer individually represented 15% of accounts receivable.  As of September 30, 2018, one Semiconductor customer individually represented 16% of accounts receivable.
 We maintain our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in multiple financial institutions. Balances in the United States, which account for approximately 79% and 88% of total cash balances at our continuing operations as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are primarily invested in U.S. Treasuries or are in financial institutions insured by the FDIC. The remainder of our cash is maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit in the Netherlands, China, France, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Malaysia.  We maintain cash in bank accounts in amounts which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on such accounts.
 Refer to Note 20 for information regarding revenue and assets in other countries subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments – In accordance with the requirements of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, we group our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:
 Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted market price for identical instruments traded in active markets.
 Level 2 – Valuation is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.
 Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include use of discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.  
 61


In accordance with the requirements of the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC, it is our policy to use observable inputs whenever reasonably practicable in order to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, we use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, the fair value measurement is based on models that use primarily market-based parameters including interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and currency rates. In certain cases, where market rate assumptions are not available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use to estimate the fair value of a financial instrument. Changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future values.
 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash – Included in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are money market funds invested in treasury bills, notes and other direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury and foreign bank operating and time deposit accounts. The fair value of these accounts are based on Level 1 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.
 Receivables and Payables – The recorded amounts of these financial instruments, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate their fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
 Debt – The recorded amounts of these financial instruments, including long-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt, approximate fair value and are considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 See Note 4 for information on our adoption of ASC 606, which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material effect on our results of operations.
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash.” The amendments address diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. We adopted this standard retrospectively effective October 1, 2018, and, accordingly, to conform to the current period presentation, we reclassified our restricted cash to be included in the total of cash and cash equivalents presented at the bottom of our consolidated statements of cash flows for both the beginning and ending periods for fiscal years 2018 and 2017.  As a result, the amount of the change in our net cash provided by operating activities no longer separately shows the change in restricted cash for either period.
 The following table summarizes the effects related to the adoption of ASU 2016-18 for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017:
 
 
 | September 30, 2018 | | | September 30, 2017 |

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases,” which requires companies to generally recognize on the balance sheet operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use-assets (“ROU assets”). ASU 2016-02 also requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted.  We will adopt the standard as of October 1, 2019, the start of our fiscal 2020, and plan to utilize the retrospective cumulative effect adjustment transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment being recorded as of the adoption date.  We expect to elect certain available practical expedients including the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, will allow us to carry forward the historical lease classification.  Additionally, we will make an accounting policy election to not record ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less on our consolidated balance sheet.  
 We are in the process of finalizing the scope of arrangements that will be subject to this standard as well as assessing the impact to our systems, processes, and internal controls over financial reporting.  While we are still evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, we anticipate this standard will not have a material impact on our other assets and other liabilities balances until the effective date of our new lease at our SiC/LED segment.  The primary impact will be to record ROU assets and lease liabilities for existing operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets.  Currently, we estimate adoption of the standard will result in recognition of additional ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, as of October 1, 2019.  However, within the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we will record an additional $5.0 million of ROU assets and lease liabilities due to the commencement of our new SiC/LED building lease.
 We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or our consolidated statements of cash flows.  We do not believe the standard will have a notable impact on our liquidity.  The standard will have no impact on our debt-covenant compliance under our current agreements.  Our analysis and evaluation of the new standard will continue through its effective date in the first quarter of 2020, including continuing to monitor any potential changes in the standard proposed by the FASB.
 2.  Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
 In April 2019, we announced that the Board determined that it was in the long-term best interest of the Company to exit the solar business segment and focus our strategic efforts on our semiconductor and silicon carbide/polishing business segments in order to more fully realize the opportunities the Company believes are presented in those areas.
 The Board made its decision, effective March 28, 2019, after analyzing current market conditions and the strategic outlook for its Solar segment, which operates in a highly competitive market among lower cost manufacturers, particularly in China. Historical fluctuations in the solar cell industry combined with downward pricing pressure has negatively affected the Company’s results of operations in recent years. In response, we had been pursuing strategic alternatives for the continued operations of the Solar segment, including the possibility of restructuring the Solar segment to achieve profitability and compete more effectively. After further assessment, however (including input from management of the Solar segment and our external advisors), the Board determined that the investment required to return our solar business to profitability would be better utilized to pursue strategic opportunities in the Semiconductor and SiC/LED segments.
 The anticipated divestiture of our solar business included our Tempress and SoLayTec subsidiaries, which comprised substantially all of our Solar segment. We adopted a plan to sell our Solar operations on or before March 31, 2020.  As such, we classified substantially all of the Solar segment as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reported its results as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  We expect to incur one-time costs to sell Tempress of approximately $750,000, which includes $500,000 in broker fees and $250,000 in legal fees, although the final amount could be greater if certain timing and/or price targets are met.
 63


On June 7, 2019 (“Sale Date”), we completed the sale of our subsidiary, SoLayTec, to a third party located in the Netherlands.  Upon the Sale Date, we recognized a gain of approximately $1.6 million, which we included in loss from discontinued operations reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2019.  Also, effective on the Sale Date, SoLayTec is no longer included in our consolidated financial statements.  SoLayTec is not material to Amtech’s results of operations or financial position.
 Operating results of our discontinued solar operations were as follows, in thousands:

3.  Earnings Per Share & Diluted Earnings Per Share
 Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive common shares had been issued, and the numerator is based on net income. In the case of a net loss, diluted EPS is calculated in the same manner as basic EPS.
 For the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, options for 978,000, 434,000 and 1,364,000 weighted average shares, respectively, were excluded from the diluted EPS calculations because they were anti-dilutive.  These shares could become dilutive in the future.
 A reconciliation of the denominators of the basic and diluted EPS calculations follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):

5.  Operating Leases
 We have non-cancelable leases with third parties, primarily for administrative and manufacturing space, vehicles and equipment. Our facilities leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain renewal options.  We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Rental expense under such operating leases at our continuing operations was $0.5 million, $0.6 million, and $0.8 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and is included in either selling, general and administrative expenses or cost of goods sold, depending on the nature of the item under lease.
 As of September 30, 2019, future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more at our continuing operations are as follows, in thousands:

6.  Restructuring Plans
 The Company and its former Chief Executive Officer and President, Fokko Pentinga, agreed on a transition of leadership, pursuant to which Mr. Pentinga stepped down as the Chief Executive Officer, President and a director of the Company effective December 6, 2018 (the “Effective Date”). In connection with his departure, Mr. Pentinga and the Company entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release of all Claims, dated November 28, 2018 (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Mr. Pentinga received the following benefits:

• | a severance payment of $864,000 in gross, less all customary and appropriate income and employment taxes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a payment of $458,500 for all other amounts due him;
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 66


 
• | all of his time-based stock options (the “Options”) became fully vested and immediately exercisable. Mr. Pentinga has the right to exercise Options with an exercise price of $7.01 or less until December 31, 2019. The remaining Options were exercisable during the 90-day period following the Effective Date, which resulted in an additional $108,000 in stock-based compensation expense; and

In 2018, we conducted our periodic assessment of long-lived assets and identified the need for an intangible asset impairment charge in our Solar segment of $1.3 million due primarily to the decline in our expected performance of that segment.  All remaining intangible assets are included in our Semiconductor segment.  During 2019, we periodically assessed whether any indicators of impairment existed related to our intangible assets.  As of each interim period end during the year, we concluded that a triggering event had not occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of intangible assets below their carrying value.
 Amortization expense related to intangible assets at our continuing operations was $0.3 million, $(20,000) and $0.6 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The credit in 2018 was due to a one-time correction of previously recorded amortization expense.  Future amortization expense for the remaining unamortized balance as of September 30, 2019, is estimated as follows:
 
 
Years Ending September 30, | Amortization Expense |

During 2019, we periodically assessed whether any indicators of impairment existed which would require us to perform an interim impairment review.  As of each interim period end during the year, we concluded that a triggering event had not occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying values.  We performed our annual test of goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019.  The results of the first step of the goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of our Semiconductor reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value, and, thus, we did not require an impairment charge.  While the quantitative analysis indicated no impairment of Semiconductor segment goodwill existed as of September 30, 2019, if the future performance of this reporting unit falls short of our expectations or if there are significant changes in operations due to changes in market conditions, we could be required to recognize material impairment charges in future periods.  We performed a qualitative analysis of our SiC/LED segment, which indicted no impairment of SiC/LED segment goodwill existed as of September 30, 2019.
 In 2018, we identified the need for a goodwill impairment charge in our former Solar segment of $5.7 million, due primarily to the decline in our expected performance of that segment.  In 2019, we realigned our segments (see Note 18).

On June 7, 2019, we completed the sale of SoLayTec to a third party located in the Netherlands. Due to the tax treatment relating to the sale, we realized an income tax benefit of $1.3 million in our discontinued operations for the year ended September 30, 2019.
 The TCJA was enacted on December 22, 2017, and permanently reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminated corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, modified rules for expensing capital investment, and limits the deduction of interest expense for certain companies. The TCJA is a fundamental change to the taxation of multinational companies, including a shift from a system of worldwide taxation with some deferral elements to a territorial system, current taxation of certain foreign income, a minimum tax on low-tax foreign earnings, and new measures to curtail base erosion and promote U.S. production.
 As a result of the TCJA, the statutory rate applicable to our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 was 24.3%, based on a fiscal year blended rate calculation. ASC 740 requires filers to record the effect of tax law changes in the 
 69


period enacted. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we re-measured the applicable deferred tax assets based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse. We adjusted our gross deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded a corresponding offset to our full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, which resulted in minimal net effect to our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate.
 The TCJA includes a one-time mandatory repatriation transition tax on certain net accumulated earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries. We have analyzed the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries and determined that no transition taxes are due or expected.  The other provisions of TCJA are either immaterial or not applicable for the year ended September 30, 2018.

The deferred tax valuation allowance increased by $0.1 million and $0.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. We have established valuation allowances on substantially all net deferred tax assets, after considering all of the available objective evidence, both positive and negative, historical and prospective, with greater weight given to historical evidence, and determined it is not more likely than not that these assets will be realized.  In 2017, 2018 and 2019, we reversed a portion of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss carryforwards which we have determined will be utilized against net operating income in the current year.  Additionally, as of September 30, 2017, the deferred tax assets related to acquired foreign tax credits and the related valuation allowance were reduced due to our inability to use them prior to expiration.  We will continue to monitor our cumulative income and loss positions in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to determine whether full valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets are appropriate.
 As of September 30, 2019, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $13.8 million that expire at various times between 2028 and 2035. The utilization of those federal net operating losses are limited to approximately $0.8 million per year. Additionally, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $19.5 million that have an indefinite carryforward period. The utilization of those federal net operating losses are limited to 80% of taxable income. We have foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $38.4 million which expire at various times through 2025. We have approximately $12.6 million of state net operating loss carryforwards.
 We apply the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740. In this regard, an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return or planned to be taken in a future tax return, that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes. Approximately $0.6 million of this total represents the amount that, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective income tax rate in future periods.
 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of our unrecognized tax benefits is summarized as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 | Years Ended September 30, | 
-----------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+------
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | | 2017
Balance at beginning of the year | $ | 1,198 | | $ | 4,210 | | $ | 3,860
Additions related to tax positions taken in prior years | | 74 | | | 155 | | | 350 
Reductions due to resolution of uncertain tax position | | — | | | (3,167 | ) | | — 
Balance at the end of the year | $ | 1,272 | | $ | 1,198 | | $ | 4,210

 
We have classified all of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions as income taxes payable long-term.  Income taxes long-term also includes other items, primarily withholding taxes that are not due until the related intercompany service fees are paid.
 We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  We recognized a net expense (benefit) for interest and penalties of $0.1 million, $(2.0) million and $0.4 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Income taxes payable long-term on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes a cumulative accrual for potential interest and penalties of $0.8 million and $0.7 million as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 We do not expect that the amount of our tax reserves for uncertain tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months other than the continued accrual of interest and penalties.

Amtech and one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the Netherlands, Germany, France, China and other foreign jurisdictions, as well as the U.S. and various states in the U.S.  We have not signed any agreements with the Internal Revenue Service, any state or foreign jurisdiction to extend the statute of limitations for any fiscal year.  As such, the number of open years is the number of years dictated by statute in each of the respective taxing jurisdictions, but generally is from 3 to 5 years.
 These open years contain certain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, timing, or inclusion of revenues and expenses, or the sustainability of income tax positions of Amtech and our subsidiaries.
 12.  Long-Term Debt
 Continuing Operations
 We have a mortgage note secured by BTU’s real property in Billerica, Massachusetts.  The note has a remaining balance of $5.5 million as of September 30, 2019 and a maturity date of September 26, 2023. The debt was refinanced in September 2016 with an interest rate of 4.11% through September 26, 2021, at which time the interest rate will be adjusted to a per annum fixed rate equal to the aggregate of the Federal Home Loan Board Five Year Classic Advance Rate plus two hundred forty basis points.
 From time to time, we enter into capital leases for certain manufacturing or IT equipment.  Our obligations under capitalized leases are included in long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2019 and 2018.

 In 2017, Tempress borrowed approximately $0.4 million as part of the construction of a large, bi-facial solar PV park at its headquarters in the Netherlands.  The debt is secured by Tempress’ real property in Vaassen, the Netherlands, and carries an interest rate equal to the 10-year interest rate swap rate plus a 2.4% premium, reduced by a 1% discount, which at September 30, 2019 was 2.23%.  The debt has a 15-year term.  As of September 30, 2019, Tempress’ remaining debt balance is $0.3 million.
 13.  Equity and Stock-Based Compensation
 2017 Equity Offering
 On August 18, 2017, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC, as underwriter (the “Underwriter”), relating to a firm commitment underwritten offering (the “Offering”) of 1,055,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $9.50 per share, and granted the Underwriter an option to purchase up to 158,250 additional shares (the “Over-Allotment Option”) of our common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. On August 23, 2017, we and the Underwriter closed the Offering and the Underwriter exercised its Over-Allotment Option at the closing. As a result, we issued a total of 1,213,250 shares of our common stock at a price of $9.50 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $10.6 million from the Offering. We plan to use the net proceeds of the Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions.

2018 Stock Repurchase Plan
 On March 28, 2018, we announced that our Board approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $4 million of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.01, over a one-year period, commencing on April 2, 2018.  During the year ended September 30, 2018, we completed our repurchase program and repurchased 771,149 shares of our common stock on the open market at a total cost of approximately $4.0 million (an average price of $5.19 per share).  All shares repurchased during the year ended September 30, 2018, have been retired.
2019 Stock Repurchase Plan
 On November 29, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $4 million of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.01 per share, over a one-year period. Repurchases under the program will be made in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means in compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC; however, we have no obligation to repurchase shares and the timing, actual number, and value of shares to be repurchased is subject to management’s discretion and will depend on the Company’s stock price and other market conditions. Our Board may terminate the repurchase program at any time while it is in effect. We intend to retire any repurchased shares. As of September 30, 2019, there have been no shares repurchased under this repurchase plan.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
 Stock-based compensation expenses of $0.6 million, $0.9 million and $1.3 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of September 30, 2019, total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized is $0.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 1.64 years on a weighted-average basis.
 Amtech Equity Compensation Plans
 The 2007 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”), under which 500,000 shares could be granted, was adopted by our Board of Directors in April 2007, and approved by the shareholders in May 2007. The 2007 Plan was amended in 2009, 2014 and 2015 to add 2,500,000 shares.  The plan was also amended in 2019 to extend the term of the plan and allow for the grant of restricted stock units.
 The Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan was approved by the shareholders in 1996 for issuance of up to 100,000 shares of common stock to directors. The Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan was amended in 2005, 2009 and 2014 to add 400,000 shares.
 Equity compensation plans as of September 30, 2019 are summarized in the table below:

Stock Options
 Stock options issued under the terms of the plans have, or will have, an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of the common stock at the date of the option grant and expire no later than 10 years from the date of grant. Options issued under the plans vest over 6 months to 4 years. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions:

The aggregate intrinsic values of options outstanding and options exercisable as of September 30, 2019 were $182,000 and $164,000, respectively, which represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on our closing stock price of $5.30 per share as of September 30, 2019, the last business day of our fiscal year, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $0.1 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.
 14.  Benefit Plans
 We have retirement plans covering substantially all employees. The principal plans are the multi-employer defined benefit pension plans of our operations in the Netherlands and France, the multi-employer plan for hourly union employees in Pennsylvania and our defined contribution plan that covers substantially all of our employees in the United States.  The multi-employer plans in the United States and France as well as the defined contribution plan are insignificant.
 Pensions – Our employees in the Netherlands, 75 at September 30, 2019, participate in a multi-employer pension plan Pensioenfonds Metaal en Techniek (“PMT”), determined in accordance with the collective bargaining agreements effective for the industry in the Netherlands. The collective bargaining agreement has no expiration date. This multi-employer pension plan covers approximately 34,000 companies and 1.4 million participants. Amtech’s contribution to the multi-employer pension plan is less than 5.0% of the total contributions to the plan. The plan monitors its risks on a global basis, not by company or employee, and is subject to regulation by Dutch governmental authorities. By law (the Dutch Pension Act), a multi-employer pension plan must be monitored against specific criteria, including the coverage ratio of the plan assets to its obligations. This coverage ratio must exceed 104.3% for the total plan. Every company participating in a Dutch multi-employer union plan contributes a premium calculated as a percentage of its total pensionable salaries, with each company subject to the same percentage contribution rate. The premium can fluctuate yearly based on the coverage ratio of the multi-employer union plan. The pension rights of each employee are based upon the employee’s average salary during employment, the years of service, and the participant’s age at the time of retirement.
 Our net periodic pension cost for this multi-employer pension plan for any period is the amount of the required contribution for that period. A contingent liability may arise from, for example, possible actuarial losses relating to other participating entities because each entity that participates in a multi-employer union plan shares in the actuarial risks of every other participating entity or any responsibility under the terms of a plan to finance any shortfall in the plan if other entities cease to participate
 The coverage ratio of the Dutch multi-employer union plan is 94.6% as of September 30, 2019. In 2013, PMT prepared and executed a “Recovery Plan” which was approved by De Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, which is the supervisor of all pension companies in the Netherlands. As a result of the Recovery Plan, the pension rights decreased 6.3% in April 2013 and the employer’s premium percentage increased to 16.6% of pensionable wages. The coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the plan assets by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based on actual market interest.  The coverage ratio of PMT fluctuates during a year due to the changes in the value of the assets and the present value of the liabilities. During the fiscal year 2019, the coverage ratio was as high as 101.9% in the first quarter and as low as 92.6% in the fourth quarter. The fluctuations are due to the reduction in the ultimate forward rate (which increases the present value of the liabilities) and a decrease in the value of global equities. As of September 30, 2019, PMT’s total plan assets were $94.2 billion and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits was $99.7 billion.
 Below is a table of our contributions to multi-employer pension plans (in thousands):
 
 
 | Years Ended September 30, | 
---------------------------------+---------------------------+----
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | | 2017
Pensioenfonds Metaal en Techniek | $ | 658 | | $ | 897 | | $ | 805
Other plans | | 158 | | | 188 | | | 188
Total | $ | 816 | | $ | 1,085 | | $ | 993

 
75


Defined Contribution Plans – We match employee contributions to our defined contribution plans on a discretionary basis.  The match was $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 15.  Commitments and Contingencies
 Purchase Obligations – As of September 30, 2019, we had unrecorded purchase obligations at our continuing operations in the amount of $4.4 million. These purchase obligations consist of outstanding purchase orders for goods and services. While the amount represents purchase agreements, the actual amounts to be paid may be less in the event that any agreements are renegotiated, canceled or terminated.
 Legal Proceedings and Other Claims – From time to time, we are a party to claims and actions for matters arising out of our business operations. We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings and other claims in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss, or an additional loss, may have been incurred and determine if accruals are appropriate. If accruals are not appropriate, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of possible loss can be made for disclosure. Although the outcome of claims and litigation is inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in any particular period by the resolution of a claim or legal proceeding. Legal expenses related to defense, negotiations, settlements, rulings and advice of outside legal counsel are expensed as incurred.
 In December 2018, we were notified by our customer that the turnkey contract for Phase II has been terminated. As a result, we will not perform the final installation and integration of our equipment under such contract. Negotiations did not result in a final settlement, and the customer has notified us of their intention to pursue arbitration. We have removed the value of this remaining work from our backlog with no material effect on financial condition and results of operations.
 Employment Contracts – We have employment contracts with, and severance plans covering, certain officers and management employees under which severance payments would become payable in the event of specified terminations without cause or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in control. If severance payments under the current employment agreements or plan payments were to become payable, the severance payments would generally range from twelve to thirty-six months of salary.
16.  Divestitures
 SoLayTec
 On December 24, 2014, we acquired a 51% controlling interest in SoLayTec, which provides ALD systems used in high efficiency solar cells, for a total purchase price consideration of $1.9 million.  On July 31, 2017, Tempress entered into an Exit Agreement (the “Agreement”) with the two minority owners of SoLayTec (“Minority Owners”) to acquire their remaining shares of SoLayTec, resulting in Tempress becoming the sole owner of SoLayTec. The terms of the Agreement, which was effective as of July 1, 2017, state that the Minority Owners will sell all of their SoLayTec shares to Tempress for a nominal fee and waive all right to future repayment of principal and interest on loans payable to the Minority Owners. As a result of the effectiveness of the Agreement, SoLayTec has no further liability under the loans. The amount of principal and interest forgiven was approximately $2.4 million, which was recorded as a capital contribution, with no impact on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The carrying value of the non-controlling interest at the date of the Agreement was $2.7 million.  Under our previously announced plan to exit our solar business (see Note 2), on June 7, 2019 (“Sale Date”), we completed the sale of SoLayTec to a third party located in the Netherlands.  Upon the Sale Date, we recognized a gain of approximately $1.6 million, which we included in loss from discontinued operations reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2019.  Effective on the Sale Date, SoLayTec is no longer included in our consolidated financial statements.  SoLayTec is not material to Amtech’s results of operations or financial position.
 76


Kingstone
 On September 16, 2015, we reduced our ownership to 15% in Kingstone Hong Kong. Our investment in Kingstone Hong Kong was accounted for using the equity method for periods subsequent to the deconsolidation due to our ability to exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of Kingstone Hong Kong, primarily through our representation on the board of directors. The resulting equity method investment was initially recorded at fair value at $2.7 million using the value the third-party purchaser placed on their investment in Kingstone Shanghai. The carrying value of the equity method investment in Kingstone Hong Kong was $2.6 million as of September 30, 2017.
 Effective June 29, 2018, we sold our remaining ownership interest in Kingstone Hong Kong to the majority owner for approximately $5.7 million, which was received in August 2018.  We recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.9 million, which is reported as gain on sale of other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2018.
 17.  Related Party Transactions
 Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Parties are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or significant influence, such as a family member or relative, shareholder, or a related corporation.
 In 2015, we deconsolidated Kingstone, reducing our ownership to 15% of Kingstone Hong Kong.  Effective June 29, 2018, we sold our remaining 15% ownership interest in Kingstone Hong Kong to the majority owner for approximately $5.7 million.  We recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $2.9 million.  The 2018 gain is reported as a gain on sale of other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Kingstone Hong Kong and its owners are no longer related parties of Amtech.
 As of June 30, 2017, SoLayTec had borrowed approximately $2.4 million, including accrued interest, from its minority shareholders.  These loans were forgiven as part of the Exit Agreement entered into in July 2017.  See Note 16 for additional information.  SoLayTec and its owners are no longer related parties of Amtech.
 18.  Business Segments
 After announcing the planned divestiture of our Solar segment (see Note 2), we conducted an evaluation of our organizational structure. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we made changes to our reportable segments. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period segment reporting structure.
 Our three reportable segments are as follows:
 Semiconductor–We design, manufacture, sell and service thermal processing equipment and related controls for use by leading semiconductor manufacturers, and in electronics, automotive and other industries.
 SiC/LED–We produce consumables and machinery for lapping (fine abrading) and polishing of materials, such as sapphire substrates, optical components, silicon wafers, numerous types of crystal materials, ceramics and metal components. We formerly referred to our SiC/LED segment as “Polishing.”
 Automation–We are a leading supplier of solar and semiconductor automation with in-house design and manufacturing capabilities and offer a full array of single wafer transfer tools as well as batch transfer tools and stocker options.

23. Subsequent Events
 
In November 2019, we completed the sale of our subsidiary, R2D, to certain members of R2D’s management team.  We will recognize a loss of approximately $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2020 and R2D will no longer be included in our consolidated financial statements.
