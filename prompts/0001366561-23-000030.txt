Item 1. Business
Overview
We are the enterprise platform for modern work management, enabling teams and organizations of all sizes to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale, resulting in more efficient processes and better business outcomes. 
Smartsheet was founded in 2005 with a vision to build a universal software platform for managing work that does not require coding capabilities. We are different than many enterprise IT systems that require heavier IT implementation and management. Business users need technology solutions they can set up and modify on their own. Our platform empowers teams of all sizes to create custom processes, programs, and portfolios that fit the way they work. It serves as a single source of truth, integrating with the other tools teams are using, which empowers accountability and engagement, ultimately leading to more efficient decision-making and better business outcomes. We provide solutions that eliminate the obstacles to capturing information, propelled by a familiar and intuitive interface as well as easily customizable forms. Our reporting and automation capabilities reduce time spent on administration and repetitive work. We make it easy for teams to apply business logic to automate repetitive actions using an extensive list of conditions. Business users, with little or no training, can set up and modify our platform to customize workflows to suit their needs. Our familiar and intuitive user interface and functionality allow users to realize the benefits of our platform without changing the behaviors developed using everyday productivity tools. 
People across organizations have similar responsibilities no matter where they work or what they do. They need to manage workflows across teams; gain visibility into progress on company-wide programs, processes, and portfolios in real-time; capture inputs; track and report on deliverables; prioritize actions; and provide consistency in processes. Smartsheet is adaptable to manage virtually any type of work. Our customers use Smartsheet for thousands of documented use cases, including software migration planning, vendor and contract management, brand launches, compliance reporting, event planning, customer onboarding, budget approvals, patent application processing, talent acquisition management, benefit and retirement tracking, sales enablement, pipeline management, sales operations, commissions calculations, marketing programs management, investor relations tracking, and website management, among others.
Our customers are in approximately 190 countries and include 90 companies in the Fortune 100, and over 80% of the companies in the Fortune 500. As of January 31, 2023, our Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 customers had annualized contract values (“ACVs”) ranging from less than $200 to over $4.0 million. Our customers typically begin using our platform for a single initiative, process, or project. Over time, as users realize the benefits of improved execution, adoption of our platform expands horizontally across an organization through new use cases and teams, as well as expands vertically to increasingly sophisticated and mission-critical uses.
We have a blended go-to-market model that allows us to serve a larger, diverse user base without incurring excessive costs. We deliver our cloud-based software platform through a subscription model globally. Our digital sales model enables self-service licensing and adoption through our website. We employ an efficient inside sales team that utilizes machine learning and lead scoring to respond to and convert other interested users within new and existing organizations. We have a targeted field sales team dedicated to expanding our presence within existing enterprise customers where we have identified significant opportunity for growth. We have developed partner relationships to support new customers, use cases, and markets. The breadth of solutions we offer reflects the flexibility our users desire to purchase and use our platform in a way that most closely aligns with their needs and level of adoption.

Our Platform
Our platform is purpose-built to transform work execution for organizations and teams of all sizes. It is designed to scale up to the most demanding enterprise-grade work management needs and delivers the scalability, compliance, and security required by the world’s largest organizations. We provide our customers with a robust set of capabilities to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale - from an individual project to thousands of concurrently running projects, programs, and portfolios. Our platform enhances visibility and accountability in work execution and eliminates behaviors and processes that hinder productivity. It is designed to be accessible and valuable to all managers and their team members and stakeholders. Business users with no coding ability can share their work in Smartsheet across internal and external teams, and create and modify workflows to address specific use cases. Our platform offers multiple ways for our users to plan and manage their work using tables, plans, projects, cards, Gantt charts, and calendars, and users can easily toggle between views to support their team’s preferred way of working. The integration of the Smartsheet platform, Brandfolder digital asset management, and Outfit allows customers to align marketing and creative work with templatizing scale to seamlessly manage campaigns from ideation to launch, and measurement all in one place.
We also offer capabilities and functionality to enable teams to accelerate execution while maintaining the flexibility to apply our platform to thousands of documented use cases. Smartsheet Advance provides components that enable customers to implement solutions for a specific use case or for large scale projects, initiatives, or processes. These components include Control Center, Dynamic View, Data Shuttle, Connectors, and Bridge by Smartsheet (“Bridge”). These components deliver on the sophisticated needs of our customers to provision and manage thousands of projects with consistency and repeatability, to integrate data from third-party systems, and to build more complex automations. Certain components are available for standalone purchase and are monetized based on the value they create for customers, not on a per seat basis.
Customers can add additional subscriptions, such as Resource Management by Smartsheet (“Resource Management”), a resource planning solution that helps businesses find and schedule appropriate project teams, track and manage time, and forecast hiring needs; and Brandfolder, a digital asset management platform with templatizing scale that enables workers to intuitively store, customize, and share digital assets.
Benefits of our Platform
Ease of use enables broad adoption
Our platform is designed for broad adoption within and across organizations for virtually any use case. Users can begin using Smartsheet within minutes and configure our platform for their needs with limited or no training. As of January 31, 2023, we had over 12 million Smartsheet users. Our strategy is designed to monetize those seeking to enjoy the complete functionality of our platform or to enjoy tailored experiences while promoting greater usage within and across organizations. Teams and organizations buy into our platform because the productivity benefits derived through visibility, accountability, repeatability, and continuous improvement are provided to all stakeholders. All team members can access the latest project information from a single location and can be held accountable without manual effort.
Enterprise features and functionality for scalable adoption within businesses
Organizations rely on Smartsheet to manage a diverse set of business processes. We provide the scalability, compliance, and security needed to operate reliably for our customers. Our platform provides consistent execution, enabling teams and organizations to administer programs, processes, and portfolios with management, visibility, and reporting at scale. Our professional services offerings help customers to create and administer programs for specific use cases. We also provide user management and compliance features to control user access and audit account activity within our platform. We provide enterprise-grade security controls and data governance to enable customer compliance with applicable privacy regulations and data handling requirements.

Automation across the organization saves time and minimizes manual processing
We enable users to organize their work and apply business logic to automate actions that shorten work execution timelines without the need to write code. Business logic is used to determine the conditions under which the following types of automated actions occur: update requests, intake and collection of information, distribution of information, notifications, approval requests, and automated actions across systems. This automation reduces errors and time spent by teams on administration.
Real-time visibility drives more informed, faster decision-making
Our platform is designed to provide a single source of truth for all stakeholders. We break down information silos across teams and provide real-time visibility into the status of work and the actions required by each stakeholder. Teams feel empowered to take action, leading to stronger engagement and faster time to completion. Managers benefit from visibility into progress against goals, allowing them to react quickly to real-time information and enabling faster and more informed decision-making.
Content collaboration produces better content, faster
We enable marketing, creative, and other functional teams to easily manage creative production and marketing work, as well as review, deliver, store, share, design, templatize, manipulate, and analyze the content they produce across hundreds of formats. We help global brands create compelling, timely, and consistent brand experiences. 
Multiple levels of integration to garner the most benefit from Smartsheet and other systems
We enable business users to engage with our platform through systems they currently use. Through Connectors either built by Smartsheet or developed in collaboration with our partners, we extend the reach and consistency of data from other systems, such as those offered by Salesforce, Adobe, UiPath, Workday, DocuSign, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Microsoft. Smartsheet components, Bridge and Data Shuttle, enable customers to connect Smartsheet with most other systems for enhanced reach and cross system data consistency. Our platform, coupled with these capabilities, applies business logic and automates workflows, adding value to our users. We also integrate our platform into popular document and communication applications such as those from Google, Microsoft, and Slack. This enables our users to incorporate documents directly into our platform or access our platform through the application of their choice. We also offer extensible application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that enable a broad ecosystem of partners and customers to integrate directly into our platform, increasing the value of existing custom-built applications and improving the experience for our users.
Our Growth Strategies
Our goal is to make our platform accessible for every organization, team, and worker relying on collaborative work to achieve successful outcomes. 
Attract more customers to Smartsheet
We believe that there is a broad need for a collaborative work management platform such as ours, and we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our paid user base. We will continue to invest in our digital sales model, direct sales force, brand, product, and partner marketing to land new customers and increase enterprise adoption. We also will continue to grow our professional services function, and develop new and enhanced premium solutions based on Smartsheet Advance and our standalone offerings to land larger accounts and increase the scale of our deployments with customers.

Expand within our existing customer base
Our customers frequently increase their use of our platform as they realize the value they derive from adopting Smartsheet. As a result, we work with customers to help them define new use cases within existing deployments, and expand usage of Smartsheet to additional teams in their organizations that would benefit from our platform. In addition to broader deployments, we enable our customers to enhance the value they derive from Smartsheet through premium capabilities such as Data Shuttle, Control Center, Dynamic View, and Bridge. Our professional services, customer success, and training teams provide our customers with implementation, training, and support services to help them expand their use of, and realize the full benefit of, Smartsheet.
Expand internationally
For the year ended January 31, 2023, we derived approximately 16% of our revenue from customers outside the United States. We believe that there is significant opportunity to acquire new customers internationally and accelerate expansion with our existing international customers. Our platform is available in eight languages. We plan to further grow our international sales by continuing to invest in our direct and indirect sales force focused outside of the United States, establishing international sales territories, and partnering with strategic resellers. We have opened international offices in the U.K. and Australia to focus on expanding our position in Western Europe and the Australia/APAC regions, respectively. We also launched Smartsheet Regions and host data in the European Union to meet customer compliance, privacy, and governance requirements. In November 2021, we established an operations center in Costa Rica to support various functions within the Company.
Expand into government
Smartsheet Gov has achieved Provisional Authority to Operate (“P-ATO”) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”). This means the Smartsheet platform has been approved for use by federal agencies and government contractors, giving them the ability to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale. Additionally, Smartsheet can be found on the AWS Gov Cloud Marketplace. This marketplace lists FedRAMP authorized offerings to help agencies research and select secure and compliant cloud providers available for federal use. Smartsheet Gov has obtained the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) Impact Level 4 P-ATO per the Security Requirements Guide for cloud computing by the Defense Information Systems Agency. This means that customers within the DoD can also use the Smartsheet Gov platform for managing work that requires DoD Impact Level 4 security controls.
Expand product features and functionality
We intend to increase the value we provide to our customers by investing in extending the capabilities of our platform. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to bolster our existing technology and enhance usability to improve our customers’ productivity. We further place continued emphasis on enterprise management platform features, including account administration, security, and permissioning.
Make additional investments in partnerships and integrations
To help drive adoption of Smartsheet and deliver value to our customers, we offer extensive embedded functionality to complement and enhance the use of the most common productivity tools from providers such as Microsoft, Google, Slack, Box, DocuSign, and Dropbox. We offer powerful out-of-the-box integrations with Salesforce, Adobe, Atlassian, and Microsoft that we sell for an additional fee on top of our user-based pricing. We intend to continue to invest in such integrations and develop new partnerships with leading enterprise vendors to increase the value, awareness, and adoption of our platform.

Pursue strategic acquisitions
We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe complement our existing offering, enhance our technology, and increase our value proposition. For example, our acquisitions of Brandfolder and Outfit complemented our existing product capabilities. Brandfolder offered a solution for digital asset management so that our customers can create solutions to manage workflows around content and collaboration. Outfit’s design automation and templating capabilities extended the content experience for Brandfolder customers. 
Our Technology
We believe our collective domain knowledge, technical expertise, and extensive software development experience differentiates our platform from the competition. Our scalable multi-tenant architecture provides our customers with highly usable, secure, and reliable functionality.
Extensible technology platform
Our solutions are built on a public cloud platform that allows us to leverage shared components and services, enabling us to rapidly develop new features and functionalities. This also enables our products to seamlessly integrate with one another and provide our customers with a better user experience while leveraging our platform. We also offer a broad set of APIs that allow our customers and partners to integrate with other systems, or build their own applications on top of our extensible platform.
Integrated mobile capabilities
We have invested in our public cloud framework and mobile development teams to extend the high-performance functionality of our platform to smartphones and tablets. Our native mobile applications are built for both iOS and Android, and are designed to provide mobile optimized functionality of our platform while also supporting mobile-first use cases.
Enterprise-Grade Security 
Our customers frequently use our platform to store and manage highly sensitive or proprietary information. We prioritize security in every aspect of our service, from software development to the customer experience. Our approach to security includes a comprehensive information security program, governing the processing and security of customer information, and the appropriate physical, organizational, and technical controls designed to ensure the security of customer information collected, accessed, stored, or transmitted to or by Smartsheet. We use external auditors to verify the adequacy of security measures and controls according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants SOC2 standards as well as the International Organization for Standardization information security management systems standard 27001. At least annually, we use external security experts to conduct penetration testing and application security testing and make these test reports available to customers. In parallel, Smartsheet takes a global approach to privacy that aligns with international standards and practices for data processing and recognized privacy principles. Our privacy notice describes how Smartsheet collects, uses, and discloses personal and other information we gather through our websites, our mobile applications, and the Smartsheet collaborative work management platform. Smartsheet is committed to respecting privacy rights and treating personal data with the utmost care.
Our Products
Smartsheet
The Smartsheet product is the core of our offerings to customers.

WorkApps
WorkApps enables customers to build user-friendly apps in a few minutes using Smartsheet and external content without writing a single line of code. WorkApps is designed to support a broad range of business workflows and can be tailored to support multiple user roles. Building WorkApps is restricted to specific Smartsheet plan types.
Smartsheet Advance
In addition to our core Smartsheet offering we sell additional product offerings, collectively referred to as Premium Apps and Connectors, so customers can build more complex solutions to address the most demanding business work management needs, while enabling scale and connections to systems of record across the enterprise.
Previously sold only as standalone offerings, based on customer feedback we launched Smartsheet Advance, which combines our Premium Apps and Connectors with new Smartsheet capabilities in packages that match our customers’ solution maturity. Customers can start with an entry level Advance package to enable high-scale solutions to manage portfolios, programs, and projects. They can then move to a different Advance tier to connect to other systems of record and orchestrate work management across the enterprise as well as add data governance and advanced security capabilities to Smartsheet solutions.
Connectors
Connectors provide embedded integrations with industry-leading systems of record, including those from Salesforce, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Microsoft. Connectors enable data to be synchronized in real-time, fostering visibility and interoperability across these business platforms. We also provide extensible APIs to build custom applications and deep integrations with line of business systems.
Control Center
Control Center enables organizations to achieve consistent work execution at the individual user level across large scale programs, projects, and portfolios while reducing operational risk. Control Center provides enterprises with real-time visibility so they can react quickly to changing conditions. Without burdening the team with manual reporting, executives and managers can review the status of projects at scale without disrupting the speed of execution.
Dynamic View
Dynamic View enables business users to collaborate using the same data set while maintaining confidentiality when working with vendors or across inter- or intra-departmental teams. This solution simplifies views into complex processes so each individual stakeholder has a partial view of the overall work. Dynamic View is ideal for managing departmental requests like business intelligence requests, marketing creative services, and sales tickets.
Data Shuttle
Data Shuttle allows business users to upload or offload data between Smartsheet and other existing systems and databases, so that a team’s key data sources live together where work gets done. Data Shuttle automates the data upload process to centralize the disparate data, drive collaboration, provide real-time visibility into multiple business systems, and empower teams to be more efficient through effective work execution.
Bridge
Bridge enables organizations to build intelligent workflows and automate business processes across platforms. Bridge's no-code user interface makes it easy to apply business logic to data-driven actions that reduce time spent on manual and repetitive tasks and drive overall efficiency and accuracy.

Calendar App
Calendar App extends customer capabilities beyond those of the calendar view included in Smartsheet’s core offering. Calendar App is a flexible, configurable calendar add-on that allows customers to build shareable calendars with custom details. Customers can create, update, and discuss events directly from the Calendar App.
Pivot App
Pivot App enables customers to create Smartsheet pivot tables to analyze data and make better decisions, faster. Pivot App slices and dices data to create meaningful summary sheets, and enables creation of charts in dashboards with report data. Smartsheet pivot tables update summary sheets as data changes, helping customers access and organize their data quickly.
DataMesh
DataMesh provides lookup functionality between sheets and reports, making it easy to keep data consistent. DataMesh helps customers scale work in Smartsheet by eliminating typos, duplicative data entry, and unnecessary work.
Resource Management
Resource Management enables businesses to plan and allocate resources across their programs, projects, and portfolios. Users can optimize resource allocation by function or skill set, track time against forecast, and gain real-time portfolio level visibility into the status of budgets and deliverables. This premium solution combined with the core Smartsheet platform provides customers an end-to-end solution for work execution and resource management that balances top down strategic planning with bottom up work management.
Brandfolder
Brandfolder is a digital asset management solution that provides a centralized platform to easily organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. Brandfolder provides insights and analyses on the discoverability and reusability of assets throughout the entire content lifecycle for internal and external stakeholders. Combining Brandfolder’s digital asset management capabilities with the core Smartsheet platform through a robust integration creates a dynamic solution for customers to manage workflows around content and collaboration.
Human Capital
At Smartsheet, our mission is to empower anyone to drive meaningful change. This starts with our own team. 
As of January 31, 2023 Smartsheet and its wholly owned subsidiaries employed 3,191 people full time, with 2,676 in the United States and 515 internationally. Of the 515 international employees, 280 are located in Europe, 130 in Asia Pacific, and 105 in Americas other than the United States. Furthermore, of our global workforce who chose to self-identify as of January 31, 2023, 68% identify as White, 17% identify as Asian, 7% identify as Hispanic or Latino, 6% identify as Black, <1% Alaska Native or Native American or Indigenous, <1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 1% identify as two or more races. Further, 38% are women, 62% are men, and <1% identify as other genders (including genderqueer, intersex, transgender, and gender fluid). None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be positive. 
Our leadership team is composed of seven executive officers, 14% of whom are women and 43% of whom are persons of color. Leadership regularly updates our board of directors (“Board”) and its committees on the operation and status of overall human capital trends and the employee-focused activities and initiatives of the Company.

Engaging our team 
With a vision to be the dynamic platform to empower everyone, everywhere, to change the way the world works, we are dedicated to investing in and supporting our employees in their achievements.
To ensure we are continuously improving, we regularly conduct surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, leadership effectiveness and company confidence, competitiveness of our total rewards offerings, career growth opportunities, and work-life balance. 
Starting with the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, we transitioned to remote work to safeguard the health of our employees, their families, our customers, and the community at large. While we temporarily closed our physical offices in 2020, we ensured our workforce was enabled to work remotely beyond these initial closures. Now, using Smartsheet to enable collaborative work across geographic locations, we continue to operate in a hybrid capacity, which also allows us to expand our talent pool and give employees flexibility in how they work. 
Growth and development
To help our team members succeed, we continually emphasize and invest in talent development and training, provide career pathing, and promote internal mobility opportunities. 
Along with an online learning management system that hosts virtual content ranging from compliance training to security protocols, we subscribe to multiple platforms for continuous learning and professional development, and offer instructor-led training on topics such as leadership and communication. We also support the development of our people leaders through various leadership training opportunities and access to certified coaches. Finally, our talent management cycle includes regular check-ins to encourage more frequent conversations between employees and their leaders regarding their development and career opportunities, as well as to enable and support internal mobility readiness.
Total rewards
We invest in our employees by offering compelling and competitive compensation packages designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward. Our total rewards packages include base and variable compensation, new hire and retentive stock awards for all eligible roles, an employee stock purchase plan in most jurisdictions, and comprehensive benefits. Our benefit programs are responsive to our geographies, while also providing a consistent focus on comprehensive healthcare. Examples of global benefits include bonding leave for all parents, flexible time away for exempt employees in addition to numerous paid holidays, a monthly flex work stipend and additional commuter support, employer retirement contributions, and subsidized dependent care. We continually assess the current business environment and labor markets and solicit employee feedback as we work to refine our total rewards packages and ensure they remain compelling and equitable. 
We view well-being as a fundamental part of our employees’ lives, and emphasize this with a robust suite of offerings. We support holistic well-being with our online mental health counseling and well-being services, financial wellness workshops, and a comprehensive wellness dashboard (powered by Smartsheet), which includes resources for employees on a wide range of topics. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion 
We strive to create a culture of belonging that is rooted in respect and opportunity for all people. We believe that by celebrating diverse voices and experiences, and fostering equity for our team, customers, and communities, we enable people to do and be their best. 
Table of Contents

Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) framework centers on culture, people, practices, and markets. Our strategy and initiatives are led by our Vice President of DEI. In addition, we have several working committees, including our Global DEI Committee, which brings together a cross section of the global organization to support and amplify our DEI initiatives, as well as department-specific groups such as our DEI in Marketing Committee. We continue to invest in hiring practices that attract underrepresented talent, including focused sourcing of underrepresented populations on university campuses, specialized conferences, and organizations. We also offer ongoing DEI education at all levels and strive to ensure that we have diverse representation in various aspects, from hiring panels to company meetings and events. 
Further, we have seven employee resource groups (“ERGs”) whose aim is to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace, including Asian Pacific Islander at Smartsheet, Black at Smartsheet, Hispanic/LatinX, Military at Smartsheet, Parents & Caregivers, Rainbow Collab, and Women & Gender Minorities. ERGs are based on providing support and personal development in the work environment, however each group has its own goals and purpose designed in collaboration with the Vice President of DEI. Currently, 15% of employees are ERG members, and in the Employee Pulse Survey conducted in July 2022, 88% of ERG member respondents agree that ERGs contribute to an overall sense of belonging at Smartsheet. 
As part of our DEI strategy, we have developed a five-year plan to increase representation of underrepresented groups (specifically women and gender minorities, as well as people of color) at Smartsheet, both at the organization level and within leadership. While this is a long-term goal, we evaluate where we are tracking against this goal annually, developing short-term milestones focused primarily on hiring and retention for the fiscal year. To ensure our achievement of the five-year representation goals, leaders at or above the Vice President level are held accountable to annual goals, which comprise 5% of their annual bonus. Our quarterly workforce planning process highlights progress toward our current metrics, enabling leaders to achieve success on these goals. 
Corporate social responsibility 
At Smartsheet, we are committed to harnessing the power of our people, resources, and technology to support causes that reflect our vision of empowering human achievement. We encourage our employees to volunteer in their communities by offering paid volunteer time off. Each year, we make donations to nonprofit organizations which focus on causes that are meaningful to our business, customers, employees, and communities. We also support nonprofit organizations by offering discount pricing. These nonprofit organizations utilize Smartsheet to improve visibility and accountability, help run mission-oriented organizations, and achieve more. 
Environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) impact
Smartsheet is committed to driving sustainable business practices by promoting change for our stakeholders, customers, and communities. In the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024, Smartsheet will publish our first Corporate Social Responsibility report (“CSR Report”), drafted through a cross-functional working group within the Company. Our ESG initiatives are guided through Board oversight, with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee tasked through their charter with the review of Smartsheet’s programs, strategy, and public disclosures addressing ESG matters. Additionally, the Board's Compensation Committee provides oversight of certain human capital management items, including through assessment of diversity and inclusion as a component of the Company's workforce composition.
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing and sales teams work closely together to provide multiple ways for potential users to discover, try, adopt, and expand usage of Smartsheet over time. 
Table of Contents

Marketing
Our marketing organization is responsible for corporate brand reputation and management, increasing awareness and demand for our platform, and fostering our community of users. We target potential users across a wide variety of departments and functions in organizations of all sizes and industries. We employ a range of techniques to increase brand awareness, product interest, and traffic to our website, where we engage prospects throughout the buyer's journey and encourage new users to sign up for a 30-day free trial and purchase our subscription services online. These marketing techniques include advertising, brand marketing, content marketing, search marketing, social marketing, digital marketing, events, communications, and more. We frequently engage with respected industry analyst firms to educate them on the benefits of our platform and accelerate the maturation of an appropriate market category.
We have also built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. These partners offer access to our platform through links on their websites and expand our marketing reach.
In September 2022, we hosted our annual global customer conference, Smartsheet ENGAGE, to provide current and prospective users a better understanding of our platform through interactions with peers and training, and to highlight customer successes, use cases, and best practices.
Sales
Our sales organization is responsible for driving customer expansion and new customer opportunities. Our sales force is organized into separate teams focused on new customers, small to medium-sized businesses, large enterprises, geographic regions, and industries. Our assisted sales model relies on machine learning and lead scoring to identify users based on their likelihood to purchase our platform. Further, once we identify an opportunity for meaningful expansion within a customer organization, we can assign a customer success manager and an expansion sales representative to that customer. When an organization reaches a certain level of usage, we typically assign a field sales representative who is focused on growing adoption in these large accounts and expanding usage to a broader set of use cases.
Customer Success
Our customer success organization enables our customers through user onboarding, feature discovery, realizing value, building sponsorship, and managing renewals. These motions span a range of engagement methods from pure digital delivery to in person motions each maximizing our net dollar retention.
Professional Services
Our professional services team provides our customers with solution, training, and consulting services to help them realize the full benefits of Smartsheet. Our training programs include a mix of virtual and in-person offerings to onboard teams of users quickly and help individuals achieve certification-level subject matter expertise. Our consulting and solution services teams provide configuration, use case optimization, integration, and process automation services.
Customer Support
Our platform is designed to minimize the need for customer support, as users can easily sign up and begin using it without assistance. We provide significant self-help resources including our extensive help portal and our active online community. Additionally, we provide free support channels for users based on their plan type with additional paid support offerings available. These include ticket submission for all users at no cost, along with access to phone support and subject matter expert appointments as part of our paid plans. We also allocate support team member time to accounts for continuity of care through specialized paid offerings such as Technical Account Managers.

Customers
Our scalable collaborative work management platform helps teams and organizations of all sizes get work done quickly and efficiently. As of January 31, 2023, we had domain-based customers with ACVs ranging from less than $200 to over $4.0 million. We define a domain-based customer as an organization with at least one paid user account associated with a unique domain name such as @cisco. An ISP customer is typically a small team or an individual that registers for our services with an email address hosted on a widely used domain such as @gmail, @outlook, or @yahoo.
Our domain-based customers include organizations across virtually all sectors, including aerospace, automotive, biotechnology, consumer, e-commerce, education, finance, government, healthcare, IT services, marketing, media, non-profit, publishing, software, technology, and travel.
Backlog 
The majority of our invoiced customers sign up for subscription terms of one year and are invoiced for the full subscription term upfront. A small subset of customers sign multi-year subscription contracts but receive annual invoicing terms. Another smaller subset of customers with annual contract terms are invoiced on a quarterly or a semi-annual basis. When contract terms exceed invoicing terms, portions of those contracts which at a point in time remain uninvoiced, are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. Those contracted but uninvoiced amounts are considered by us to be backlog. As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, we had backlog of approximately $69.1 million and $53.9 million, respectively. As the majority of our contracts are annual, and as invoicing terms on the majority of our contracts are also upfront annual, most of our customer contracts have no impact on backlog and therefore we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally. 
Research and Development
Our research and development team consists of our engineering, user experience, design, and product management teams. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies and features for our platform. Our research and development team is also responsible for continuous availability, scalability, performance, and security of our platform and maintaining the underlying public cloud infrastructure. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market.
Intellectual Property
Smartsheet and its subsidiaries rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to protect their intellectual property. As of January 31, 2023, Smartsheet and its subsidiaries held a number of pending patent applications as well as issued and active patents. Additionally, as of January 31, 2023, Smartsheet and its subsidiaries held a number of U.S. and international trademark registrations, as well as pending trademark applications.
These intellectual property protections and applications seek to protect proprietary inventions and marks relevant to Smartsheet’s business. While we believe that in the aggregate these patents, patent applications, trademarks, and trademark applications are important to Smartsheet’s and its subsidiaries’ competitive positions, no single patent, trademark, or application is material. Smartsheet intends to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.

Our business is subject to various U.S. federal, state, local, as well as foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to privacy, data security, intellectual property, employment and labor, workplace safety, consumer protection, anti-bribery, import and export controls, immigration, federal securities, and tax. Additionally, we may currently or in the future be subject to various laws and regulations relating to the contractual commitments with our customers in heavily regulated industries and the public sector, which could affect how we and our partners do business with such customers. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
The legal environment of internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the U.S. and globally. New and evolving laws and regulations, and changes in their enforcement and interpretation, may require changes to our platform, products, services, or business practices, and may significantly increase our compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. As our business expands to include additional products and services, and our operations continue to expand internationally, our compliance requirements may increase, and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny. We believe we are currently in material compliance with laws and regulations to which we are subject and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations.
Competition
The market for collaborative work management software is fragmented, increasingly competitive, and subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. We face competition from a number of vendors with a variety of product offerings. Our competitors range in size, from diversified global companies with significant research and development and marketing resources, to smaller startups building on new technology platforms whose narrower offerings may allow them to be more efficient in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Our primary competition remains a combination of manual, email- and spreadsheet-based processes from providers that users have historically relied on to manage work such as Google and Microsoft, who offer a range of productivity solutions. While we currently collaborate with Google and Microsoft, they may develop and introduce, or acquire, products that directly or indirectly compete with our platform. Certain of our features compete with current or potential products and services offered by Airtable, Asana, Atlassian, ClickUp, Monday.com, Planview, Wrike, and others. Larger software vendors with substantial resources and smaller upstarts building on new technology platforms may also decide to enter our market by building or acquiring products that compete with our platform. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•ease of deployment and use of applications;
•product features, quality, and functionality;
•enterprise-grade security, scalability, compliance, and administration capabilities;
•ability to support mission critical workloads at scale;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•ability to automate multi-step processes;
•ability to integrate with other applications and systems;
•vision for the market and product innovation;
•pricing and total cost of ownership;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;

•brand awareness and reputation; and
•customer experience, including support.
We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on our enterprise-grade capabilities, focus on business user empowerment, and ability to support mission critical workflows at scale. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance and the quality of our platform.
