ITEM 1 BUSINESS 
Overview 
TransUnion is a leading global risk and information solutions provider to businesses and consumers. We provide consumer reports, risk scores, analytical services and decisioning capabilities to businesses. Businesses embed our solutions into their process workflows to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. Consumers use our solutions to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. We are differentiated by our comprehensive and unique datasets, our next-generation technology and our analytics and decisioning capabilities, which enable us to deliver insights across the entire consumer lifecycle. We believe we are the largest provider of risk and information solutions in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers. We have deep domain expertise across a number of attractive industries, which we also refer to as verticals, including financial services, healthcare, insurance and other markets we service. We have a global presence in over 30 countries and territories across North America, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, Asia Pacific and India. 
Our addressable market includes the big data and analytics market, which continues to grow as companies around the world recognize the benefits of building an analytical enterprise where decisions are made based on data and insights, and as consumers recognize the importance that data and analytics play in their ability to procure goods and services and protect their identities. International Data Corporation (“IDC”) estimates worldwide spending on big data and analytics services is projected to continue to grow at a CAGR of approximately 12% through 2022. There are several underlying trends supporting this market growth, including the creation of large amounts of data, advances in technology and analytics that enable data to be processed more quickly and efficiently to provide business insights, and growing demand for these business insights across industries and geographies. Leveraging our more than 50 year operating history and our established position as a leading provider of risk and information solutions, we have evolved our business by investing in a number of strategic initiatives, such as transitioning to the latest big data and analytics technologies, expanding the breadth and depth of our data, strengthening our analytics capabilities and enhancing our business processes. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to expand our share within the markets we currently serve and capitalize on the larger big data and analytics opportunity. 
We believe that we have the capabilities and assets, including comprehensive and unique datasets, advanced technology and analytics to provide differentiated solutions to our customers. We have over 65 petabytes of data, growing at an average rate of approximately 25% per year since 2010, representing over one billion consumers globally. Our solutions are based on a foundation of financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, healthcare, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information from approximately 90,000 data sources, including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. Our next-generation technology allows us to quickly and efficiently integrate our data with our analytics and decisioning capabilities to create and deliver innovative solutions to our customers and to quickly adapt to changing customer needs. Our deep analytics expertise, which includes our people as well as tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking and forecasting, enables businesses and consumers to gain better insights into their risk and financial data. Our decisioning capabilities, which are generally delivered on a software-as-a-service platform, allow businesses to interpret data and apply their specific qualifying criteria to make decisions and take actions. Collectively, our data, analytics and decisioning capabilities allow businesses to authenticate the identity of consumers, effectively determine the most relevant products for consumers, retain and cross-sell to existing consumers, identify and acquire new consumers and reduce loss from fraud. Similarly, our capabilities allow consumers to see how their credit profiles have changed over time, understand the impact of financial decisions on their credit scores, manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. 
We leverage our differentiated capabilities in order to serve a broad set of customers across multiple geographies and industry verticals. We have a global customer base of over 75,000 businesses and millions of consumers use our data to help manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. We offer our solutions to business customers in financial services, healthcare, insurance and other industries. Our customer base includes many of the largest companies in each of the primary industries we serve. For example, in the United States, we contract with the top ten largest consumer lending banks, the top ten credit card issuers, the top twenty largest auto insurance carriers, the top twenty-five auto lenders, and thousands of healthcare providers and federal, state and local government agencies.

We believe we have an attractive business model that has highly recurring and diversified revenue streams, low capital requirements, significant operating leverage and strong and stable cash flows. The proprietary and embedded nature of our solutions and the integral role that we play in our customers’ decision-making processes have historically translated into high customer retention and revenue visibility. For example, we have had ongoing relationships with our top ten financial institution customers for over ten years. We continue to demonstrate organic growth by further penetrating existing customers, innovating new solutions and gaining new customers. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses across our segments, reducing our exposure to cyclical trends in any particular industry vertical, or geography. We operate primarily on a contributory data model in which we typically obtain updated information at little or no cost and own most of our data. We augment this data with a growing set of public record and alternative data as we develop new solutions and expand into new industries and geographies. We also directly manage and control our technology, which provides us with an efficient cost structure and allows us to benefit from economies of scale. Additionally, our technology investments enable us to grow and expand our business with low incremental cost, providing significant operating leverage. 
Our total revenues increased from $1,933.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $2,317.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 19.8%. Our net income attributable to the Company decreased from $441.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included the onetime tax provision benefit of $174 million due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to $276.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our Adjusted EBITDA increased from $748.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $916.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 22.6%. As of December 31, 2018, the book value of our debt was $4.0 billion. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Key Performance Measures,” for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation to net income attributable to TransUnion.
Our Evolution 
Our business has over a 50 year operating history and a long track record of providing risk and information solutions to businesses and consumers while continuing to innovate to meet their changing needs. Since our founding as a provider of regional credit reporting services, we have built a comprehensive database of U.S. consumers, which created a unique and highly valuable base to build solutions that span many industry verticals and customer processes. From this base, we expanded our operations by targeting new customers, industry verticals and geographies and also entered the consumer space. We have strengthened our analytics and decisioning capabilities and acquired complementary datasets and technologies enabling us to enhance our solutions, diversify our revenue base and expand into other verticals, such as healthcare and insurance. We have grown our global presence to over 30 countries and territories, creating and acquiring credit reporting agencies in new geographies and establishing strong international footholds from which we could expand into other emerging markets. We also expanded the reach of our consumer solutions by partnering with other market leaders and innovators.
As part of our continued evolution, we have invested in a number of strategic initiatives that we believe will allow us to cater to the growing demand for data and analytics, provide differentiated solutions and better serve our customers. These initiatives include:

• | Investing in our Technology: Technology is at the core of the solutions we provide to our customers. We have made significant investments to modernize our infrastructure and to transition to the latest big data and analytics technologies which enable us to be quicker, more efficient and more cost-effective. Our next-generation technology enhances our ability to organize and handle high volumes of disparate data, improves delivery speeds, provides better availability and strengthens product development capabilities, while lowering our overall cost structure and allowing us to maintain our focus on information security. Our investment strategy has been to build capabilities and leverage them across multiple geographies and industry verticals. 


• | Expanding our Data: We have continued to invest in the breadth and depth of our data. We introduced the concept of trended data to provide the trajectory of a consumer’s risk profile, used public records data to enhance the scope of business issues we can address and incorporated alternative data into our databases to better assess risk for banked and unbanked consumers. We believe we are the largest provider of scale in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data. All of these initiatives improve the quality of our data, provide deeper insights into risk and allow us to create differentiated solutions for our customers. 


• | Strengthening our Analytics Capabilities: We have strengthened our analytics capabilities by leveraging our next-generation technology and expanded data, utilizing more advanced tools and growing our analytics team. This has allowed us to create solutions that produce greater insights and more predictive results, which help our customers make better decisions. In addition, our strengthened analytics capabilities have shortened our time-to-market to create and deliver these solutions to our customers. 


• | Broadening our Target Markets: We have grown our target markets by establishing a presence in attractive high-growth and strategic international markets such as the United Kingdom, India, Colombia and the Philippines, entering new verticals such as government and investigative services in the United States and expanding the reach of our consumer 

2

offerings by partnering with traditional and emerging providers in new verticals. Our capabilities enable us to develop scalable products that we are able to deploy across new markets and verticals.

• | Enhancing our Business Processes and Capabilities: We have enhanced our business processes and capabilities to support our growth. We have hired additional industry experts, which has allowed us to create and sell new vertical-specific solutions that address our customers’ needs. Our global sales force structure increases our sales team’s coverage of customers across our target markets. 

We believe that our ongoing focus on evolving with the market and with our customers’ needs ensures continued improvement in our overall services to businesses and consumers. Leveraging our trusted brand, global scale and strong market position in the verticals we serve will allow us to capitalize on business opportunities worldwide and contribute to our long-term growth.
Our Market Opportunity 
We believe there is a long-term trend of businesses and consumers using data and analytics to make more informed decisions and manage risk more effectively, resulting in a large and rapidly growing market. According to an August 2018 report from IDC, worldwide spending on big data and analytics services projected to continue to grow at a CAGR of approximately 12% through 2022.
We believe there are several key trends in the global macroeconomic environment affecting the geographies and industry verticals we serve that will create increasing demand for our solutions:

• | Rapid Growth in Data Creation and Application: Larger and more diversified datasets are now assembled faster while the breadth of analytical applications and solutions has expanded. Companies are increasingly relying on business analytics and big data technologies to help process this data in a cost-efficient manner. In addition, non-traditional sources of structured and unstructured data have become important in deriving alternative metrics. The proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices also generates enormous amounts of data tied to consumers, activities and locations. We believe that the demand for targeted data and sophisticated analytical solutions will continue to grow meaningfully as businesses seek real-time access to more granular views of consumer populations and more holistic views on individual consumers. 


• | Advances in Technology and Analytics Unlocking the Value of Data: Ongoing advances in data collection, storage and analytics technology have contributed to the greater use and value of data and analytics in decision making. As businesses have gained the ability to rapidly aggregate and analyze data, they increasingly expect access to real-time data and analytics from their information providers as well as solutions that fully integrate into their workflows. We believe this has made sophisticated technology critical for gaining and retaining business in the risk and information services industry. 


• | Greater Adoption of Big Data Solutions Across New and Existing Industry Verticals: With the proliferation of data, we believe companies across new and existing industry verticals recognize the value of risk information and analytical tools, particularly when tailored to their specific needs. 


• | Financial Services Industry: The combination of increased regulatory capital, additional compliance costs and the overhang of legacy assets is pushing large segments of small-to-medium-sized business and consumer lending out of the banking sector, resulting in the creation of new specialty finance companies, such as peer-to-peer lending platforms and online balance sheet lenders, which are actively filling the void. These technology-enabled lending platforms provide access to credit in a fast and efficient manner by utilizing sophisticated risk assessment tools that leverage data, such as behavioral data, transactional data and employment and credit information. At the same time, traditional financial services companies are also increasing the use of applications and data in order to address regulatory requirements, lower operating costs and better serve their customers. 


• | Healthcare Industry: Greater patient financial responsibility, focus on cost management and regulatory supervision are all driving healthcare providers to use data and related analytics tools to better manage their revenue cycle. For example, to reduce collection risks, healthcare providers seek information about their patients’ insurance coverage and ability to pay at the time of registration. In addition, insurance discovery tools are being utilized to optimize accounts receivable management, maximize collections and minimize uncompensated care. 


• | Insurance Industry: As consumers increasingly obtain quotes from multiple insurers in an effort to lower their costs, insurers are trying to improve the accuracy of their risk assessments and initial quotes. For example, insurance carriers are using driver violation data to uncover offenses that will impact pricing earlier in the quoting process so consumers have a more accurate view of the premiums they will be charged. 


• | Increasing Lending Activity in Emerging International Markets: As economies in emerging markets continue to develop and mature, we believe there will continue to be favorable socio-economic trends, such as an increase in the size of the middle class and a significant increase in the use of financial services by under-served and under-banked consumers. In addition, credit penetration is relatively low in emerging markets when compared to developed markets. For example, using our database of information compiled from financial institutions as a benchmark of credit activity, we estimate that 

3

less than 25% of the adult population in India is currently credit active. Furthermore, the widespread adoption and use of mobile phones in emerging markets have enabled greater levels of financial inclusion and access to banking and credit. We expect the populations in emerging markets to continue to become more credit active, resulting in increased demand for our services.

• | Increased Management and Monitoring of Personal Financial Information and Identity Protection by Consumers: Demand for consumer solutions is rising with greater consumer awareness of the importance and usage of their credit information, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and increasingly available free credit information. We estimate the number of consumer subscriptions to a credit monitoring or identity protection service has grown approximately 20% annually from 2015 through 2018. In addition, the proliferation of mobile devices has made data much more accessible, enabling consumers to manage their finances and monitor their information in real-time. We believe these trends will continue to drive growth for our consumer business. 

Our Competitive Strengths 
Comprehensive and Unique Datasets
Our long operating history and leadership in the industry have allowed us to build comprehensive and unique data assets that would be difficult for a new market entrant to replicate. We have over 65 petabytes of data, growing at an average rate of approximately 25% per year since 2010, representing over one billion consumers globally. Our solutions are based on a foundation of financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, healthcare, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information from approximately 90,000 data sources, including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. We keep our data current by processing billions of updates each month, and we continue to identify opportunities to acquire additional data. We believe that our data is unique and differentiates us from our competitors. We own several proprietary datasets such as consumer credit information, driver violation history, healthcare eligibility information, business data and rental payment history. Internationally, our data assets also encompass alternative data, such as the voter registry in India with nearly 790 million records and the vehicle information database in South Africa with over 20 million vehicle records. We have also acquired public record datasets, which are time consuming and difficult for others to obtain and associate with the correct person. We believe we are the largest provider of scale in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers.
Next-generation Technology
Our next-generation technology allows us to continually improve our overall services to businesses and consumers and ensures that we are well positioned to differentiate our datasets and capabilities. We believe our next-generation technology capabilities has resulted in increased throughput, improved data matching, greater efficiency, advanced platform flexibility and lower operating costs.

• | Powerful Big Data Capabilities: Our technology gives us the ability to process, organize and analyze high volumes of data across multiple operating systems, databases and file types as well as to deal with both structured and unstructured data that changes frequently. We process billions of transactions on a daily basis. 


• | Enhanced Linking and Matching: Because our data matching technology is able to interrelate data across disparate sources, industries and time periods, we believe that we are able to create differentiated datasets and provide our customers with comprehensive insights that allow them to better evaluate risk. For example, our TLOxp solution leverages these data matching capabilities across various datasets to identify and investigate relationships among people, assets, locations and businesses, allowing us to offer enhanced due diligence, threat assessment, identity authentication and fraud prevention and detection solutions. 


• | Greater Efficiency: From ingestion of data to distribution of analytics and insights, our next-generation technology enables a faster time to market. For example, a portion of our platform now allows for data profiling, cleansing and ingestion of data significantly faster and can be done in a self-service approach by non-IT power users, allowing us to significantly reduce overall production times for new products. 


• | Advanced Platform Flexibility: Our technology offers a high degree of flexibility, speed and customization of our solutions, via capabilities like graphical development and business rules environments, and allows easy integration with our customers’ workflows. We manage and control our technology instead of outsourcing it, which provides us with the flexibility to prioritize changes and to quickly implement any updates to our applications and solutions. 


• | Lower Operating Costs: Our technology investments have lowered our overall cost to maintain and develop our systems, allowing us to redeploy significantly more resources to support revenue generating initiatives, such as vertical expansion and new product development.

• | DriverRisk: Leveraging our driver violation database, we developed DriverRisk, a data and analytic solution that helps auto insurance carriers cost effectively validate driving records and assess risk during the underwriting and renewal process to improve returns. 


• | Insurance Coverage Discovery and Other Health Insurance: For our healthcare customers, we offer insurance coverage discovery, coordination of benefits, and third party liability solutions, which enables the discovery of previously unidentified health insurance coverage to help both our provider and payer customers receive appropriate payment for uncompensated care and coordination of benefits payments. Our proprietary technology identifies patient accounts that qualify Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSH), Medicare, TRICARE and commercial insurance benefits and monitors an account for up to three years for retroactive eligibility that providers may have missed. 


• | IDVision with iovation: We have recently expanded the capabilities of IDVision with the acquisition of iovation, Inc. (“iovation”) in June 2018. iovation is one of the most advanced providers of device-based information in the world, with insight into nearly 5 billion unique devices. In October 2018 we announced the expansion of our IDVision product, which we now call IDVision with iovation. IDVision with iovation offers an enhanced suite of identity management, authentication and fraud prevention solutions that protect businesses from fraud while enabling great experiences for their online users. This results in a global network effect of fraud and risk insights that allow businesses to quickly and accurately determine good customers from fraudulent ones.

 Deep and Specialized Industry Expertise
We have deep expertise in a number of attractive industry verticals including financial services, healthcare and insurance. Our expertise has allowed us to develop sophisticated vertical-specific solutions within these targeted industries that play an integral role in our customers’ decision-making processes and are often embedded into their workflows. Our team includes industry experts with significant experience in the verticals that we target and relationships with leading companies in those verticals. We also possess regulatory compliance expertise across the industries that we serve. Together, this provides us with a comprehensive understanding of business trends and insights for customers in these verticals, allowing us to build solutions that cater to these customers’ specific requirements. We have been able to apply our industry knowledge, data assets, technology and analytics capabilities to develop new solutions and revenue opportunities within key verticals. For example, in financial services, our differentiated position allowed us to anticipate the increased demand for alternative consumer lending providers such as peer-to-peer lending platforms, and we created solutions that catered to these emerging providers. In insurance, we partnered with a vehicle history data provider to launch a vehicle history score that helps insurance carriers further segment risk based on the attributes of a specific automobile. In healthcare, we developed a solution that allows healthcare providers to search for additional health insurance coverage and recover additional uncompensated care costs.
Leading Presence in Attractive International Markets
We have been operating internationally for over 30 years and have strong global brand recognition. We have strategically targeted attractive markets in both developed and emerging economies and have a diversified global presence in over 30 countries and territories and a leading presence in several attractive international markets North America, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, Asia Pacific and India. We have local, senior management in many of our international markets, and we believe this provides us with deeper insights into these markets and stronger relationships with our customers. We have leveraged our brand, operating history, global footprint and technology infrastructure to establish new credit bureaus in several international markets, such as Canada in 1989, India in 2001 and the Philippines in 2011. Once established, our model is to expand the services we offer within these markets and then move into adjacent emerging markets. For example, we have used our operations in Hong Kong to expand into other Asia Pacific countries and provide analytic scoring models in the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. We have used our operations in South Africa to expand into neighboring African countries. We have also entered new markets through strategic acquisitions, including the United Kingdom in 2018, Colombia in 2016, and Brazil in 2011. In addition, we have been able to leverage our technology and experience from our U.S. operations to develop and grow our international operations. For example, we have expanded our CreditVision product into Canada, Asia Pacific, India, Africa and Latin America and expect to launch CreditVision in the United Kingdom in 2019. We have also expanded our direct-to-consumer business into all of our regions, and have implemented DecisionEdge across more than 600 active solutions in over 10 countries.

Our Growth Strategy 
Enhance Underlying Data, Technology and Analytics Capabilities to Develop Innovative Solutions
As the demand for big data and analytics solutions grows across industries and geographies, we will continue to expand the scope of our underlying data, improve our tools and technology and enhance our analytics and decisioning capabilities to provide innovative solutions that address this demand. As the needs of businesses and consumers evolve, we plan to continue to help them meet their challenges, which our recent investments in data, technology and analytics enable us to do more quickly and efficiently. For example, we enhanced our solutions with incremental data such as rental trade lines, additional contact data and auto asset data in order to address a broader set of customer requirements. Our recent technology investments have also reduced the time to market for new solutions, in certain instances from several weeks to a few days, which allow us to react quickly to customer requirements. We also intend to continue to take advantage of strategic partnerships to develop innovative services that differentiate us from our competitors.
Further Penetrate Existing Industry Verticals with Current and New Solutions
We are a leading provider of risk and information solutions in several industry verticals today, including financial services, healthcare and insurance. We believe there is significant opportunity for further growth within these industries by expanding the number of customers to whom we sell our current solutions as well as by creating innovative new solutions that we can use to grow our presence in these industries. We focus on developing new solutions that address evolving customer needs within our industry verticals. For example, in the financial services vertical, we launched Prama, an analytic workbench that enables access to massive anonymized data sets for benchmarking and attribute development. We also developed CreditVision, which provides customers with a time-based risk trend and increases the total eligible population of consumers. Similarly, in the insurance vertical, we introduced the DriverRisk solution that leverages our driver violation database to cost effectively identify drivers with ratable violations, resulting in unique insights into driver risk and reduced costs and higher returns for insurance carriers. In order to more effectively address these opportunities, we have redeployed and reallocated our sales resources to focus either on new customer opportunities or on selling additional services and solutions to existing customers. With our leading market positions, existing strong relationships in financial services, healthcare and insurance verticals and with our consumer partners, we believe we have the opportunity to further penetrate our existing customer base and capture a greater proportion of their spending across the consumer lifecycle.
Establish Positions in New, Adjacent Industry Verticals
In addition to increasing penetration in industries where we have a substantial presence, we also intend to create solutions that address customer needs in attractive new industries. Our strategy is to develop new solutions for a specific application, industry vertical or geography and then deploy them to other markets where they may be applicable. We believe that our capabilities allow us to quickly create and deliver solutions to new industries and geographies where information-based analytics and decisioning capabilities are currently underutilized. For example, our strong position in financial services and insurance verticals has allowed us to establish a presence in the healthcare vertical to capitalize on the increasing demand for data and analytics solutions. We have created innovative solutions that automate the insurance and payment processes at the beginning of the revenue cycle, help payers analyze claims-related data, facilitate performance reporting, help patients make informed decisions and optimize the collection of revenue. We continue to target other verticals such as public sector, rental screening, collections and investigative services, where we see an opportunity to leverage our existing data, analytics and decisioning capabilities.
Expand our Presence in Attractive International Markets
We believe international markets present a significant opportunity for growth, as these economies continue to develop and their populations become more credit active. We have significant scale in some of the world’s fastest growing markets, which positions us well to take advantage of the favorable dynamics in these regions. We leverage solutions developed in the United States and deploy them to international markets, after localizing them to individual market requirements. For example, after launching CreditVision in the United States, we have expanded our offerings with similar solutions in Canada, Asia Pacific, India, Africa and Latin America and expect to launch CreditVision in the United Kingdom in 2019. In markets where we have established a presence in a particular vertical, we will expand further into adjacent verticals, such as insurance and consumer solutions. We intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by forming alliances with financial services institutions, industry associations and other local partners, and by pursuing strategic acquisitions. Across all our international expansion initiatives, we will continue to leverage our next-generation technology to drive speed to market, scale and differentiation.
Continue to Broaden Reach in Consumer Market through Direct and Indirect Channels
Our consumer business has delivered market-leading growth, driven by our innovative solutions and flexible and collaborative partnership model that has expanded the market for consumer services, along with greater consumer awareness of the value of their credit information and increased risk of identity theft. Our strategy is to grow our own member base in the direct channel as 
7

well as expand our reach through partnerships in the indirect channel. Across both channels, our focus is on delivering value-added solutions and features while continuing to improve the consumer experience with more user-friendly interfaces and better customer service and educational tools. Within our indirect channel, we will continue to leverage and enhance our flexible technology platform to expand our relationship with existing partners as well as develop relationships with new partners and enter new verticals. We believe that partnerships not only enable us to grow our own business, but they also expand the overall market and provide us access to new consumer segments. We will also continue to leverage our approach in the U.S. consumer market to expand our consumer operations globally.
Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
We will continue to pursue acquisitions to accelerate growth within our existing businesses and diversify into new businesses. We are focused primarily on opportunities that are strategic to us, including opportunities that expand our geographic footprint, increase the breadth and depth of our datasets, enhance our services, provide us with industry expertise in our key verticals and deepen our presence in our international markets.
In June 2018 we acquired iovation, one of the most advanced providers of device-based information in the world, strengthening our leadership position in fraud and identity management. iovation pioneered the device intelligence industry and provides a highly advanced digital device reputation consortium, with insight into nearly 5 billion unique devices from more than 35,000 leading brands across more than 50 countries. In October 2018 we announced the launch of IDVision with iovation. IDVision with iovation brings together a combination of TransUnion’s extensive personal data with iovation’s digital data. IDVision with iovation offers an enhanced suite of identity management, authentication and fraud prevention solutions that protect businesses from fraud while enabling great experiences for their online users. This results in a global network effect of fraud and risk insights that allow businesses to quickly and accurately determine good customers from fraudulent ones. In addition to other capabilities, iovation’s marquee FraudForce Device-based Reputation product has been integrated into our enhanced suite of solutions.
Further, our acquisition of FactorTrust, Inc. in 2017 reinforces our position as a provider of consumer reporting models that capture a wide range of positive payment behaviors. And our 2017 acquisition of eBureau, LLC, a leading provider of custom analytic solutions with both credit-risk and anti-fraud applications, demonstrates our commitment to build upon our success as a source of groundbreaking, versatile data and analytics capabilities.
We also have expanded into new countries such as the United Kingdom, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia. In June 2018, we acquired Callcredit Information Group, Ltd. (“Callcredit”), the second largest and fastest growing consumer credit bureau in the U.K. Founded in 2000, Callcredit is a U.K.-based information solutions company that, like TransUnion, provides data, analytics and technology solutions to help businesses and consumers make informed decisions. With a strong record of growth and innovation in both core credit and emerging solutions, Callcredit has achieved strong market success in the U.K.
We have also enhanced our domestic healthcare offerings through various acquisitions over the past few years. In June 2018, we acquired Healthcare Payment Specialists, Inc. (“HPS”), a leader in helping healthcare providers optimize Medicare reimbursement. The acquisition of HPS adds innovative technology that helps healthcare providers identify and recover Medicare reimbursements that they otherwise would not have received. Medicare accounts for 20% of total healthcare expenditures in the U.S., and the market for Medicare reimbursement optimization solutions is growing rapidly. HPS helps healthcare providers maximize Medicare reimbursement by focusing on payment areas where superior technology and deep domain expertise can drive significant improvements. The addition of HPS’s solutions further positions TransUnion as a market leader in post-discharge revenue recovery. TransUnion Healthcare’s Revenue Protection solutions help hospitals prevent revenue leakage by engaging patients early, ensuring that their earned revenue gets paid, and optimizing their collection strategies. The company partners with hospitals and health systems to protect billions in net revenue and cash to date for its entire client base.
In October 2018, we acquired Rubixis, Inc. (“Rubixis”), an innovative healthcare revenue cycle solutions company that helps providers maximize reimbursement from insurance payers. Rubixis brings specialized expertise in the management of denials and underpayments, two significant pain points for healthcare providers. Rubixis’ revenue cycle optimization capabilities, particularly around denials and underpayments, round out TransUnion Healthcare’s solutions and positions us as the leader in post-discharge revenue recovery for healthcare providers seeking to maximize reimbursement and prevent revenue leakage.
Our 2016 acquisitions of RTech Healthcare Revenue Technologies, Inc. (“RTech”) and Auditz, LLC, (“Auditz”), two entities with proprietary technology that helps healthcare providers protect revenue and identify and recover payments, further bolstered our healthcare revenue cycle solutions.
Other examples include our December 2015 acquisition of Trustev, Ltd., a provider of digital verification technology to multiple industries, our November 2014 acquisition of DHI, a provider of traffic violations and criminal court data, our October 2014 acquisition of L2C, an innovator in predictive analytics using alternative data that is able to provide risk perspectives on non-traditional and non-credit active consumers and our December 2013 acquisition of TLO’s assets, providing data solutions leveraging proprietary public records data for identity authentication, fraud prevention and debt recovery.

From time to time, we may also seek to increase our investments in foreign entities in which we have less than a 100% equity interest, as we did with Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (“CIBIL”) in India in 2014 through 2017, increasing our ownership to over 92%. We have a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and driving long-term value creation, and we will continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pursuing acquisitions.
Segment Overview 
Over the past few years, we have completed a significant number of acquisitions that have transformed our business. We have also developed a significant number of new product offerings that have further diversified our portfolio of businesses. As a result of the evolution of our business, we have changed the disaggregated revenue and our measure of segment profit (Adjusted EBITDA) information that we provide to our chief operating decision makers (our “CODM”) to better align with how we manage the business. Accordingly, our disclosures around the disaggregation of our revenue and the measure of segment profit have been recast for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to conform to the information used by our CODM. We have not changed our reportable segments and these changes do not impact our consolidated results. 
We manage our business and report our financial results in three reportable segments: U.S. Information Services (or “USIS”), International and Consumer Interactive. We also report expenses for Corporate, which provides shared services and conducts enterprise functions. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” Note 16, “Reportable Segments,” for further information about our reportable segments.
USIS
Our USIS segment provides consumer reports, risk scores, analytical services and decisioning capabilities to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud.
We deliver our solutions across multiple industry vertical markets within USIS and report disaggregated revenue as follows:
Financial Services: The financial services vertical, which accounts for 53% of our 2018 USIS revenue, consists of our consumer lending, mortgage, auto and cards and payments lines of business. Our financial services clients consist of most banks, credit unions, finance companies, auto lenders, mortgage lenders, online-only lenders (FinTech), and other consumer lenders in the United States. We also distribute our solutions through most major resellers, secondary market players and sales agents. Beyond traditional lenders, we work with a variety of credit arrangers, such as auto dealers and peer-to-peer lenders. We provide solutions across every aspect of the lending lifecycle; customer acquisition and engagement, fraud and ID management, retention and recovery. Our products are focused on mitigating risk and include credit reporting, credit marketing, analytics and consulting, identity verification and authentication and debt recovery solutions.
Emerging Verticals: Emerging verticals include healthcare, insurance, collections, property management, public sector and other diversified markets. Our solutions in these verticals are also data-driven and address the entire customer lifecycle. We offer onboarding and transaction processing products, scoring and analytic products, marketing solutions, fraud and identity management solutions and customer retention solutions.
Within USIS, we leverage our comprehensive data assets, data matching expertise and predictive analytics to develop risk-based solutions:

• | Comprehensive Data Assets: Our credit database contains the name and address of substantially all of the U.S. credit-active population, a listing of their existing credit relationships and their timeliness in repaying debt obligations. The information in our database is voluntarily provided by thousands of credit-granting institutions and other data furnishers. We enhance our data assets with alternative credit sources such as rental payments and utility payments. We also actively source information from courts, government agencies and other public records including suits, liens, judgments, bankruptcies, professional licenses, real property, vehicle ownership, other assets, driver violations, criminal records and contact information. Our databases are updated, reviewed and monitored on a regular basis. 


• | Predictive Analytics: Our predictive analytics capabilities allow us to analyze our proprietary datasets and provide insights to our customers to allow them to drive better business decisions. Our tools allow customers to investigate past behavior, reasonably predict the likelihood of future events and strategize actions based on those predictions. We have numerous tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking, forecasting, fraud modeling and campaign optimization, all of which cater to specific customer requirements. Our predictive analytics capabilities are developed by an analytics team with deep industry experience and a broad array of specialized qualifications.

International
The International segment provides services similar to our USIS segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and decisioning services and other value-added risk management services. In addition, we have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, retail credit, insurance, automotive, collections, public sector and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer solutions similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment to help consumers proactively manage their personal finances. We report disaggregated revenue of our International segment for the following regions: 
United Kingdom: In June 2018, we entered the world’s second largest credit market, the United Kingdom, when we acquired Callcredit. Callcredit is the second largest and fastest growing consumer credit bureau in the U.K. Founded in 2000, Callcredit is an information solutions company that, like TransUnion, provides data, analytics and technology solutions to help businesses and consumers make informed decisions across a diverse group of industries. Callcredit has achieved strong market success in the U.K. and serves a broad customer base of approximately 2,500 customers, including the top 10 banks and customers in attractive, high-growth segments such as alternative finance, digital commerce and the public sector. We expect to recognize substantial cost and revenue synergies as we continue to integrate Callcredit into our operations.
Canada: We have operated in Canada since 1989 and are one of only two nationwide consumer reporting agencies in the Canadian market. We operate across multiple verticals in Canada with leading positions in insurance and automotive with a strong and growing presence in financial services. Our Canadian customer base encompasses some of the largest companies in their verticals, including the top five largest banks, eight of the largest credit card issuers, eight of the top ten insurance companies and the top nine auto manufacturer lenders. We have recently grown our operations in Canada by acquiring new customers and we expect to continue to grow by introducing innovative new solutions, such as CreditVision and DecisionEdge, by increasing our presence with existing customers and by growing our market share with businesses and consumers.
Latin America: We have been active in Latin America since 1985 when we entered the Puerto Rican market, and we have operations in numerous Central and South American countries, including a strong presence in Colombia, where in February 2016 we acquired CIFIN, one of two primary credit bureaus in Colombia. Together with CIFIN, we collect data from more than 3,000 traditional and alternate data sources, process over 370 million transactions annually and can provide credit reports and scores on nearly all individuals and 2.8 million businesses. In Colombia, we have over three thousand customers across multiple industries, including the top five private banks and top two telecommunications companies and six of the top ten insurance companies. In Brazil, we are a leading provider in decisioning services with over 40 million transactions processed monthly across key industry verticals. We believe we have the most extensive alternative database in Brazil with information on over 200 million consumers and 39 million companies. Our customer base in Brazil includes seven of the top ten banks, fourteen of the top fifteen automotive insurance carriers, four of the top five telecommunications groups and the largest Latin America online sales site. We also have a significant credit bureau business in the Dominican Republic and a 25.69% ownership interest in Trans Union de México, S.A., the primary credit reporting agency in Mexico. In Guatemala, we maintain a centralized database that services Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. We also acquired a Chilean credit reporting agency in 2010.
Africa: We launched our operations in Africa by entering South Africa in 1993. We are highly diversified and serve a variety of industries through traditional consumer credit reporting services, insurance solutions, auto information solutions, commercial credit information services and consumer solutions in South Africa. We provide risk and information solutions in Africa to the top four banks, six of the top seven retailers, five of the top six dealer groups, and the top six insurers. We manage the database of all personal claims, policy and vehicle information on behalf of the South African Insurance Association and offer innovative solutions throughout the policy lifecycle. Our extensive vehicle information database in South Africa, which has over 20 million vehicle records and includes unique vehicle identifier codes, differentiates us from other providers. Our leading presence in South Africa has allowed us to expand into surrounding countries including Kenya, Namibia, Swaziland, Botswana, Zambia, Rwanda, and Malawi. With the completion of our technology transformation in South Africa, we are able to leverage our big data platform to ingest, process and analyze data at increasingly higher speeds and volumes with greater accuracy and reliability.
India: In 2001, we partnered with prominent Indian financial institutions to create CIBIL, the first consumer and business credit reporting agency in India. In 2014, we acquired a majority interest in CIBIL and further increased our ownership interest to over 92% in 2017. We now include their results in our consolidated financial statements. We are CIBIL’s sole technology, analytics and decision services provider for its consumer risk information services business. In the absence of a comprehensive national ID, we created an innovative matching algorithm that allowed us to create the most extensive consumer credit database in India. Our credit database includes information on over 360 million consumers and over 20 million business entities.
In addition, we own or have access to several non-credit data sources that we use to enhance our solutions. These include the national voters’ registry with nearly 790 million records, as well as other sources such as the confirmed and suspected fraud registry, 
10

property registry and tax ID database. We offer a suite of risk and information solutions across the credit lifecycle for banks, telecommunication companies and insurance companies. Our suite of offerings includes analytics and decisioning solutions that enable our customers to make faster decisions. We are the primary risk and information solutions provider for financial institutions in India and our customers include all of the top twenty banks. We developed and launched the first generic credit score for India in 2007, which is the most widely used and adopted credit score across the financial services industry in India. In addition to our business solutions, we also offer consumer solutions such as online credit reports and scores.
Asia Pacific: Our operations in Asia Pacific include markets such as Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, China and the Philippines. We have had a majority ownership interest in the principal consumer credit reporting company in Hong Kong since 1998. We are a primary supplier of consumer credit data and value-added solutions to the top ten banks in Hong Kong. Additionally, we use our established operations in Hong Kong as a base to expand into other emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region. We expect to continue to grow and transform the Hong Kong business by offering analytics, identity management, decisioning and consumer solutions. Asia Pacific is a growing market with increasing demand for credit driven by a rising middle class that offers significant growth potential in analytics and decisioning. Using Hong Kong as a base, we have leveraged our global intellectual property to expand to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, we launched the first consumer credit reporting agency in the Philippines in 2011 in partnership with the top-five credit card issuers in that market. We leverage our global intellectual property to scale very quickly and our solutions are now used for lending decisions by over 40% of the major banks in the Philippines. We have built credit risk scores for the National Credit Bureau of Thailand, in which we have a 12.25% ownership interest, Credit Bureau of Singapore and Credit Bureau of Malaysia. We also have a presence in China, where we currently provide fraud and authentication solutions to financial institutions.
Consumer Interactive
Consumer Interactive offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, fraud protection and resolution and financial management. Our products are provided through user-friendly online and mobile interfaces and are supported by educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels.
Direct: We provide services directly to consumers, primarily on a subscription basis through websites and mobile applications. Product features include credit reports, credit scores and analysis, alerts to changes in credit information, debt analysis, debt and retirement calculators, identity protection services, and the ability to restrict third-party access to a consumer’s TransUnion and Equifax credit reports through our paid subscription offering. We complement these features with educational content that explains how credit and financial data is used in various industries to evaluate consumers and how a consumer’s financial choices impact this evaluation. Our integrated, data-driven marketing strategy spans multiple channels including paid search, online display and email, which allows us to efficiently acquire and retain high quality consumers.
Indirect: We also provide our services to partners who may offer them on a stand-alone basis or with their own or other branded services as a bundle to consumers, governmental agencies and businesses in support of fraud or credit protection, credit monitoring, identity authentication, or as a means to engage with and acquire consumers. We offer a broad suite of solutions that include many of the features, educational content and customer support available in our direct channel. We have taken a proactive and flexible partnership approach, which has resulted in long-term strategic relationships with some of the largest providers of credit information or identity protection services in the U.S. consumer market as well as with several large financial institutions. Through these partnerships, we have significantly expanded the overall market as well as the reach of our business.
Corporate
Corporate provides support services to each segment, holds investments and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the segments remain in Corporate. These costs are primarily enterprise-level costs and are administrative in nature.
Markets and Customers 
We have a highly diversified customer base, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 4% of revenue in 2018 and 5% of revenue in 2017. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 17% of revenue in 2018 and 19% in 2017. Our customers include companies across multiple industries, including financial services, healthcare and insurance. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from companies in the financial services industry and from sales in the United States.
We leverage our comprehensive data assets, industry expertise and our next-generation common code-based technology, allowing us to build solutions once and deploy them multiple times across the different verticals and regions. We provide services to our customers through real-time, online delivery for services such as credit reports and predictive scores, in batch form for services that help our customers proactively acquire new customers, cross-sell to existing customers and help them monitor and manage risk, and through our software-as-a-service offerings, which include a number of solutions that help businesses interpret data, 
11

maximize reimbursements, visualize insights, predict model results and apply their customer-specific criteria to facilitate real-time automated decisions at the time of customer interaction, and through our websites to consumers, for various subscription-based and transaction-based products in the United States and in other regions we serve. 
We have a presence in over 30 countries and territories across North America, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Africa, Asia Pacific and India. We market our services primarily through our own sales force. We have dedicated sales teams for our largest customers focused by industry group and geography. These dedicated sales teams provide strategic account management and direct support to customers. We use shared sales teams to sell our services to mid-size customers. These sales teams are based in our headquarters office and in field offices strategically located throughout the United States and abroad. Smaller customers’ sales needs are serviced primarily through call centers. We also market our services through indirect channels such as resellers, who sell directly to businesses and consumers. Our interactive direct-to-consumer services are sold primarily through our website.
Seasonality 
Seasonality in the USIS segment is correlated to volumes of online credit data purchased by our financial services and mortgage customers, and our sales have generally been higher during the second and third quarters. Seasonality in our International segment is driven by local economic conditions and relevant macroeconomic market trends. In our Consumer Interactive segment, demand for our products is usually higher in the first half of the year, impacted by seasonality and our advertising spend. 
Competition
The market for our services is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of differentiated solutions, datasets, analytics capabilities, ease of integration with our customers’ technology, stability of services, customer relationships, innovation and price. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. Our competitors vary based on the business segment, industry vertical and geographical market that our solutions address.
In our USIS segment, our competition generally includes Equifax, Experian and LexisNexis, in addition to certain competitors whom we only compete with in specific industry verticals. For example, we compete with FICO in the financial services vertical, with Solera and Verisk in the insurance vertical, with Experian Health, IMS Health, Inovalon and Trizetto in the healthcare vertical and with LifeLock and Experian in the fraud solutions market.
In our International segment, we generally compete with Equifax and Experian directly or indirectly through their subsidiaries or investments. We also compete with other competitors that may focus on a particular vertical, country or region.
In our Consumer Interactive segment, we generally compete with Equifax, Experian, FICO and LifeLock as well as emerging businesses, some of whom offer free credit information.
In addition to these competitors, we also compete with a number of other companies that may offer niche solutions catering to more specific customer requirements.
We believe the services we provide to our customers reflect our understanding of our customers’ businesses, the depth and breadth of our data and the quality of our analytics and decisioning capabilities. By integrating our services into our customers’ workflows, we ensure efficiency, continuous improvement and long-lasting relationships.
Information Technology
Technology
The continuous operation of our information technology systems is fundamental to our business. Our information technology systems collect, refine, access, process, deliver and store the data that is used to provide our solutions. Customers connect to our systems using a number of different technologies, including secured internet connections, virtual private networks and dedicated network connections. Control and management of the technology that operates our business is critical to our success and to this end, we directly control and manage all of our technology and infrastructure. Our technology relies on several third-party best-of-breed solutions as well as proprietary software and tools which we integrate into our platforms. Our control of our technology and infrastructure allows us to prioritize any changes and manage the roll-out of any upgrades or changes. We contract with various third-party providers to help us maintain and support our systems.
We have established technology Centers-of-Excellence that utilize similar tools and technology in order to provide scale and efficiency in modifying existing applications and developing new applications for our businesses. We deploy new development methodologies globally to enable rapid delivery of solutions and increase our speed-to-market. Our technology team includes both our own employees as well as additional resources from third-party providers.
 We believe that our technology is at the core of our innovative solutions, and we continually invest in our technology and thought leaders to be a market leader. We continue to make significant investments in our technology infrastructure to leverage the latest 
12

big data and analytics technologies. We believe that our next-generation platform enables us to be quicker, more efficient and more cost-effective across each step of our process chain, including receiving, consolidating and updating data, implementing analytics and decisioning capabilities, creating innovative solutions, delivering those solutions to our customers and incorporating customer feedback. Our platform has significant scale and capacity and enables us to deliver actionable information immediately to our customers. Our technology infrastructure gives us the ability to organize and handle high volumes of disparate data, maintain and improve our delivery speeds, increase availability and enhance our product development capabilities, while at the same time lowering our overall cost structure.
Data Centers and Business Continuity
In order to create redundancy and increase resiliency, we utilize multiple data centers in all of our major markets. We generally employ similar technologies and infrastructures in each data center to enable the optimal sharing of technical resources across geographies.
We maintain a framework for business continuity that includes written policies requiring each business and operating unit to identify critical functions. Our businesses and operating units have processes in place that are designed to maintain such functions in case there is a disruptive event. We also have a specific disaster recovery plan that will take effect if critical infrastructure or systems fail or become disabled.
As part of our program, each business unit’s continuity plan is periodically updated and stored in a centralized database. These plans are monitored and reviewed by our compliance team. From time to time, our compliance team tests one or more of these plans using desktop exercises or in connection with actual events. We also periodically confirm the state of preparedness of our most critical disaster recovery procedures. We maintain systems redundancy plans for our primary U.S. data centers that allow for the transfer of capacity between geographically disbursed environments in the event there is a failure of computer hardware or a loss of our primary telecommunications lines or power sources. On an enterprise basis, our systems are designed to recover most of our operational capacity in a scenario where our primary data centers become inoperable.
Security
The security and protection of non-public consumer information is one of our highest priorities. We have a written information security program based on the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard with dedicated personnel charged with overseeing that program. Our information security program incorporates continuous improvement methodology and evaluates threats, industry events and asset values to help us appropriately adjust security controls. We employ a wide range of physical and technical safeguards that are designed to provide security around the collection, storage, use, access and delivery of information we have in our possession. These safeguards include firewalls, intrusion protection and monitoring, anti-virus and malware protection, vulnerability threat analysis, management and testing, advanced persistent threat monitoring, forensic tools, encryption technologies, data transmission standards, contractual provisions, customer credentialing, identity and access management, data loss, access and anomaly reports and training programs for associates. We, with other global financial services organizations, including U.S. nationwide consumer credit reporting companies, share cyber threat and attack information through our participation in the Financial Information Sharing and Analysis Council (“FS-ISAC”) and other forums that may be targeted at our industry to better understand and monitor our systems and our connectivity to our customers, as well as how specific solutions that were implemented to protect against such attacks are performing. We undergo SSAE 16 reviews annually, and several of our major customers routinely audit our security controls. We conduct an annual Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliance program and remain PCI certified. Additionally, we also hire third parties to conduct independent information security assessments.
Intellectual Property and Licensing Agreement
Our intellectual property is a strategic advantage and protecting it is critical to our business. Because of the importance of our intellectual property, we treat our brand, software, technology, know-how, concepts and databases as proprietary. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights under the trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, as well as through the use of licenses and contractual agreements, such as nondisclosure agreements. While we hold various patents, we do not rely primarily on patents to protect our core intellectual property. Through contractual arrangements, disclosure controls and continual associate training programs, our principal focus is to treat our key proprietary information and databases as trade secrets. Also, we have registered certain trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos, internet URLs and other marks of distinction in the United States and foreign countries, the most important of which is the trademark TransUnion name and logo. This trademark is used in connection with most of the services we sell and we believe it is a known mark in the industry.
We own proprietary software that we use to maintain our databases and to develop and deliver our services. We develop and maintain business-critical software that transforms data furnished by various sources into databases upon which our services are built. We also develop and maintain software to manage our consumer interactions, including providing disclosures and resolving disputes. In all business segments, we develop and maintain software applications that we use to deliver services to our customers, 
13

through a software-as-a-service model. In particular, we develop and maintain decisioning technology infrastructure that we host and integrate into our customers’ workflow systems to improve the efficiency of their operations.
We license certain data and other intellectual property to other companies on arms-length terms that are designed to protect our rights to our intellectual property. We generally use standard licensing agreements and do not provide our intellectual property to third parties without a nondisclosure and license agreement in place.
We also license certain intellectual property that is important for our business from third parties. For example, we license credit-scoring algorithms and the right to sell credit scores derived from those algorithms from third parties for a fee.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 7,100 employees throughout the world. Other than certain employees in Brazil, none of our employees is currently represented by a labor union or have terms of employment that are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages.
Our History
TransUnion Corp. was spun-off from its parent, Marmon Holdings, Inc. in 2005 to the Pritzker family. On June 15, 2010, an affiliate of Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, on behalf of certain of its investment funds, acquired 51.0% of our outstanding common stock from the Pritzker family and certain employee and director stockholders of TransUnion Corp. On April 30, 2012, TransUnion Corp. was acquired by TransUnion Holding Company, Inc., substantially all the common stock of which was owned by Advent-TransUnion Acquisition Limited Partnership, and GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P., GS Capital Partners VI Parallel, L.P., Spartan Shield Holdings, GS Capital Partners Offshore Fund, L.P., GS Capital Partners VI GmbH & Co. KG, MBD 2011 Holding, L.P., Opportunity Partners Offshore-B Co-Invest AIV, L.P., and became TransUnion Holding Company, Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiary. On March 26, 2015, TransUnion Holding Company, Inc. was renamed TransUnion and TransUnion Corp. was renamed TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc. On June 30, 2015, we completed the initial public offering of 33,977,273 shares of our common stock, including shares sold to the underwriters pursuant to their over-allotment option, at a public offering price of $22.50 per share. Our stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “TRU.”
Legal and Regulatory Matters
Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is a top priority. We are subject to numerous laws governing the collection, protection, dissemination and use of the non-public personal information we have in our possession. These laws are enforced by U.S. federal, state and local regulatory agencies, foreign regulatory authorities and, in some instances, through private civil litigation. Our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our financial condition or overall operations.
We proactively manage our compliance with laws and regulations through a dedicated legal and compliance team that is generally locally sourced and tasked to ensure that enterprise standards are followed. To that end, we have legal and compliance personnel situated at business operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil, Colombia, Hong Kong, India and South Africa. All such personnel report to the functional department leaders, who are located in our corporate offices in Chicago, Illinois. Through the legal and compliance functions, we provide training to our associates, monitor all material laws and regulations, establish compliance policies, routinely review internal processes to determine whether business practice changes are warranted, assist in the development of new services, and promote regular meetings with principal regulators and legislators to establish transparency in our operations and create a means to understand and react should any issues arise.

U.S. Data and Privacy Protection
Our U.S. operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations that regulate, among other areas, privacy, data security, consumer protection and the use of consumer credit or an individual’s healthcare information. Certain of these laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized release of, or access to, this protected information. The laws and regulations that affect our U.S. business include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”): FCRA applies to consumer credit reporting agencies, including us, as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports. FCRA promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes. FCRA limits what information may be reported by consumer reporting agencies, limits the distribution and use of consumer reports, establishes consumer rights to access and dispute their own credit files, requires consumer reporting agencies to make a free annual credit report available to consumers and imposes many other requirements on consumer reporting agencies, data furnishers and users of consumer report information. Violation of FCRA can result in civil and criminal penalties. The law contains an attorney fee shifting provision to provide an incentive to consumers to bring individual or class action lawsuits against a consumer reporting agency for violations of FCRA. Regulatory enforcement of FCRA is under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another.


• | State Fair Credit Reporting Acts: Many states have enacted laws with requirements similar to FCRA. Some of these state laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than FCRA. FCRA preempts some of these state laws but the scope of preemption continues to be defined by the courts.


• | The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”): A central purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act is to “protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes.” Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB. The CFPB, through rulemaking, confirmed that the Company is subject to the examination and supervision of the CFPB, and such examinations began in 2012. In addition to transferring authority under certain existing laws to the CFPB and providing it with examination and supervisory authority, the Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) with respect to consumer financial products and provides the CFPB with authority to enforce those provisions. The CFPB has stated that its UDAAP authority may allow it to find statutory violations even where a specific regulation does not prohibit the relevant conduct, or prior published regulatory guidance or judicial interpretation has found the activity to be in accordance with law.


• | The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCPA”): In May 2018, Congress passed the EGRRCPA, which amended certain parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, FCRA and other U.S. federal laws applicable to us. Specifically, FCRA was amended to require that a credit reporting agency provide consumers with at least one year to submit a fraud alert to the credit reporting agency. The law also amended the FCRA for purposes of implementing a national security freeze that credit reporting agencies must provide free of charge upon formal request by a consumer. The credit freeze prevents credit reporting agencies from disclosing the content of a consumer report. Credit reporting agencies must also notify consumers of this right and provide instructions on how to implement and lift a credit freeze. The law increases veteran credit protection by implementing a process to remove inaccurate medical information and veteran medical debt and creates standards for verifying veteran medical debt. In addition, credit reporting agencies are required to provide free credit reporting monitoring, which requires notifying the consumer of any changes to his or her file, to any active duty military consumer.


• | State unfair and deceptive practices acts and practices laws: Many state have enacted statutes that prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices, relating to, among other things, marketing, disclosures and billing practices within the state or directed to consumers within the state. The Company and others in the industry may be subject to these laws with respect to the marketing of consumer credit information products.


• | Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (the “GLBA”): The GLBA regulates, among other things, the receipt, use and disclosure of non-public personal information of consumers that is held by financial institutions, including us. Several of our datasets are subject to GLBA provisions, including limitations on the use or disclosure of the underlying data and rules relating to the technological, physical and administrative safeguarding of non-public personal information. Violation of the GLBA can result in civil and criminal liability. Regulatory enforcement of the GLBA is under the purview of the FTC, the CFPB, the federal prudential banking regulators, the SEC and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with each other.


• | Drivers’ Privacy Protection Act (the “DPPA”): The DPPA requires all states to safeguard certain personal information included in licensed drivers’ motor vehicle records from improper use or disclosure. Protected information includes the driver’s name, address, phone number, Social Security Number, driver identification number, photograph, height, weight, gender, age, certain medical or disability information and, in some states, fingerprints, but does not include information on vehicular accidents, driving violations and driver’s status. The DPPA limits the use of this information sourced from State departments of motor vehicles to certain specified purposes, and does not apply if a driver has consented to the

15

release of their data. The DPPA imposes criminal fines for non-compliance and grants individuals a private right of action, including actual and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. The DPPA provides a federal baseline of protections for individuals, and is only partially preemptive, meaning that except in a few narrow circumstances, state legislatures may pass laws to supplement the protections made by the DPPA. Many States are more restrictive than the federal law.

• | Data security breach laws: All states have adopted data security breach laws that may require notice be given to affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information, and in some cases the provision of additional benefits such as free credit monitoring to affected individuals. Some of these laws require additional data protection measures over and above the GLBA data safeguarding requirements. If data within our system is compromised by a breach, we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws, including regulatory investigations or enforcement actions from state attorneys general, who enforce state data breach or unfair and deceptive practices laws.


• | Identity theft laws: Under the federal EGRRCPA, consumers can place a security freeze on their credit reports to prevent others from opening new accounts or obtaining new credit in their name and obtain one-year of fraud alerts free of charge. In addition, most states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that give consumers the right to place a security freeze on their credit report. Generally, these state laws require us to respond to requests for a freeze within a certain period of time, to send certain notices or confirmations to consumers in connection with a security freeze and to unfreeze files upon request within a specified time period.


• | Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”): The FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. We must comply with the FTC Act when we market our services, such as consumer credit monitoring services through our Consumer Interactive segment. Our data collection, use and disclosure practices and the security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers could also be subject to the FTC Act, and our data practices or our failure to safeguard data adequately may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action. There is no private right of action under the FTC Act.


• | The Credit Repair Organizations Act (“CROA”): CROA regulates companies that claim to be able to assist consumers in improving their credit standing. Some courts have applied CROA to credit monitoring services offered by consumer reporting agencies and others. CROA allows for a private right of action and permits consumers to recover all money paid for alleged “credit repair” services in the event of violation. We, and others in our industry, have settled purported consumer class actions alleging violations of CROA without admitting or denying liability.


• | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”): HIPAA and HITECH require companies to implement reasonable safeguards to prevent intentional or unintentional misuse or wrongful disclosure of protected health information. In connection with receiving data from and providing services to healthcare providers, we may handle data subject to HIPAA and HITECH requirements. We obtain protected health information from healthcare providers and payers of healthcare claims that are subject to the privacy, security and transactional requirements imposed by HIPAA. We are frequently required to secure HIPAA-compliant “business associate” agreements with the providers and payers who supply data to us. As a business associate, we are obligated to limit our use and disclosure of health-related data to certain statutorily permitted purposes, HIPAA regulations, as outlined in our business associate agreements, and to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data. HIPAA and HITECH also require, in certain circumstances, the reporting of breaches of protected health information to affected individuals and to the United States Department of Health and Human Services. A violation of any of the terms of a business associate agreement or noncompliance with HIPAA or HITECH data privacy or security requirements could result in administrative enforcement action and/or imposition of statutory penalties by the United States Department of Health and Human Services or a state Attorney General. HIPAA and HITECH requirements supplement but do not preempt state laws regulating the use and disclosure of health-related information; state law remedies, which can include a private right of action, remain available to individuals affected by an impermissible use or disclosure of health-related data.

We are also subject to U.S. federal and state laws that are generally applicable to any U.S. business with national or international operations, such as antitrust laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and various employment laws. We continuously monitor U.S. federal and state legislative and regulatory activities that involve credit reporting, data privacy and security, and other relevant subjects to identify issues in order to remain in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
International Data and Privacy Protection
We are subject to data protection, privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we conduct business. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | United Kingdom: Data Protection Act (the “DPA”) and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulation (the “PECR”) - The DPA is the key legislation that governs all credit reporting agency (“CRA”) activities and the PECR compliments it, setting out more specific privacy rights on electronic communications. PECR was most recently amended in 2016, limiting use cases of personal data for prospecting/origination purposes. The provision of credit referencing 

16

services is a regulated activity which is authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”). The FCA has regulated CRAs since 2014 with the objectives of protecting consumers, protecting financial markets and promoting competition. Callcredit, Experian and Equifax were granted full FCA authorization in early 2016. The Information Commissioners Office (the “ICO”) is an independent body set up to uphold information rights, and oversees the DPA and the PECR. In addition to the DPA and the PECR, there are two key changes to be implemented within the regulatory environment: the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”); and Open Banking. Overall these changes are expected to have a neutral to positive impact on the CRA market. GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018, aims to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the European Union, and will replace the existing DPA. The GDPR will change the way personal data can be used and gives individuals significantly more power to access their information, bolsters consumers rights around automated processing of data (i.e., lenders will be required to provide an explanation on decisions), and also gives individuals the power to get their personal data erased if it is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected, if consent is withdrawn, or if it was unlawfully processed. Ultimately, the GDPR will increase the cost of customer data management and data collection due to more rigorous regulations. Data retention periods are already defined and deletions automated so there will be no impact to CRA’s operations. The GDPR will enable the ICO to fine non-compliant businesses. The GDPR states offenses could result in fines up 2% to 4% of a firm’s global revenue, depending on severity of the offense. TransUnion was already subject to the GDPR and is working to become fully compliant. Open Banking aims to improve customer experience and to increase competition in the banking sector. Consumers can share transaction data with third parties via application program interfaces (“APIs”) to identify best products and take up multi-bank products. As part of Open Banking, the Second Payment Services Directive came in effect in January 2018 and affects the payments industry, allowing merchants to retrieve a customer’s account data from their bank with their consent. The implementation of Open Banking platforms will increase the number of payment service providers available to consumers and will expand beyond traditional banks. 

• | South Africa: National Credit Act of 2005 (the “NCA”) - The NCA and its implementing regulations govern credit bureaus and consumer credit information. The NCA sets standards for filing, retaining and reporting consumer credit information. The NCA also defines consumers’ rights with respect to accessing their own information and addresses the process for disputing information in a credit file. The NCA is enforced by The National Credit Regulator who has authority to supervise and examine credit bureaus.


• | Canada: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act of 2000 (“PIPEDA”) - The PIPEDA and substantially similar provincial laws govern how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities. The PIPEDA gives individuals the right to access and request correction of their personal information collected by such organizations. The PIPEDA requires compliance with the Canadian Standard Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. Most Canadian provinces also have laws dealing with consumer reporting. These laws typically impose an obligation on credit reporting agencies to have reasonable processes in place to maintain the accuracy of the information, place limits on the disclosure of the information and give consumers the right to have access to, and challenge the accuracy of, the information.


• | India: Credit Information Companies Regulation Act of 2005 (“CICRA”) - The CICRA requires entities that collect and maintain personal credit information to ensure that it is complete, accurate and protected. Entities must adopt certain privacy principles in relation to collecting, processing, preserving, sharing and using credit information. In addition, India has privacy legislation that would allow individuals to sue for damages in the case of a data breach, if the entity negligently failed to implement “reasonable security practices and procedures” to protect personal data.


• | Hong Kong: Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (“PDPO”) and The Code of Practice on Consumer Credit Data (“COPCCD”) - The PDPO and the COPCCD regulate the operation of consumer credit reference agencies. They prescribe the methods and security controls under which credit providers and credit reference agencies may collect, access and manage credit data. In April 2011, the COPCCD was amended to permit credit providers to share limited positive mortgage payment data. In June 2012, the PDPO was amended to increase penalties and create criminal liabilities for repeat contravention of PDPO under which enforcement notices have been served.


• | Colombia: The Colombian Financial Data Protection Regime (Law 1266 of 2008) regulates the collection, use and transfer of personal data pertaining to financial services, including credit reporting. The Colombian General Data Protection Regime (Law 1581 of 2012 and Decree 1377 of 2013) covers regulation of all other personal data. Both of these regimes have applicability to credit reporting services in Colombia and together address obligations of information furnishers, database owners, consumer right of access, consumer consent and permitted information disclosures. Regulatory enforcement primarily rests with the Financial Superintendence of Colombia and the Colombia Data Protection Authority (Superintendence of Industry and Commerce). 

We are also subject to various laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses in the other countries where we operate.
