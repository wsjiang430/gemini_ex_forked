Item 1. Business
Overview
Griffon Corporation (the “Company” or “Griffon”, "we", "us") is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company was founded in 1959, is a Delaware corporation headquartered in New York, N.Y. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:GFF).
Business Strategy
We own and operate, and seek to acquire, businesses in multiple industries and geographic markets. Our objective is to maintain leading positions in the markets we serve by providing innovative, branded products with superior quality and industry-leading service. We place emphasis on our iconic and well-respected brands, which helps to differentiate us and our offerings from our competitors and strengthens our relationship with our customers and those who ultimately use our products.
Through operating a diverse portfolio of businesses, we expect to reduce variability caused by external factors such as market cyclicality, seasonality, and weather. We achieve diversity by providing various product offerings and brands through multiple sales and distribution channels, and conducting business across multiple countries which we consider our home markets. 
Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. As long-term investors, having substantial experience in a variety of industries, our intent is to continue the growth and strengthening of our existing businesses, and to diversify further through investments in our businesses and through acquisitions.
As described in greater detail below, over the past three years, we have undertaken a series of transformative transactions. This year we integrated our most significant acquisitions into our wholly owned subsidiaries, The AMES Companies, Inc. ("AMES") and Clopay Corporation ("Clopay"), expanding the scope of both AMES and Clopay. In particular, CornellCookson has been integrated into Clopay, so that our leading company in residential garage doors and sectional commercial doors now includes a leading manufacturer of rolling steel doors and grille products. ClosetMaid was combined with AMES, and we established an integrated headquarters for AMES in Orlando, Florida. AMES is now positioned to fulfill its mission of Bringing Brands Together™ with the leading brands in home and garage organization, outdoor décor, and lawn, garden and cleaning tools. As a result of the expanded scope of the AMES and Clopay businesses, we now report each as a separate segment. Clopay remains in the Home and Building Products segment and AMES now constitutes our new Consumer and Professional Products segment.
Business Highlights
On September 5, 2017, Griffon announced the acquisition of ClosetMaid LLC ("ClosetMaid") and the commencement of the strategic alternatives process for Clopay Plastic Products, beginning the transformation of Griffon. 
In October 2017, we acquired ClosetMaid from Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) for an effective purchase price of approximately $165,000. ClosetMaid, founded in 1965, is a leading North American manufacturer and marketer of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage and wire garage storage products, and sells to some of the largest home center retail chains, mass merchandisers, and direct-to-builder professional installers in North America. We believe that ClosetMaid is the leading brand in its category, with excellent consumer recognition.
In February 2018, we closed on the sale of our Clopay Plastics Products ("Plastics") business to Berry Global, Inc. ("Berry") for approximately $465,000, net of certain post-closing adjustments, thus exiting the specialty plastics industry that the Company had entered when it acquired Clopay Corporation in 1986. This transaction provided immediate liquidity and positions the Company to improve its cash flow conversion given the historically higher capital needs of the Plastics operations as compared to Griffon’s remaining businesses.
In March 2018, we announced the combination of the ClosetMaid operations with those of AMES. ClosetMaid generated over $300,000 in revenue in the first twelve months after the acquisition, and we anticipate the integration with AMES will unlock additional value given the complementary products, customers, warehousing and distribution, manufacturing, and sourcing capabilities of the two businesses.
In June 2018, Clopay acquired CornellCookson, Inc. ("CornellCookson"), a leading provider of rolling steel service doors, fire doors, and grilles, for an effective purchase price of approximately $170,000. This transaction strengthened Clopay's strategic portfolio with a line of commercial rolling steel door products to complement Clopay's sectional door offerings in the commercial industry, and expands the Clopay network of professional dealers focused on the commercial market. CornellCookson generated over $200,000 in revenue in its first full year of operations.
During fiscal 2017 and 2018, Griffon also completed a number of other acquisitions to expand and enhance AMES' global footprint. In the United Kingdom, Griffon acquired La Hacienda, an outdoor living brand of unique heating and garden décor products, in July 2017, and Kelkay, a manufacturer and distributor of decorative outdoor landscaping, in February 2018. These two businesses provided AMES with additional brands and a platform for growth in the UK market and give access to leading garden centers, retailers, and grocers in the UK and Ireland.
In Australia, Griffon acquired Hills Home Living, the iconic brand of clotheslines and home products, from Hills Limited (ASX:HIL) in December 2016. In September 2017, Griffon acquired Tuscan Path, an Australian provider of pots, planters, pavers, decorative stone, and garden décor products. These acquisitions broadened AMES' outdoor living and lawn and garden business, strengthening AMES’ portfolio of brands and its market position in Australia and New Zealand.
In November 2017, Griffon acquired Harper Brush Works, a leading U.S. manufacturer of cleaning products for professional, home, and industrial use, from Horizon Global (NYSE:HZN). This acquisition expanded the AMES line of long-handle tools in North America to include brooms, brushes, and other cleaning products.
We believe these actions have established a solid foundation for continuing organic growth in sales, profit, and cash generation and bolsters Griffon’s platforms for opportunistic strategic acquisitions.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Griffon modified its reportable segment structure to provide investors with improved visibility after a series of portfolio repositioning actions which included the divestiture of the Plastics business, the acquisition of ClosetMaid and its subsequent integration into AMES, and the acquisition of CornellCookson by Clopay. Griffon now reports its operations through three reportable segments: the newly formed Consumer and Professional Products segment, which consists of AMES; Home and Building Products, which consists of Clopay; and Defense Electronics, which consists of Telephonics Corporation. 
Further Information
Griffon posts and makes available, free of charge through its website at www.griffon.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as press releases, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are published or filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The information found on Griffon's website is not part of this or any other report it files with or furnishes to the SEC.

Rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail use are sold under the CornellCookson brand. 


• | Defense Electronics conducts its operations through Telephonics Corporation ("Telephonics"), founded in 1933, a globally recognized leading provider of highly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and communications solutions for defense, aerospace and commercial customers.

Reportable Segments:

CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS
The CPP segment consists of AMES. Founded in Massachusetts in 1774, AMES has the distinction of being one of the oldest companies in continuous operation in the United States. Over its long life, AMES has grown organically and through the acquisition of other leading and historic tool businesses such as True Temper, Union Tools, and Garant. Today, AMES is the leading manufacturer of long-handled tools and landscaping products for homeowners and professionals in North America, and also provides these products in key global markets including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. With the addition of ClosetMaid, AMES is also the leading provider of wood and wire closet organization, general living storage, and wire garage storage products in the United States. 
Since being acquired by Griffon in 2010, AMES has benefited from strategic acquisitions that have expanded its product portfolio and geographic presence. The ClosetMaid, Southern Patio, and Harper Brush Works acquisitions added to AMES' product categories in North America to include storage and organization, decorative landscaping, and cleaning products. The acquisitions of Northcote, Cyclone, Hills, and Tuscan Path in Australia established AMES as a leading supplier of tools and landscaping categories in the Australian market. As a result of the acquisitions of Kelkay and La Hacienda, the United Kingdom and Ireland has become a new key market for AMES products. 
AMES has approximately 3,700 employees worldwide.

Brands
AMES' brands are among the most recognized across its primary product categories in North America, Australia and the United Kingdom. Its brand portfolio for long-handled tools , outdoor décor, and landscaping product includes AMES®, True Temper®, Garant®, Harper®, UnionTools®, Westmix™, Cyclone®, Southern Patio®, Northcote Pottery™, Nylex®, Hills®, Kelkay®, Tuscan Path®, La Hacienda®, Kelso™, and Dynamic Design®™. Contractor-oriented tool brands include Razor-Back® Professional Tools and Jackson® Professional Tools. AMES' home organization, general living storage, and garage storage products are sold primarily under the ClosetMaid® brand. 
This strong portfolio of brands enables AMES to build and maintain long-standing relationships with leading retailers and distributors. In addition, given the breadth of its brand portfolio and product category depth, AMES is able to offer specific, differentiated branding strategies for key retail customers. These strategies have focused on enhancement of brand value, with the goal of de-commoditizing AMES products through the introduction of identity and functionality elements that will make each top brand unique, attractive and visually recognizable by the consumer. The visual brand transformation of the AMES® and Razor-Back® brands was completed in 2015, and the True Temper® line roll-out was completed in 2016. In addition to the brands listed, AMES also sells private label branded products, further differentiating AMES in its customer offerings.
Products

AMES manufactures and markets a broad portfolio of long-handled tools, landscaping products, and home organization products. This portfolio contains many iconic brands and is anchored by five core product categories: seasonal outdoor tools, project tools, outdoor décor and watering, home organization, and cleaning products. As a result of brand portfolio recognition, high product quality, industry leading service and strong customer relationships, AMES has earned market-leading positions in its five core product categories. The following is a brief description of AMES' primary product lines:

• | Seasonal Outdoor Tools

Customers
AMES sells products throughout North America, Australia, New Zealand and Europe through (1) home centers, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (“Home Depot”), Lowe’s Companies Inc. (“Lowe’s”), Rona Inc., Bunnings Warehouse ("Bunnings") and Woodies (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being approximately 30 years); (2) mass market, specialty, and hardware retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ("Walmart"), Target Corporation ("Target"), Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited ("Canadian Tire"), Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco"), Ace, Do-It-Best and True Value Company; (3) industrial distributors, such as W.W. Grainger, Inc. and ORS Nasco, and (4) homebuilders, such as D.R. Horton, KB Home, Lennar and NVR, Inc. 

Home Depot, Lowe's and Bunnings are significant customers of AMES. The loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the AMES business and on Griffon.

Product Development

AMES product development efforts focus on both new products and product line extensions. AMES continually improves existing products as well as develops new products to satisfy consumer needs, expand revenue opportunities, maintain or extend competitive advantages, increase market share and reduce production costs. Products are developed through in-house industrial design and engineering staffs to introduce new products and product line extensions that are timely and cost effective.
Sales and Marketing

AMES' sales organization is structured by distribution channel in the U.S., and by country internationally. In the U.S., a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for each of the large retail customers. Offices are maintained adjacent to each of the two largest customers’ headquarters, supported by a shared in-house sales analyst. In addition, sales professionals are assigned to domestic, wholesale and industrial distribution channels. Sales teams located in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland handle sales in each of their respective regions. In Australia, a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for the largest retail customer.
Raw Materials and Suppliers

AMES' primary raw material inputs include resin (primarily polypropylene and high density polyethylene), wood (particleboard and hardwoods including ash, hickory and poplar logs) and steel (hot rolled, cold rolled, and wire rod). All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources. Certain components are purchased, such as heavy forged components and wheelbarrow tires. Most final assembly is completed internally in order to ensure consistent quality. AMES also sources some finished goods. 
Competition

The long-handled tools and landscaping product industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Most competitors consist of small, privately-held companies focusing on a single product category. Some competitors, such as Fiskars Corporation in the hand tool and pruning tool market and Truper Herramientas S.A. de C.V. in the long-handled and garden tool space, compete in various tool categories. Suncast Corporation competes in the hose reel and accessory market, and more recently in the long-handled plastic snow shovel category and Swan Hose competes in the garden hose market. In addition, there is competition from imported or sourced products from China, India and other low-cost producing countries, particularly in long-handled tools, wheelbarrows, planters, striking tools and pruning tools.

The home storage and organizational solutions industry is also highly fragmented. AMES, primarily under the ClosetMaid brands, sells through retail, direct to consumer (e-commerce category) and direct to installer (building) channels and competes with a significant number of companies across each of these unique channels. Principal competition for retail wire products is from Newell Brands, Inc. through their Rubbermaid® product line. FirstService Brands, Inc. sells competing wood solutions under the brand California Closets®, but does not sell through the retail or direct to consumer channels. We believe that AMES' market share in the U.S. is approximately double that of its largest competitors in the home storage and organizational solutions product category. 
AMES differentiates itself and provides the best value to customers through its successful history of innovation, dependable supply chain and high on-time delivery rates, quality, product performance, and highly recognized product brands. AMES' size, depth and breadth of product offering, category knowledge, research and development (“R&D”) investment, service and its ability to react to sudden changes in demand from seasonal weather patterns, especially during harsh winter months, are competitive advantages. Offshore manufacturers lack sufficient product innovation, capacity, proximity to market and distribution capabilities to service large retailers or to compete in highly seasonal, weather related product categories.
Manufacturing & Distribution

AMES has a combination of internal and external, and domestic and foreign, manufacturing sources from which it sources products for sale in the markets it serves. Principal manufacturing facilities include 644,000 square feet of manufacturing operations in Harrisburg and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, a 676,000 square foot facility in Ocala, Florida, and a 353,000 square foot manufacturing center in St. Francois, Quebec, Canada. AMES operates smaller manufacturing facilities at several other locations in the United States, and internationally in Reynosa, Mexico; Jiangmen, China; and Grafton, New South Wales and Wonthaggi, Victoria, both in Australia. 
AMES has two principal distribution facilities in the United States, a 1.2 million square foot facility in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and a 400,000 square foot facility in Reno, Nevada. Finished goods are transported to these facilities from AMES' manufacturing sites by both an internal fleet, as well as over the road trucking and rail. Additionally, light assembly is performed at the Carlisle and Reno locations. Smaller distribution centers are also strategically located in the U.S. in Ocala, Florida, Chino, California, Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania and Pharr, Texas, and internationally in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
HOME AND BUILDING PRODUCTS

The HBP segment consists of Clopay. Founded in 1964 and acquired by Griffon in 1986, Clopay has grown organically and through acquisitions to become the largest manufacturer and marketer of garage doors and rolling steel doors in North America. Clopay also manufactures a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles. The majority of Clopay's sales come from home remodeling and renovation projects, with the balance from commercial construction and new residential housing construction. Sales into the home remodeling market are driven by the aging of the housing stock, existing home sales activity, and the trends of improving both home appearance and energy efficiency. 

On June 4, 2018, Clopay acquired CornellCookson, a leading U.S. manufacturer and marketer of rolling steel door and grille products designed for commercial, industrial, institutional and retail use, for $180,000, excluding certain post-closing adjustments. After taking into account estimated tax benefits resulting from the transaction, the effective purchase price was $170,000, subject to certain adjustments. CornellCookson was founded in 1828 as Cornell Iron Works and, in 2008, purchased the Cookson Company, which was founded in 1938, to form CornellCookson. The acquisition of CornellCookson expands Clopay’s existing footprint in the commercial door market and strengthens relationships with professional dealers and installers. Clopay had previously partnered with CornellCookson on customer solutions for over eight years. Consolidating the companies allows Clopay to broaden its existing portfolio of brands, products and customers to serve the commercial market more efficiently with multiple types of doors, and creates additional opportunity to expand our position in adjacent markets. Similar distribution and product composition between the businesses also allows for potential cost savings opportunities across distribution networks and through commodity purchasing.
Clopay has approximately 2,700 employees.
Brands

Clopay brings over 50 years of experience and innovation to the residential and sectional garage door industry, and has over 100 years of experience in the rolling steel industry. Residential and commercial sectional products are sold under market-leading brands including Clopay®, America’s Favorite Garage Doors®, Holmes Garage Door Company® and IDEAL Door®. Clopay commercial rolling steel door brands include Cornell®, Cookson®, CornellCookson® and Clopay®. 
Products and Service

Clopay manufactures a broad line of residential sectional garage doors with a variety of options, at varying prices. Clopay offers garage doors made primarily from steel, plastic composite and wood, and also sells related products, such as garage door openers manufactured by third parties. Clopay also offers a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles.

Commercial door products manufactured and marketed by Clopay include rolling steel service doors, fire doors, and shutters, steel security grilles, and room dividers. Clopay also manufactures and markets commercial sectional doors, which are similar to residential garage doors, but are designed to meet the more demanding performance specifications of a commercial application.

Customers

Clopay is currently the exclusive supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America to Home Depot and Menards. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on Clopay and Griffon. Clopay distributes its garage doors directly to customers from its manufacturing facilities and through its distribution centers located throughout the U.S. and Canada. These distribution centers allow Clopay to maintain an inventory of garage doors near installing dealers and provide quick-ship service to retail and professional dealer customers.
Product Development

Clopay product development efforts focus on both new products and improvements to existing products. Products are developed through in-house design and engineering staffs.

Clopay operates technical development centers where its research engineers design and develop new products and technologies and perform durability and performance testing of new and existing products, materials and finishes. Clopay continually improves its door offerings through these development efforts, focusing on characteristics such as strength, design, operating performance and durability, and energy efficiency. The process engineering teams also work to develop new manufacturing processes and production techniques aimed at improving manufacturing efficiencies and ensuring quality-made products.
 Sales and Marketing

The Clopay sales and marketing organization supports our customers, consults on new product development and aggressively markets door solutions, with a primary focus on the North American market. Clopay maintains a strong promotional presence, in both traditional and digital media. 
Clopay customers utilize a proprietary residential door web application, the MyDoor® mobile enabled app, that guides consumers through an easy to use visualization and pricing program, allowing them to select the optimal door for their home. For Clopay's commercial products, Clopay's Commercial Door Quoter (CDQ®™) and CornellCookson's WebGen™ systems are available to assist our professional dealers streamline their quoting and submittal process for greater productivity and backroom efficiency improvement. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers

The principal raw material used in Clopay's manufacturing is galvanized steel. Clopay also utilizes certain hardware components, as well as wood and insulated foam. All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources.
Competition

The sectional garage door and commercial rolling steel door industry includes several large national manufacturers and many smaller, regional and local manufacturers. Clopay competes on the basis of service, quality, price, brand awareness and product design.

Clopay brand names are widely recognized in the building products industry. Clopay believes that it has earned a reputation among installing dealers and retailers for producing a broad range of innovative, high-quality doors with industry leading lead times. Clopay's market position and brand recognition are key marketing tools for expanding its customer base, leveraging its distribution network and increasing its market share.

Manufacturing

On January 31, 2019, Clopay announced a $14,000 investment in facilities infrastructure and equipment at its rolling steel manufacturing location in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania.  This project includes a 90,000 square foot expansion to the already existing 184,000 square foot facility, along with the addition of state of the art manufacturing equipment.  Through this expansion, the Mountain Top location will improve its manufacturing efficiency and shipping operations, as well as increase manufacturing capacity to support full-rate production of new and core products. The project is expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2019. 
Distribution

Clopay distributes its products through a wide range of distribution channels, including a national network of 51 distribution centers. Additionally, products are sold to over 2,500 independent professional installing dealers and to major home center retail chains including Home Depot and Menards (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being greater than 25 years). Clopay maintains strong relationships with its installing dealers and believes it is the largest supplier of sectional garage doors to the retail and professional installing channels in North America and the largest supplier of rolling steel door products in North America. Clopay is currently the exclusive supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America to Home Depot and Menards.
DEFENSE ELECTRONICS

Defense Electronics consists of Telephonics Corporation ("Telephonics"). Founded in 1933, Telephonics is recognized globally as a leading provider of highly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and communications solutions that are deployed across a wide range of land, sea and air applications. Telephonics designs, develops, manufactures and provides logistical support and lifecycle sustainment services to defense, aerospace and commercial customers worldwide. In 2019, approximately 63% of the segment’s sales were to the U.S. Government and agencies thereof, as a prime or subcontractor, 32% to international customers and 5% to U.S. commercial customers. Telephonics is headquartered in Farmingdale, New York and currently has approximately 900 employees.
The U.S. defense budget for government fiscal year (GFY) 2020 is set at $718 billion with the President's defense budget request including major growth to most mission areas. This represents a $33 billion, or 5% increase over the GFY 2019 defense budget 
of $685 billion. Budgets through GFY 2024 increase with a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of approximately 1% over the GFY 2020 baseline budget level. 
Internationally, demand is growing due to major system capability upgrades in existing systems and re-capitalization of aging assets. Industry reports indicate global defense spending to grow with a CAGR of about 3.5% over the 2016-2026 periods. The U.S. is the largest exporter of defense equipment in the world, and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future, with significant increases in defense budgets expected in countries that have historically imported defense products from the U.S. such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Taiwan, Australia, India, South Korea and Japan, among others. 
Domestic and international defense market trends bode well for business opportunities for Telephonics products supporting Imaging and Surveillance Radar Systems, Communications, Surveillance and Border Surveillance.

Telephonics has also invested in design and development of technologies focused on advanced intelligence and surveillance sensors with applications in both manned and unmanned systems, as well as border and perimeter security markets. 

Telephonics is a partner in Mahindra Telephonics Integrated Systems, a Joint Venture (JV) with Mahindra Defense Systems in India. The business is focused on providing the Indian defense and civil sectors with surveillance, communications and IFF systems. The JV also intends to provide air traffic management (ATM), border and perimeter security and other surveillance technologies to meet emerging demands.
Programs and Products

Based on long-established relationships supported by existing contractual arrangements, Telephonics is a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin", which includes Sikorsky Aircraft), The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrop Grumman"), Oshkosh Corporation ("Oshkosh"), Airbus Military, Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo (AgustaWestland) Helicopters, and SAAB (with the average length of the relationship with these customers being greater than 20 years), and is a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense and FAA. The significance of each of these customers to Telephonics’ revenue fluctuates on an annual basis, based on the timing and funding of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) contract award, and the technological scope of the work required. Key products include maritime radars, identification friend or foe systems, mobile surveillance and communication systems. The significant contraction and consolidation in the U.S. and international defense industry provides opportunities for established first-tier suppliers to capitalize on existing relationships with major prime contractors and to play a larger role in defense systems development and procurement for the foreseeable future.
Telephonics successfully leveraged its core Surveillance technologies to develop a solution, now fielded by the FAA as a part of the Common Terminal Digitizer (CTD) program, at numerous air surveillance radar sites across the United States. Telephonics expects to continue to leverage its technology to improve the value proposition offered to future FAA radar infrastructure upgrade programs.

Telephonics continues to direct resources towards border surveillance and critical infrastructure security initiatives. These opportunities represent strategic advances for Telephonics by enabling it to expand its core technical expertise into the nascent and growing border and perimeter security markets, both in the U.S. and abroad. With many of these programs, system specifications and operational and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by demanding delivery schedules. Telephonics believes that the technological capabilities these systems encompass will also be able to serve and protect the most complex borders.

Backlog
The funded backlog for Telephonics approximated $389,300 at September 30, 2019, compared to $374,200 at September 30, 2018 (restated for the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on October 1, 2018). Approximately 72% of the current backlog is expected to be filled during 2020.
Backlog represents the dollar value of funded orders for which work has not been performed. Backlog generally increases with bookings and converts into revenue as we incur costs related to contractual commitments or the shipment of product. The decrease in backlog was primarily attributed to the timing of various international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities that were not received by the end of the reporting period. Given the nature of our business and a larger dependency on international customers, our bookings, and therefore our backlog, is impacted by the longer maturation cycles resulting in 
delays in the timing and amounts of such awards, which are subject to numerous factors, including fiscal constraints placed on customer budgets; political uncertainty; the timing of customer negotiations; and the timing of governmental approvals. 
Customers

The U.S. Government, through prime contractors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing and Oshkosh, is a significant customer of Telephonics. The loss of the U.S. Government or any of its prime contractors as a customer could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ business. Notwithstanding the significance of Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, Telephonics sells to a diverse group of other domestic and international defense industry contractors, as well as others who use Telephonics products for commercial use.

Telephonics participates in a range of long-term defense and non-military government programs, both in the U.S. and internationally. Telephonics has developed a base of installed products that generate significant recurring revenue from product enhancements and retrofits, as well as providing spare parts and customer support. Due to the inherent complexity of these electronic systems, Telephonics believes that its incumbent status on major platforms provides a competitive advantage in the selection process for platform upgrades and enhancements. Furthermore, Telephonics believes that its ability to leverage and apply its advanced technology to new platforms provides a competitive advantage when bidding for new business.

Research and Development (R&D)

In order to continue to offer affordable and technologically advanced solutions that provide relevant and required features, Telephonics works closely with prime customers to ensure that there is a future market for its products by investing R&D funds in desired enhancements. Telephonics continually updates its core technologies through internally funded R&D while coordinating with customers at the earliest stages of new program development in an effort to provide solutions well in advance of its competitors. Internally funded R&D costs include basic and applied research initiatives, development activities, and other conceptual formulation studies. Telephonics is a technological leader in its core markets and pursues new growth opportunities by leveraging its systems design and engineering capabilities, and incumbent position, on key platforms.

In addition to products for defense programs, Telephonics' technology is also used in commercial applications such as airborne weather, search and rescue radar, and air traffic management systems. Telephonics’ reputation for innovative product design and engineering capabilities, especially in the areas of voice and data communications, radio frequency design, digital signal processing, networking systems, inverse synthetic aperture radar and analog, and digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, will continue to enhance its ability to secure, retain and expand its participation in defense programs and commercial opportunities.

Telephonics often designs its products to exceed customers’ minimum specifications, providing its customers with greater performance, flexibility, and value. Telephonics believes that early participation and communication with its customers in the requirements definition stages of new program development increases the likelihood that its products will be selected and integrated as part of a total system solution.
Telephonics is currently investing in an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) based radar solution to address emerging requirements in the maritime and overland radar markets. Continued investments in the Surveillance product portfolio are expected to result in market penetration opportunities in the ground tactical markets with small form factor passive and active IFF solutions. In addition, development of SkySearch-2020, a next generation Mode S Beacon system, is expected to enable Telephonics to continue pursuing FAA opportunities that align with its core competencies and technologies. Investments in the Communications Systems business line are focused on supporting pilot effectiveness initiatives by addressing cognitive overload conditions through innovative adaptive aural processing algorithms. 
Sales and Marketing

Telephonics has technical business development personnel who act as the focal point for its marketing activities and sales representatives who introduce its products and systems to customers worldwide.
Competition

Telephonics competes with major manufacturers of electronic information and communication systems, as well as several smaller manufacturers of similar products. Telephonics endeavors to design high quality and reliable products with greater performance and flexibility than its competitors while competing on the basis of technology, innovative solutions, and price.
Manufacturing Facilities

Telephonics’ facilities are located in the U.S., primarily in New York. Telephonics also maintains a Technical Support Services Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which supports aircraft integration and upgrade activities in addition to providing support services to customers.
Clopay Plastic Products - Discontinued Operations
On February 6, 2018, we completed the sale of our Plastics business to Berry Global Group, Inc. for approximately $465,000, net of certain post-closing adjustments. As a result, Griffon classified the results of operations of the Plastics business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented and classified the related assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. All results and information presented exclude Plastics unless otherwise noted. Plastics is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies. See Note 7, Discontinued Operations.
Griffon Corporation

Employees

As of September 30, 2019, Griffon and its subsidiaries employ approximately 7,300 people located primarily throughout the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico and China. Approximately 200 of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the U.S., with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations), and the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union. Additionally, approximately 200 employees in Canada are represented by the Trade Union Advisory Committee. Griffon believes its relationships with its employees are satisfactory. 
Generally, the total number of employees of Griffon and its subsidiaries does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity or the opening of new branches or lines of business may increase the number of employees or fluctuations in the level of Griffon's business activity, which could in turn require staffing level adjustments in response to actual or anticipated customer demand.
Regulation

Griffon’s operations are subject to various environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations. Griffon believes that it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with environmental laws has not materially affected, and is not expected to materially affect, Griffon’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Nevertheless, Griffon cannot guarantee that, in the future, it will not incur additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material.

Telephonics, which sells directly and indirectly to the U.S. government, is subject to certain regulations, laws and standards set by the U.S. government. Additionally, Telephonics is subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, and other Inspectors General. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems.
Customers

A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon’s consolidated revenue from continuing operations. In 2019:

a. | The U.S. Government and its agencies, through prime and subcontractor relationships, represented 10% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue and 63% of Defense Electronics' revenue.
b. | Home Depot represented 18% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue, 28% of CPP's revenue and 13% of HBP's revenue. 


No other customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers and Griffon's relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon’s financial results, liquidity and operations.
Seasonality

Griffon’s revenue and income are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in our second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality within the AMES and Clopay businesses. In 2019, 56% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 55% in 2018 and 2017. Clopay’s business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter. Defense Electronics revenue is generally driven by the delivery requirements of its customers, accordingly, Defense Electronics will often have increased revenue in the latter half of the year due to the U.S. government's annual budget cycle.
Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during peak gardening season. AMES' sales volume can be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Segment and operating results are included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

For geographic financial information, see the Reportable Segment footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Griffon’s non-U.S. businesses are primarily in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and China.

Research and Development

Griffon’s businesses are encouraged to improve existing products as well as develop new products to satisfy customer needs; expand revenue opportunities; maintain or extend competitive advantages; increase market share and reduce production costs. R&D costs, not recoverable under contractual arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred. 
Intellectual Property

Griffon follows a practice of actively protecting and enforcing its proprietary rights in the U.S. and throughout the world where Griffon’s products are sold. All intellectual property information presented in this section is as of September 30, 2019.
Trademarks are of significant importance to Griffon’s AMES and Clopay businesses. With 50 years of experience and innovation in the garage door industry, and over 100 years of experience in the rolling steel door industry, Clopay has a significant level of goodwill in its strong family of brands, including: Clopay®, America’s Favorite Doors®; Holmes Garage Door Company®; IDEAL Door®; and the Cornell®, Cookson®, and CornellCookson® commercial door brands. Principal global and regional trademarks used by AMES for its tool and landscape products include AMES®, True Temper®, Garant®, Harper®, UnionTools®, Westmix™, Cyclone®, Southern Patio®, Northcote Pottery™, Nylex®, Hills®, Kelkay®, Tuscan Path®, La Hacienda®, Kelso™, and Dynamic Design®, as well as contractor-oriented brands including Razor-Back® Professional Tools and Jackson® Professional Tools. Storage and home organization brands within AMES include ClosetMaid®, MasterSuite®, Suite Symphony®, Cubeicals®, ExpressShelf®, SpaceCreations®, Maximum Load®, SuperSlide® and ShelfTrack®. The AMES and Clopay businesses have approximately 1,000 registered trademarks and approximately 250 pending trademark applications around the world. Griffon’s rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and registered.
Patents are also important to the AMES and Clopay businesses. Clopay holds approximately 35 issued patents and 25 pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as approximately 10 and 20 corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, primarily related to garage door system components and operation. AMES protects its designs and product innovation through the use of patents, and currently has approximately 325 issued patents and approximately 50 pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as approximately 300 and 25 corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, respectively. Design patents are generally 
valid for fourteen years, and utility patents are generally valid for twenty years, from the date of filing. Griffon's patents are in various stages of their terms of validity.
In the government and defense business, formal intellectual property rights are of limited value. Therefore, the Telephonics business tends to hold most of its important intellectual property as trade secrets, which it protects through the use of contract terms and carefully restricting access to its technology.
Environmental, Social and Governance 
We take into account environmental considerations in the management of our businesses.  For example, our newly constructed headquarters for AMES is largely constructed from recycled materials, much of which was scrap material from the manufacture of our products.  ClosetMaid’s wire shelving is manufactured from recycled steel.  Clopay’s garage doors feature energy saving insulation.  Across our facilities, we have installed energy efficient lighting systems that reduce our carbon footprint.  We divested our plastic film business that had the most environmentally controversial issues in connection with the disposal of the diapers and products that incorporated those films.
We are committed to the communities in which our facilities are located. To that end, we have invested in, expanded and continue to expand many of our facilities rather than outsource production. As a result we have created economically productive opportunities for employment for the residents of many of these communities. We also have a broad based employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") in which the vast majority (over 90%) of our U.S. full-time employees participate (at no cost to them), which aligns the economic interests of these employees with our shareholders and provides these employees with a meaningful ownership stake in our Company. As of September 30, 2019, the shares held in the ESOP represented approximately 12% of our outstanding common stock.
