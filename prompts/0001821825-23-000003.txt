Item 1. Business
Overview
Organon & Co. ("Organon" or the "Company") is a global health care company with a focus on improving the health of women throughout their lives. Organon develops and delivers innovative health solutions through a portfolio of prescription therapies and medical devices within women's health, biosimilars and established brands (the "Organon Products"). Organon has a portfolio of more than 60 medicines and products across a range of therapeutic areas. The Company sells these products through various channels including drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. The Company operates six manufacturing facilities, which are located in Belgium, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Unless otherwise indicated, trademarks appearing in italics throughout this document are trademarks of, or are used under license by, the Organon group of companies. 
The Company's operations include the following product portfolios:
•Women's Health: Organon's women's health products are sold by prescription primarily in two therapeutic areas, contraception, with key brands such as Nexplanon® (etonogestrel implant) (sold as Implanon NXT™ ¹ in some countries outside the United States) and NuvaRing® (estonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring), and fertility, with key brands such as Follistim® AQ (follitropin beta injection) and Elonva™ ¹ (corifollitropin alfa). Nexplanon, a long-acting reversible contraceptive, which is a class of contraceptives that is recognized as one of the most effective types of hormonal contraception available to patients with a low long-term average cost. The Jada® System is intended to provide control and treatment of abnormal postpartum uterine bleeding or hemorrhage when conservative management is warranted. Organon acquired Jada® through its acquisition of Alydia Health. Elonva is a sustained follicle stimulant for controlled ovarian stimulation in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone ("GnRH") antagonist for the development of multiple follicles in women participating in assisted reproductive technologies. It is not approved or marketed in the United States but is available and marketed in certain European countries. In addition, Organon has a license from Daré Biosciences for the global commercial rights to Xaciato™ (clindamycin phosphate vaginal gel, 2%), an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis ("BV") in females 12 years of age and older. Organon's mission is to be the world's leading women's health company and to deliver a better and healthier every day for every woman. Organon plans to continue building on its strengths in reproductive health and fertility as it assembles a suite of health options that help address the areas of high unmet needs for women from adolescence to menopause and beyond.
•Biosimilars: Organon's current portfolio spans across immunology and oncology treatments. Organon plans to continue evaluating opportunities in other potential therapeutic areas, including ophthalmology, diabetes and neuroscience. Organon's oncology biosimilars have been launched in more than 20 countries and Organon's immunology biosimilars have been launched in five countries. All five biosimilars in Organon's portfolio have launched in Canada, and two biosimilars, Ontruzant® (trastuzumab-dttb) and Renflexis® (infliximab-abda) have been launched in the United States. Organon expects to grow its existing portfolio through future launches in other therapeutic areas, both through Organon's partnership with its development partners, Samsung Bioepis and Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. ("Henlius"), and other potential partners. Organon's existing biosimilars portfolio positions the Company for success in this attractive and fast-growing area of health care with several major biologics that will lose patent protection in the next decade.
•Established Brands: Organon has a portfolio of established brands, which generally are beyond market exclusivity, including leading brands in cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatology and non-opioid pain management. A number of Organon's established brands lost exclusivity years ago and have faced generic competition for some time, yet still contribute meaningful profitability. Organon intends to stimulate the performance of its established brands products through renewed focus and attention on strategic marketing to create a significant source of capital to fuel its growth aspirations. Organon believes its established brands products will, over time, continue to deliver meaningful revenue and operating profit that can be redirected into organic and inorganic growth opportunities in key product areas and geographies. Organon's established brands portfolio is supported by its large commercial and manufacturing capabilities, including a global network that enables Organon to distribute products to patients in more than 140 countries and territories.
Led by the women's health portfolio coupled with an expanding biosimilars business and stable franchise of established medicines, Organon's products produce strong cash flows to support investments in innovation and future growth opportunities

in women's health. In addition, Organon is pursuing opportunities to collaborate with biopharmaceutical innovators looking to commercialize their products by leveraging its scale and presence in fast growing international markets.
Organon has expanded its women's health and biosimiliars portfolio through the following recent acquisitions and licenses:
•In January 2023, entered into a strategic investment with Claria Medical, Inc. ("Claria") a privately-held company developing an investigational medical device being studied for use during minimally invasive laparoscopic hysterectomy.
•In July 2022, entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Cirqle Biomedical ("Cirqle") for a novel investigational non-hormonal, on-demand contraceptive candidate.
•In June 2022, entered into a licensing agreement with Henlius, for commercialization rights for biosimilar candidates HLX11, referencing Perjeta² (pertuzumab), used for the treatment of certain patients with HER2+ breast cancer in combinations with trastuzumab and chemotherapy and HLX14, referencing Prolia²/Xgeva² (denosumab), used for the treatment of certain patients with osteoporosis with high risk of fracture and for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastasis from solid tumors. 
•In March 2022, entered into a licensing agreement with Daré for global commercial rights to Xaciato. Xaciato is an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis ("BV") in females 12 years of age and older. Xaciato received both Qualified Infectious Disease Product ("QIDP") and Fast Track designations from the FDA for the treatment of BV.
Spinoff from Merck
On June 2, 2021, Organon and Merck & Co. ("Merck") entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the "Separation and Distribution Agreement"). Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Merck agreed to spin off the Organon Products into Organon, a new, publicly traded company (the "spinoff"). As a result, Organon became a standalone publicly traded company and on June 3, 2021 regular-way trading of Organon's Common Stock (the "Common Stock") commenced on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "OGN."
The spinoff was completed pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with Merck related to the spinoff including, but not limited to, a tax matters agreement (the "Tax Matters Agreement" or "TMA"), an employee matters agreement the ("Employee Matters Agreement") and a transition services agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement" or "TSA"). See Note 1 "Background and Nature of Operations" and Note 18 "Third-Party Arrangements and Related Party Disclosures" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional details.

The following highlights key products in our portfolios:

Women's Health | Biosimilars | Established Brands

Women's Health Portfolio
In 2022, Organon's women's health portfolio accounted for $1.7 billion, or approximately 27%, of Organon's revenues, with $774 million, or approximately 46%, generated outside the United States. Organon's women's health products are sold by prescription primarily in two therapeutic areas, contraception, with key brands such as Nexplanon and NuvaRing®, and fertility, with key brands such as Follistim AQ and Elonva. Additionally, Organon continues to assess commercialization opportunities in conditions unique to women or disproportionally affecting women, such as Jada acquired as a part of the acquisition of Alydia Health and the licensing agreement with Daré for global commercial rights to Xaciato. Organon's women's health products are sold in over 90 markets worldwide, including the United States, China, Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Mexico as well as many other countries in the European Union ("EU"), South America, Asia, and Africa.
Contraception
Organon's contraception portfolio currently consists of the following products, which work to prevent pregnancy primarily by suppressing ovulation:
Nexplanon is a prescription medication for the prevention of pregnancy in women lasting up to three years and is reversible upon removal. Nexplanon is a small, thin and flexible arm implant that is placed discreetly under the skin of the inner, upper non-dominant arm by a health care provider. It is a progestin-only, radiopaque, removable implant, containing 68 mg of etonogestrel pre-loaded into an applicator and is typically prescribed in women who are not looking to become pregnant in the near future and do not want to take a daily contraceptive.
NuvaRing is a monthly vaginal contraceptive ring with a combination of progestin and estrogen used to prevent pregnancy in women. NuvaRing typically is prescribed for women that want a monthly contraceptive option.
-5-


Cerazette™ ¹ (desogestrel) is a progestin-only, daily pill used to prevent pregnancy in women. Progestin-only products like Cerazette¹ are typically used by women wanting hormonal contraception for whom estrogen-containing contraceptives may not be medically appropriate. Cerazette¹ is not approved or marketed in the United States but is available in certain countries outside the United States.
Marvelon™ ¹ (desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol pill) and Mercilon™ ¹ (desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol pill) are both combinations of progestin and estrogen used as daily pills to prevent pregnancy. Marvelon contains a higher daily dose of estrogen than Mercilon. Marvelon and Mercilon are not approved or marketed in the United States but are available in certain countries outside the United States, including now in China and Vietnam as a result of a recent transaction with Bayer Healthcare where Organon gained rights to Marvelon and Mercilon in these markets. 
Fertility
Organon's fertility brands include the following products, which are primarily used for in vitro fertilization ("IVF") treatment cycles:
Follistim AQ, which is marketed as Puregon™ ¹ in most countries outside the United States, contains human follicle-stimulating hormone ("FSH") and is used to promote the development of multiple ovarian follicles in assisted reproduction technology procedures, such as IVF, embryo transfer, gamete intrafallopian transfer and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Follistim AQ belongs to the group of gonadotrophic hormones used by women trying to get pregnant using IVF.
Elonva is an ovarian follicle stimulant with the same mechanism of action as recombinant FSH, but characterized by a prolonged duration of FSH activity. Due to its ability to initiate and sustain growth of multiple ovarian follicles for an entire week, a single subcutaneous injection of the recommended dose of Elonva may replace the first seven injections of any daily recombinant FSH preparation in an ovarian stimulation treatment cycle. Elonva belongs to the group of gonadotrophic hormones used by women trying to get pregnant using IVF. 
Ganirelix Acetate Injection (marketed in certain countries outside the United States as Orgalutran™ ¹) is an injectable ("GnRH") antagonist. Ganirelix Acetate Injection is used in fertility treatments in combination with FSH. 
Postpartum Hemorrhage
Organon's postpartum hemorrhage portfolio currently consists of Jada, which Organon acquired as part of Organon's acquisition of Alydia Health in June 2021. Jada is intended to provide control and treatment of abnormal postpartum uterine bleeding or hemorrhage when conservative management is warranted. Jada uses a low-level vacuum to encourage the physiologic contraction of the uterus to control bleeding.
Jada was first cleared by the FDA for use in the United States in August of 2020. In September 2021, technological updates to Jada received clearance in the United States from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA"), and officially launched in February 2022.
Organon is seeking marketing authorization of Jada outside the United States with approvals in select markets starting in 2023.
Bacterial Vaginosis 
In March 2022, Organon entered into a license with Daré Bioscience for Xaciato. Xaciato is an FDA-approved medication for the treatment of BV in females 12 years of age and older. Xaciato received both QIDP and Fast Track designations from the FDA for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
Organon aims to launch Xaciato in the United States in the first half of 2023 and plans to assess opportunities and potentially seek further marketing authorizations for countries outside the United States.
Biosimilars Portfolio
In 2022, Organon's biosimilars portfolio accounted for $481 million, or approximately 8%, of revenues, with $237 million, or approximately 49%, generated outside the United States. The assets in Organon's biosimilars portfolio and Organon's commercial experience in biosimilars provides an opportunity to benefit from future growth anticipated in this area.

Internal Manufacturing Capabilities
Organon owns and operates six manufacturing sites, as shown in the table below, where it manufactures a range of pharmaceutical products, including hormonal products, sterile formulations, certain medical device combination and standalone medical device products.

Site | Predominant Area of Focus 
Campinas, Brazil | Women's health, cardiovascular and respiratory
Cramlington, UK | Cardiovascular and respiratory 
Heist, Belgium | Respiratory, dermatology and pain 
Oss, Netherlands | Women's health 
Pandaan, Indonesia | Cardiovascular, respiratory and dermatology 
Xochimilco, Mexico | Cardiovascular and respiratory 

A majority of Organon's internal manufacturing sites have long-standing, deep technical capabilities across the broad base of manufacturing platforms that are required to support Organon's product portfolio. Organon's specialized manufacturing capabilities include oral solid dosage manufacturing, liquids, ointments and creams manufacturing, aseptic processing of hormonal products, extrusion technology, inhaler and implant medical device combination products, standalone medical device products, and packaging to facilitate speed to market as well as more direct control of quality and compliance. Organon also continues to manufacture a range of Merck products at each of Organon's six manufacturing sites pursuant to agreements with Merck entered into at the time of the spinoff.
Global Supply Chain
Organon manages its global supply chain through a centralized supply planning organization and regional demand management, distribution and logistics teams structured around North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Organon's global commercial and manufacturing teams collaborate on various operational efficiency initiatives, including yield improvements, procurement savings, site synergies, manufacturing support rationalization and supply chain distribution optimization, each intended to improve Organon's leverage position.
Organon purchases certain raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, components, devices and other supplies necessary for the commercial production of its products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Organon utilizes third-party contract manufacturers for packaging, formulation and fill-and-finish for its products. Organon also utilizes a combination of logistics service providers as part of its global supply chain, primarily for storage and for shipping and delivering raw materials, intermediate goods and finished goods between internal sites and from production sites to customers.
In order to satisfy the manufacturing and regulatory requirements for the breadth of products in Organon's portfolio, a number of Organon's materials and components are sole-sourced. Certain of these sole-sourced materials are critical to Organon's key products, including women's health and legacy brands. Organon sources 100% of its active pharmaceutical ingredients externally and portions of its drug product. While the majority are single sourced, they are from established pharmaceutical suppliers with whom Organon has significant experience. In particular, Organon relies heavily on one supplier for formulation and/or packaging as Organon's gateway to sales in both Japan and China.
To mitigate supply risk, Organon aims to have a conservative inventory posture and to keep an internal function focused on maintaining an external manufacturing network with operational, quality, technology and procurement capabilities. This function is responsible for identifying, developing and assessing the performance of Organon's suppliers such that they meet quality expectations and satisfy their contractual obligations to Organon. In addition, this function provides rapid response support for potential supply issues. Organon also has an established risk management framework, which is intended to assess and mitigate risk elements across Organon's supply chain.
Organon's manufacturing network and supply chains are designed to provide it with a flexible and scalable global platform for continued expansion, including in emerging markets. Organon believes its extensive manufacturing and supply chain expertise and capabilities positions it well to provide critical therapies for distribution worldwide and to meet growing demand over the long-term.

Organon's quality management system is designed to promote and facilitate regulatory and operational excellence, anticipate risks, and prepare the network to effectively respond and adapt to emerging trends.
Human Capital
Organon's human resources organization is led by an experienced team that monitors its employee base and sets annual targets for managing its human capital, including employee retention, engagement, and training targets. The Talent Committee of Organon's Board regularly reviews and discusses with management Organon's diversity, inclusion and leadership development initiatives, objectives, and progress. 
Organon has established benefit and incentive compensation plans, including comprehensive medical and life insurance coverage, 401(k) matching programs and other incentive compensation programs that Organon believes align employee incentives directly with Organon's future performance.
As of December 31, 2022, Organon had approximately 10,000 employees worldwide with approximately 1,650 (16.5%) employees in the United States (including Puerto Rico). Approximately 86% of Organon's employees work in key functional areas (Commercial, Research & Development, and Manufacturing/Supply) and 14% are in support functions. Organon has approximately 3,850 employees worldwide focused on commercialization activities, such as marketing, direct selling, digital and omni-channel and insight generation, covering data stewardship, data analytics and data science, and approximately 900 employees are focused on clinical development, safety, and medical affairs and product registration. 
Organon strives to build a strong culture with inclusion and belonging at its core, believing that this is fundamental to success and future innovation. More than 30% of Organon's U.S. employees identify as part of an underrepresented ethnic group. Organon supports its workforce through innovative talent and performance programs and have additionally founded ten Employee Resource Groups. Organon also regularly assesses its employees' experience, including measures of engagement, well-being, inclusion, and core cultural values through annual surveys and regular check-ins.
Organon's employees are at the core of its mission to improve the health of women and, given Organon's global nature, it has a strong focus on female representation. Globally, over 50% of Organon's employees are female, and women comprise approximately 40% of Organon's senior leadership (nearly 70% of the Board of Directors; 40% Executive Committee). 
Intellectual Property
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
Patent protection is important to the marketing of certain of Organon's products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents may cover products per se, pharmaceutical formulations, processes for, or intermediates useful in, the manufacture of products, devices for delivering products, or the uses of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the legal life of patents in the various countries, and may be extended in some jurisdictions based upon the period of time a patented product is under regulatory review by the relevant health authority. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent and its scope of coverage.
In particular, Organon considers the patents that cover the rod technology in Nexplanon to be material to Organon's business. Such device patents will expire in 2027 in the United States and in 2025 in other countries around the world. There are currently no contested proceedings or third-party claims that involve these patents. Organon has been granted a license from Merck for Nexplanon / Implanon NXT that permits use of the underlying technology solely as a contraceptive implant containing only the active pharmaceutical ingredient currently used in the product. Additionally, in December 2021, Organon signed a supplemental license with Merck that provides a limited expansion of the fields in which it may use the underlying technology of Nexplanon / Implanon NXT beyond contraception in exchange for milestone payments. 
While the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered pharmaceutical product, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from: (i) later-granted patents on processes and intermediates related to the 
-12-


most economical method of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (ii) patents relating to the use or delivery of such product; (iii) patents relating to novel compositions and formulations; and (iv) in the United States and certain other countries, market or data exclusivity that may be available under relevant law. The effect of product patent expiration on pharmaceutical products also depends upon many other factors, such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in other countries.
Additions to market or data exclusivity are sought in the United States and other countries through all relevant laws, including laws increasing patent life. Some of the benefits of increases in patent life have been partially offset by an increase in the number of incentives for and use of generic products. Additionally, improvements in intellectual property laws are sought in the United States and other countries through reform of patent and other relevant laws and implementation of international treaties.
For further information with respect to Organon's patents, see the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and Note 12 "Contingencies—Patent Litigation" to the Financial Statements included in this report. 
Worldwide, all of Organon's important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used; in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely.
Royalty income in 2022 on patent and know-how licenses and other rights amounted to $3 million. Organon also incurred royalty expenses totaling $13 million in 2022 under patent and know-how licenses Organon holds.
Privacy and Data Protection
Organon is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, many of which place restrictions on Organon's ability to transfer, access and use personal data across its business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. There are privacy and data protection frameworks in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to directly affect Organon's business. These include, for instance, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which went into effect in May 2018 and imposes penalties of up to 4% of global revenue; China's Personal Information Protection Law ("PIPL"), which came into effect November 1, 2021; and U.S. state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective January 1, 2020, and has been amended and strengthened by the California Privacy Rights Act, which came into force January 1, 2023. Additional privacy and data protection laws will come into force in upcoming years, for instance, Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act, Colorado's Privacy Act, and United Arab Emirates' Protection of Personal Data Protection. These changing requirements could cause Organon to incur substantial costs or require it to change its business practices or compliance procedures in a manner adverse to Organon's business.
Competition and the Health Care Environment
Competition
The markets in which Organon conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry in general are highly competitive and highly regulated. Organon's competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers. Organon's operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as Organon's products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors' branded products and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. In addition, patent rights are increasingly being challenged by competitors and the outcome can be highly uncertain. An adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the payment of royalties or in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products. Competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown.
To remain competitive, the additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet buyer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service. Organon plans to acquire and market products through external alliances, such as licensing arrangements and collaborations, and has designed its sales and marketing efforts to address changing industry conditions. However, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents.

Health Care Environment
Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access.
Health Care Programs
The United States enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010 in the form of the Affordable Care Act (the "ACA"). The ACA, among other things, increased the mandated Medicaid drug rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid-managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. The ACA, together with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 70% (up from 50% from the ACA effective 2019) of the negotiated price of the medicine, including biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called "donut hole provision"). Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "IRA"), this coverage gap will be eliminated beginning January 1, 2025. The IRA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay 10% of the negotiated price of brands, biologics and biosimilar products, when Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the initial coverage phase, and 20% of the negotiated price in the catastrophic phase of Medicare Part D coverage. Organon's cost-sharing responsibility for any approved product covered by Medicare Part D could be significantly greater under the newly designed Part D benefit structure compared to the pre-IRA benefit design. Organon recorded approximately $16 million, $17 million and $24 million as a reduction to revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the coverage gap or "donut hole" provision. Furthermore, the IRA, among other reforms, allows Medicare to, beginning in 2026, establish a "maximum fair price" for certain high expenditure pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D. Organon's products could be selected for negotiation and become subject to prices representing a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. The IRA also allows Medicare to, beginning in 2023, penalize drug companies that raise prices for products covered under Medicare Parts B and D faster than inflation through establishing a rebate obligation for those companies. The IRA also imposes on manufacturers that fail to comply with certain provisions of the IRA penalties, including civil monetary penalties. 
In addition, certain pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay an annual non-tax deductible branded prescription drug fee. The total annual industry fee was $2.8 billion in the years 2020 through 2022. The fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
Organon recorded approximately $3 million, $10 million and $4 million of costs within selling, general and administrative expenses in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. In February 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued the Medicaid Drug Rebate Final Rule, which provided comprehensive guidance on the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price ("AMP") and Best Price—two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state Medicaid programs. Under this Final Rule, CMS requires manufacturers to include sales to the U.S. Territories in the calculation of AMP and Best Price; however, that provision was delayed several times and took effect on January 1, 2023. 
On December 31, 2020, CMS published a Final Rule on the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which, among other things, introduced for the first time a regulatory definition of the terms "line extension" and "new formulation." CMS defined "line extension" as ''a new formulation of the drug, but does not include an abuse-deterrent formulation of the drug[.]" CMS adopted an expansive definition of "new formulation" to include ''a change to the drug, including, but not limited to: an extended release formulation or other change in release mechanism, a change in dosage form, strength, route of administration, or ingredients." This expanded definition may result in certain of Organon's drugs being subject to a higher Medicaid rebate liability. The new definitions of "line extension" and "new formulation" took effect on January 1, 2022. Finally, the provisions of this December 2020 Final Rule also may affect rebates owed under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program in certain circumstances where accumulator adjustment or similar programs are applied to Organon's drugs and the value of Organon's assistance programs, which is intended for patients, is not counted towards the patient's deductible or other out-of-pocket costs.
In addition, other legislative changes include automatic 2% aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers, which results in an overall reduction in physician-administered drug reimbursement from 106% of Average Sales Price ("ASP") to approximately 104.3% of ASP. This change is part of the federal budget sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, which went into effect in April 2013. The sequestration was temporarily halted from May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022 as a result of various legislation, and later reduced to 1% from April 2022 to June 2022. The temporary suspension of the 2% reduction in Medicare payments to providers that was instituted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic expired on July 1, 2022, with the 2% reduction set to remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Organon cannot predict how these and future adjustments to sequestration, and the way in which these laws impact physician reimbursement for Organon's products, will affect Organon's profitability.
-14-


Drug Pricing
Organon also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect Organon's sales and profit margins, including, in the United States (i) practices of managed care organizations, federal and state exchanges and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the ACA. For example, in November 2020, the OIG issued a Final Rule that would have, effective January 1, 2022, eliminated the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for rebates paid to Medicare Part D plans or to pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs") on behalf of such plans. The effectiveness of this Final Rule was delayed as part of the IRA, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022 and requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services not to implement, administer, or enforce the provisions of the Final Rule prior to January 1, 2032. As a result, it remains to be seen whether, and to what extent, the provisions of this Final Rule will take effect. While Organon cannot anticipate the effects of these changes on the way Organon currently contracts, the new framework could significantly alter the way Organon does business with Part D Plan Sponsors and PBMs on behalf of such plans.
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the IRA into law, which sets forth meaningful changes to drug product reimbursements by Medicare, which may reduce the prices Organon can charge and reimbursement Organon can receive for its products, among other effects.
On October 14, 2022, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans which instructed the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to consider whether to select for testing by the CMS Innovation Center new health care payment and delivery models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Executive Order further directed the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to submit, within 90 days after the date of the Executive Order, a report regarding any models that may lead to lower cost-sharing for commonly used drugs and support value-based payment that promotes high-quality care. 
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing. Specifically, several U.S. states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports, and/or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities. Other state laws prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers, and restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. In addition, several recently passed state laws require disclosures related to state agencies and/or commercial purchasers with respect to certain price increases that exceed a certain level as identified in the relevant statutes. Some of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements that government officials have not yet clarified. Given the lack of clarity in the laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
In 2020, the FDA issued a final rule implementing provisions of Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"), which allows the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada through FDA-authorized, time-limited programs sponsored by states or Indian tribes and, in certain future circumstances, pharmacists and wholesalers. At that time, the FDA also released a final guidance for industry detailing procedures for drug manufacturers to import FDA-approved prescription drug, biological, and combination products (approved under a New Drug Application ("NDA") or Biologics License Application ("BLA")) that were manufactured abroad and authorized and originally intended for sale in a foreign country. A trade organization brought suit, which remains pending in federal district court, challenging the commercial importation final rule. These changes could have a material adverse effect on Organon's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. 
In the United States private sector, consolidation and integration among health care providers is a major factor in the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical products. Health plans and PBMs have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Organon's products or obtaining such placement at unfavorable pricing could adversely affect revenue. In addition to formulary tier co-pay or co-insurance differentials, private health insurance companies and self-insured employers have been raising co-payments and co-insurance required from beneficiaries, particularly for branded pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products. Private health insurance companies are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. These same management tools are also used in treatment areas in which the payor has taken the position that multiple branded 
-15-


products are therapeutically comparable. As the United States payor market concentrates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, pharmaceutical companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payors. In addition, other proposals that allow international reference pricing or, under certain conditions, the importation of medicines from other countries may be considered. 
European Union
Pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is not harmonized at the EU level, but rather controlled by individual EU Member States. In addition, a majority of countries in the EU attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs. Reference pricing may either compare a product's prices in other markets (external reference pricing) or compare a product's price with those of other products in a national class (internal reference pricing). The authorities then use the price data to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including Organon's. Guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations. Some EU Member States have established free-pricing systems, but regulate the pricing for drugs through profit control plans. Others seek to negotiate or set prices based on the cost-effectiveness of a product or an assessment of whether it offers a therapeutic benefit over other products in the relevant class. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In some EU Member States, cross-border imports from low-priced markets also exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within an EU Member State.
Additionally, EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement. In the EU, reimbursement plans vary widely from EU Member State to EU Member State. Some EU Member States provide that drug products may be marketed only after agreement on a reimbursement price. Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to already available therapies, or so-called health technology assessments ("HTA"), to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. The HTA of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in most EU Member States. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, involves the assessment of the cost-effectiveness, public health impact, therapeutic impact and/or the economic and social impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national health care system of the individual country. Ultimately, HTA measures the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones. The outcome of HTAs regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of Organon's products may mean that the product is not reimbursable or may force Organon to reduce Organon's reimbursement price or offer discounts or rebates. A negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body could also undermine Organon's ability to obtain reimbursement for the relevant product outside a jurisdiction. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms may rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework to inform pricing and reimbursement decisions. HTA procedures require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.
To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some EU Member States, Organon may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of Organon's product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any EU Member State will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of Organon's products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.
Brexit
In 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as "Brexit." As a result of that referendum and subsequent negotiations, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. A transitional period existed until December 31, 2020, and during this period the EU and the UK operated as if the UK was an EU Member State, and the UK continued to participate in the EU Customs Union allowing for the freedom of movement for people and goods. Since January 1, 2021, the UK has been treated as a third country (i.e., not part of the EU single market or Customs Union) and is no longer bound by any EU laws (although the UK retained existing EU legislation in its national legislation). However, the Northern Irish Protocol currently provides that certain EU laws have effect in Northern Ireland and that Northern Ireland is within the EU single market.
On December 24, 2020, the EU and the UK agreed to a Trade and Cooperation Agreement ("TCA"). The TCA sets out the new arrangements for trade of goods, including medicines and vaccines, which allows goods to continue to flow between the EU and the UK. The TCA provisionally applied from January 1, 2021 and was permanently in force from May 1, 2021. As a result of the TCA, Organon believes its operations will not be materially adversely affected by Brexit.

Japan
In Japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products. Furthermore, the government can order re-pricings for specific products if it determines that use of such products will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules. 
China
Organon's business in China has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of China to Organon's overall pharmaceutical business has increased accordingly. Continued growth of Organon's business in China is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products, sustained access for Organon's current in-line products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced and implemented several structural reforms to accelerate the shift to innovative products and reduce costs. Since 2017, there have been multiple new policies introduced by the Chinese government to improve access to innovation, reduce the complexity of regulatory filings, and accelerate the review and approval process. This has led to a significant increase in the number of new products being approved each year. Additionally, in 2017, the Chinese government updated the National Reimbursement Drug List ("NRDL") for the first time in eight years. Since 2017, NRDL is being executed on an annual basis, which creates an access platform for innovative products. Though at the same time this regular innovative products access has been coupled with significant price reductions to ensure public access to NRDL and periodical-biannual price reviews for NRDL products. 
While pricing pressure has always existed in China, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through volume-based procurement ("VBP"). In 2019, the government implemented the VBP program through a tendering process for mature products that have generic substitutes with a Generic Quality Consistency Evaluation ("GQCE") approval. Mature products that have entered into the first seven rounds of VBP have had, on average, a price reduction of approximately 50%. Organon expects VBP to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward, which Organon expects to increase pricing pressure on its products in China. There are 300 molecules currently included under VBP, and it is expected that an aggregate of 500 molecules will be subject to VBP by 2025.
Other Markets
Organon's focus on other markets has continued. Governments in many other markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and measures impacting intellectual property, including in exceptional cases, threats of compulsory licenses that aim to put pressure on the price of innovative pharmaceuticals or result in constrained market access to innovative medicine. Organon anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in the future to varying degrees in such markets.
Beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in certain countries outside the United States can affect Organon's efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, changes in trade sanctions and embargoes, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, credit worthiness of health care partners such as hospitals due to COVID-19, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for Organon. Further, Organon may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in such markets, which may affect Organon's ability to realize continued growth and may also increase Organon's risk exposure.
In addressing cost containment pressures, Organon engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. Organon advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, Organon encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms to improve their citizens' access to appropriate health care, including medicines.
Regulation of Organon's Products
The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world, focused on standards and processes for determining drug and device safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement.
-17-


Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In some cases, the FDA requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the United States. At the same time, the FDA has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the ''breakthrough therapy" designation, and established other expedited programs to support the development, review, and approval of medicines where there is unmet medical need in serious and life-threatening conditions. The FDA has also undertaken efforts to bring generic and biosimilar competition to market more efficiently and in a timelier manner.
The EU has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, approval for marketing, labeling, advertising, manufacturing, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring of medicinal products for human use. These provide mandatory standards throughout the EU, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the EU Member States. In particular, EU regulators may approve products subject to several post-authorization conditions. Examples of typical post-authorization commitments include additional pharmacovigilance, the conduct of clinical trials, the establishment of patient registries, physician or patient education and controlled distribution and prescribing arrangements. Non-compliance with post-authorization conditions, pharmacovigilance and other obligations can lead to regulatory action, including the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations, or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including the imposition of financial penalties. Organon's policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, Organon believes that they will not have any material effect on Organon's business.
Organon believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs and devices, in this regulatory environment.
FDA Regulation
Drugs and Biologics
Industry practice and government regulations in the United States and most foreign countries provide for the determination of effectiveness and safety of new chemical compounds suitable for pharmaceutical use through pre-clinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. Before a new drug may be marketed in the United States, recorded data on pre-clinical and clinical investigations are included in the NDA for a drug or the Biologics License Application ("BLA") for a biologic, and submitted to the FDA for the required approval.
Once scientists identify internal technology development opportunities or external technology licensing opportunities to enable improvement of existing products or development of new products, pre-clinical testing with that compound is commenced. Pre-clinical testing includes laboratory testing and safety studies in animals to gather data on chemistry, pharmacology, immunogenicity, and toxicology, and must be conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice regulations. Pending acceptable pre-clinical data, Organon will submit an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application to the FDA through a combination of internal and external resources, which includes the results of pre-clinical testing, information about the drug composition and manufacturing, and Organon's plan for clinical testing on humans. After submission of the IND, Organon must wait 30 days before initiating clinical testing so that the FDA can review the IND and determine that clinical testing will not expose human subjects to unreasonable risk. The FDA may impose a full or partial hold on an IND before or after it goes into effect, requiring that Organon halt clinical testing in accordance with the hold. Once an IND goes into effect, Organon will then initiate clinical testing under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with established regulatory requirements, including Good Clinical Practice regulations. The clinical testing typically begins with Phase 1 studies, which are designed to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary pharmacodynamic activity of the compound in humans. If favorable, additional, larger Phase 2 studies are initiated to determine evidence of the efficacy of the compound in the affected population and define appropriate dosing for the compound, as well as identify any adverse effects that could limit the compound's usefulness. In some situations, the clinical program incorporates adaptive design methodology to use accumulating data to decide how to modify aspects of the ongoing clinical study as it continues without undermining the validity and integrity of the trial. One type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2a / 2b trial design, a two-stage trial design consisting of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept stage and a Phase 2b dose-optimization finding stage. If data from the Phase 2 trials are satisfactory, Organon commences large-scale Phase 3 trials to confirm the compound's efficacy and safety. Another type of adaptive clinical trial is an adaptive Phase 2 / 3 trial design, a study that can include an interim analysis and an adaptation that changes the trial from having features common in a Phase 2 study (such as multiple dose groups) to a design similar to a Phase 3 trial. An adaptive Phase 2 / 3 trial design can reduce timelines by eliminating activities which would be required to start a separate study. Upon completion of Phase 3 trials, if satisfactory, Organon submits regulatory filings with the appropriate regulatory agencies around the world to have the product candidate approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that a compound that is the result of any particular program will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for it to be marketed. After a product receives 
-18-


marketing authorization, the FDA may require Organon to perform post-marketing studies, or Phase 4 studies, which may involve additional clinical trials, nonclinical testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products or to provide additional information regarding treatment or a drug's risks, benefits, or best use.
In the United States, upon completion of clinical testing, a complete NDA or BLA is submitted to the FDA. Within 60 days after receipt, the FDA determines if the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, or instead if the FDA will issue a refuse to file determination. The FDA also assesses, at that time, whether the application will be granted a priority review or standard review. Pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA review period target for NDAs or original BLAs is either six months for priority review or 10 months for a standard review from the time the application is deemed sufficiently complete. An additional two months is added to these timelines for new molecular entities. Once the review timelines are determined, the FDA will generally act upon the application within those timelines, unless a major amendment has been submitted (either at Organon's own initiative or the FDA's request) to the pending application. If this occurs, the FDA may extend the review period to allow for review of the new information, but by no more than three months. These timelines are not binding, and the FDA may not meet them in particular cases. The FDA can act on an application either by issuing an approval letter or by issuing a Complete Response Letter ("CRL") stating that the application will not be approved in its present form and describing all deficiencies that the FDA has identified. Should Organon wish to pursue an application after receiving a CRL, absent an appeal, Organon is able to resubmit the application with information that addresses the questions or issues identified by the FDA to support approval. Resubmissions are subject to review period targets, which vary depending on the underlying submission type and the content of the resubmission.
The FDA has four primary program designations—Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review—to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA reviewers during the product's development and the ability for the manufacturer to do a rolling submission of the NDA/BLA. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis. The Breakthrough Therapy designation provides manufacturers with the same features of the Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced staff in the review. The Accelerated Approval designation allows the FDA to approve a product based on an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a product's clinical benefit and generally requires the manufacturer to conduct required post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA will require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform Phase 4 or post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted clinical benefit, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. The Priority Review designation means that the FDA's goal is to take action on the NDA/BLA within six months compared to 10 months under standard review, with two months added to these periods for new molecular entities. 
In addition, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act provides for an abbreviated pathway for obtaining FDA approval of biologic drugs that satisfy certain criteria. If a manufacturer can show that its proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to and has no clinically meaningful differences from the FDA-approved reference product, it can rely in part on the FDA's previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for obtaining approval. This can potentially lead to a faster and less costly approval process for these products because it generally means that the biosimilar manufacturer does not need to conduct as many clinical trials.
After the NDA or BLA has been approved, a drug can be marketed in the United States and remains subject to post-marketing drug safety monitoring requirements. Any significant changes to an approved drug, such as changes in formulation, labeling, dosage strength, or certain manufacturing changes, require approval by the FDA through a supplemental application, and for certain significant categories of changes, prior approval by the FDA. Additionally, further development of an approved drug for a new use, dosage strength, or a new or different form must be conducted under a new IND. Organon's activities after approval are subject to the FDA's requirements governing, among other things, drug establishment registration and listing, labeling and advertising, and current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") regulations, which set forth minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packing of a drug product. Post-approval reports of product quality defects and adverse events are maintained and submitted to the FDA in accordance with its regulations. The FDA conducts routine inspections of drug manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with these requirements. Non-compliance with cGMP or other regulatory requirements can lead to regulatory action, including issuance of Warning Letters to Organon or issuance of safety alerts, press releases, or other communications containing warnings about the products; suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorizations; suspension of any ongoing clinical trials; or other enforcement or regulatory actions, including seeking injunction or imposing civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines.

The FDA regulates the advertising and promotion of Organon's products to ensure that the claims Organon makes are consistent with its regulatory approvals, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims, and that Organon's promotional labeling and advertising are neither false nor misleading in any respect.
As a manufacturer and distributor of drug products, Organon's activities are regulated under various federal and state statutes, including the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (the "DQSA") and state manufacturer and wholesaler laws.
Title II of the DQSA, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, calls for the establishment of a nationwide electronic system that tracks certain prescription drugs at each point in the supply chain to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, or mislabeled drugs into the market. Implementation began in 2015 and is scheduled to be completed by late 2023. The FDA has issued regulations and guidance implementing the DQSA, which require manufacturers, distributors, and dispensers to comply with various regulatory requirements related to product identification, product tracing, product verification, detection and response, notification, and wholesaler licensing.
Under the Controlled Substances Act (the "CSA"), manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances must maintain registration with the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA"), and comply with various regulatory requirements, including maintaining records and inventory, reporting to the DEA, and meeting certain security and operational safeguards. Similar requirements exist in most states.
Medical Devices
The FDA's laws and regulations that govern medical devices include requirements for the design, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, clinical trials, and pre-market clearance and approval, among other requirements. Medical devices are classified into three classes based on their risk: Class I devices present the least risk; Class II devices present moderate risk; and Class III devices are the highest risk. The regulatory controls and requirements vary by the class of device. All classes of devices are subject to "general controls," which include: establishment registration and device listing, compliance with the design controls and good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System Regulation, medical device reporting, reporting of recalls, corrections and removals, and labeling and promotional requirements. Most Class I devices do not require any review by the FDA prior to marketing. Most Class II devices require the submission of a pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FDCA prior to marketing. Class II devices are also subject to "special controls," which are unique controls the FDA establishes for each device type, typically in the form of a guidance document that specifies requirements such as performance testing and labeling. Class III devices require FDA approval of a pre-market approval application ("PMA") prior to marketing and are subject to conditions of approval (which may include post-market study requirements or restrictions on the sale and distribution of the device). Devices that have not previously been classified are automatically Class III. However, if the device is low- or moderate-risk, the manufacturer can submit a de novo classification request asking the FDA to classify the device into Class I or Class II and authorize the marketing of the device. 
A 510(k) pre-market notification must demonstrate that the proposed device is "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device already on the market. Substantial equivalence means that the proposed device: (1) has the same intended use as the predicate device; and (2) either (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, but does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device and data demonstrate the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is not "substantially equivalent" to a previously cleared device, or if the FDA has not classified the device, the device is automatically a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a classification into Class I or II via a de novo classification request. A de novo classification request must describe the risks and benefits of the device and demonstrate that general controls (for a Class I device) or general and special controls (for a Class II device) provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data.
Clinical trials are almost always required to support PMAs and are sometimes required to support 510(k) pre-market notifications. Such clinical testing must be conducted in compliance with the FDA's investigational device exemption ("IDE") regulations and additional regulations pertaining to human research. If the device is a "significant risk" device, clinical trial sponsors must obtain the FDA's approval of an IDE application prior to commencing the study. IDE approval is not required for non-significant risk device studies. All device clinical trials are subject to additional requirements, including obtaining informed consent from study subjects and approval by institutional review boards, monitoring, record-keeping, reporting and submitting information regarding certain clinical trials to a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
-20-


Once a device has obtained FDA clearance or approval, certain modifications will require further pre-market review before they can be implemented. For 510(k)-cleared devices (or Class II devices authorized through the de novo classification pathway), any change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device or that involves a major change to the device's intended use requires clearance of a new 510(k) pre-market notification. Manufacturers are responsible for determining whether a modification meets this standard, and for any changes the company determines do not require a 510(k), the rationale and information supporting the determination must be documented. For PMA approved devices, major changes (i.e., those affecting safety or effectiveness) require FDA approval of a PMA supplement. Certain other changes, including some labelling changes and some manufacturing changes, may be implemented with prior notice to the FDA. Other changes may be reported in periodic reports.
Marketed devices are also subject to ongoing FDA regulation. Requirements include those related to establishment registration and device listing, labeling and advertising, unique device identification, and good manufacturing practice and design controls. Device manufacturers are also subject to the FDA's medical device reporting regulations, which require a manufacturer to report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur. Manufacturer's must also comply with FDA's correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA corrections or removals undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA conducts routine inspections of device manufacturing facilities to monitor compliance with these requirements. Non-compliance can lead to informal or formal enforcement action, including Untitled Letters, Warning Letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, recalls, detention or seizure of Organon's products, import refusals, and criminal prosecution.
Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, Organon may not promote its products for such "off-label" uses and can only market its products for cleared or approved uses. Both the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission have authority over aspects of medical device promotion and prohibit false or misleading labeling and advertising. Other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities can also take action under other laws and regulations, such as false claims laws, if they consider Organon's business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs.
The Regulatory Approval Process Outside the United States
Before Organon's pharmaceutical products can be marketed outside the United States, they may be subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with health care professionals, pricing and reimbursement, may vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product, which would make launch of such products commercially unfeasible in such countries. There are also regulations setting out requirements for medical devices in jurisdictions outside the United States. These regulations set out requirements for placing devices on the market, investigations/trials, safety reporting, marketing and promotion.
The European Union
The following section sets out an overview of the regulatory framework for medicinal products and medical devices in the EU. These rules also apply in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), namely Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.
Drug and Biologic Development Process
Like the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC ("Clinical Trials Directive") sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework by setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, 
-21-


EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Clinical Trials Directive in a manner that is not always uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. Therefore, the EU has adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 ("Clinical Trials Regulation") as of January 31, 2022. 
Under this new Clinical Trials Regulation, the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been simplified and streamlined. For example, the sponsor submits a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the clinical trials information system. As part of the application process, the sponsor proposes a reporting EU Member State, which coordinates the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting EU Member State consults and coordinates with the other concerned EU Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned EU Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State can in limited circumstances declare an "opt-out" from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database.
National laws, regulations, and the applicable Good Clinical Practice and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines on Good Clinical Practice ("GCP").
During the development of a pharmaceutical product, the EMA and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding for any future Marketing Authorization Application ("MAA") of the product concerned. In the EU, the Pediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 ("Pediatric Regulation") sets out the requirements for testing medicinal products in pediatric populations. In most EU Member States, companies are also required to have an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan before enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial.
Drug and Biologic Marketing Authorization Procedures
In the EU, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization ("MA"). MAs can be obtained through the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure, the decentralized procedure, or a national procedure (the latter is available only for pharmaceutical products sold in a single EU Member State only). The primary method Organon uses to obtain a MA of pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the centralized procedure.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission ("EC"), which is valid for all EU Member States (and, after respective national implementing decisions, in the three additional EEA Member States). The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, including pharmaceutical products derived from biotechnological processes, orphan pharmaceutical products, advanced therapy pharmaceutical products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. 
Under the centralized procedure, the timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA's CHMP is, in principle, 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, which occur when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more. Applications may be eligible for accelerated assessment if the CHMP decides the product is of major interest for public health and therapeutic innovation. On request, the CHMP can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment. The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements. However, the EC has final authority for granting the MA, and it must issue the decision within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion. 
Following the UK's exit from the EU on January 1, 2021, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") converted centralized MAs into UK MAs that apply in Great Britain (as under the Northern Irish Protocol the EU centralized MAs continue to apply in Northern Ireland). MA holders of the centralized MAs had the right to opt-out of the conversion until January 21, 2021; however, this would mean that these products would not be licensed to be marketed in Great Britain. For those with converted MAs, the holder of these MAs had to submit baseline data to the MHRA and pay the national 
-22-


MA fee. For EU MAs that were granted after January 1, 2021, these MAs will not be automatically converted into UK MAs. However, the MHRA offer some streamlined routes for authorization. For example, for three years from January 1, 2021 the MHRA may rely on the decision of the EC on the approval of a new centralized MA when granted an MA that applies in Great Britain.
If the centralized procedure is not used, then applicants can obtain national marketing authorizations. This can be if a pharmaceutical product falls under the optional scope of the centralized procedure and the applicant opts to use a national (decentralized / mutual recognition) procedure or if the centralized procedure would not apply. The purely national marketing authorization procedure permits a company to apply to the competent authority of a single EU Member State and, if successful, to obtain a MA that is valid only in this EU Member State. However, if the applicant wants a MA in several EU Member States it must use the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure (as applicable) to obtain a suite of national MAs.
The decentralized marketing authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for an MA to the competent authorities in several EU Member States simultaneously for a pharmaceutical product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. This procedure is available for pharmaceutical products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, the reference EU Member State, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned EU Member States, are subsequently required to grant MA for their territories based on this assessment. The only exception to this is where the competent authority of an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances the matter is submitted to the Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures - Human for review.
Where a pharmaceutical product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU Member State, this national authorization can be recognized in another EU Member State through the mutual recognition procedure. The EU Member State that has already granted a MA is the reference EU Member State. The holder of the MA then asks the reference EU Member State to either prepare or update an assessment report. As with the decentralized procedure, the assessment report is shared with the concerned EU Member States. These EU Member States must grant the MA unless the exception (on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health) applies.
Similar to accelerated approval regulations in the United States, conditional MAs can be granted in the EU by the EC in exceptional circumstances. A conditional MA can be granted for pharmaceutical products where, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product have not been supplied, a number of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the benefit / risk balance of the product is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data post-authorization, (iii) an unmet medical need will be fulfilled by the grant of the marketing authorization and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the pharmaceutical product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional MA must be renewed annually until it is eventually converted into a standard MA when the holder fulfills any obligations imposed and the data supports that the benefits outweigh its risks.
Alternatively, where the applicant can show it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions (because the condition is too rare, it would be impossible given the current state of scientific knowledge and/or it would be contrary to medical ethics), the EC may grant an MA in exceptional circumstances. MAs granted under exceptional circumstances will be reviewed annually to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. However, they will usually not result in a normal MA as the data to support its granting will never be generated.
All new MAAs must include a Risk Management Plan ("RMP") describing the risk management system that Organon will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. RMPs and Periodic Safety Update Reports ("PSURs") are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
Normal MAs (i.e., not including Conditional MAs and those granted under exceptional circumstances) have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
-23-


Data and Market Exclusivity for Drugs and Biologics
As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and / or data exclusivity in the EU that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor's generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (in the case of marketing exclusivity, even if the pharmaceutical product has already received an MA) and for data exclusivity, prohibiting another applicant from relying on the MA holder's pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another MA for the purposes of submitting an application. New medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a standalone application (i.e., on the basis of a dossier containing a complete suite of pre-clinical tests and clinical trials) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity. An additional noncumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. This product is referred to as the "reference medicinal product."
The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the reference medicinal product's first MA in the EU. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the data in the reference medicinal product's dossier. However, a generic product cannot launch until two (or three, if the reference medicinal product was authorized for an additional indication) years later (or a total of 10 or 11 years after the first MA in the EU of the reference medicinal product).
Another noncumulative one-year period of data exclusivity can be obtained where an application is made for a new indication for a well-established substance, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication. One year of data exclusivity is also available for data generated where a change of classification (i.e., from prescription-only to over the counter) of a pharmaceutical product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-trial tests or clinical trials. However, this data exclusivity only protects the new switch data (i.e., when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classification of the same substance, a competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year). 
However, data and market exclusivity are not monopoly rights. Therefore, another company could also market another version of the pharmaceutical product if such company can complete a full MAA with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials (without relying on the other initial applicant's data) and obtain MA of its product.
Post-Approval Regulation of Drugs and Biologics
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the EC and / or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licenses and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU good manufacturing practices rules, manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of pharmaceutical products.
Failure by Organon or by any of its third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors, to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or other applicable regulatory requirements, may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
The holder of an MA for a pharmaceutical product in the EU must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of pharmaceutical products. These pharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of MAs the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed pharmaceutical products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine's safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures, which may be time consuming, expensive and could impact Organon's profitability. MA holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. The EMA reviews PSURs for pharmaceutical products authorized through the centralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it 
-24-


can adopt an opinion advising that the existing MA for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The agency can advise that the MA holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies. The EMA opinion is submitted to the EC for its consideration. If the European Commission agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing MA. Failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligations in the EC's decision can undermine the on-going validity of the MA.
More generally, noncompliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the MA for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products in the EU is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive (EU) 2017/1572, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP"). Organon and its third-party manufacturers are also subject to other good manufacturing practices, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the EMA, the EC, the national competent authorities of EU Member States and other regulatory authorities. Companies may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions if they fail to comply with these practices. These include suspension of manufacturing authorization in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States' requirements governing the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products.
Compliance with EU GMP standards is required when manufacturing pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with GMP before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the EU or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with GMP. Similarly, the distribution of pharmaceutical products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States.
Sales and Marketing Regulation of Drugs and Biologics 
The advertising and promotion of Organon's products is also subject to EU laws, national laws of individual EU Member States and industry self-regulatory codes of conduct concerning promotion of pharmaceutical products, interactions with health care providers, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices.
While the laws in individual EU Member States might vary somewhat, in all EU Member States these laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to pharmaceutical products comply with the product's Summary of Product Characteristics ("SmPC") as approved by the competent regulatory authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to health care providers concerning the safe and effective use of the pharmaceutical product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the pharmaceutical product. Promotion of a pharmaceutical product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. The off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only pharmaceutical products. Enforcement is done on a national basis, in accordance with national rules/codes and is largely on the basis of self-regulation. Penalties for violations of the rules governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products vary between EU Member States but could include public censure, administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws/codes may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of Organon's products to the general public and may also impose limitations on its promotional activities with health care professionals.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and health care providers are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and health care providers' codes of professional conduct both at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States. Across the EU, the provision of benefits or advantages to health care providers to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the European Union. However, the provision of benefits or advantages to health care providers is also 
-25-


governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
While many EU Member States permit companies to make payments to health care providers in some circumstances, e.g., when they are used as consultants, certain EU Member States required that such payments must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with health care providers must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician's employer, his / her regulatory professional organization, and / or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct applicable in the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Medical Device Regulation
In the EU, medical devices are regulated by the European Union Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 ("MDR"), which became applicable on May 26, 2021. The MDR and its associated guidance document and harmonize standards and govern, among other things, device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical or performance testing, pre-market conformity assessment, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, claims, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance, vigilance, and market surveillance.
Before a device can be placed on the market in the EU, compliance with the MDR requirements must be demonstrated to affix the Conformité Européene mark ("CE Mark") to the product. To demonstrate compliance with these requirements, a conformity assessment procedure is required, conducted either by the manufacturer (for low risk medical devices only, which are known as Class I devices) or by an organization designated by an EU Member State to conduct conformity assessments known as a Notified Body (for higher risk medical devices, including Class I devices that are sterile and/or have a measuring function, Class IIa, Class IIb and Class III devices). The Notified Body issues a certificate of conformity, which entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE Mark to its devices after having prepared and signed a related EU Declaration of Conformity. 
Clinical evidence is required for most medium and high risk devices. In some cases, a clinical study may be required to support a CE marking application. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the clinical investigation requirements of the MDR, EU Member State requirements, and current good clinical practices defined in harmonized standards and guidance documents. 
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. For CE marked devices, certain modifications to the device or quality system depending on the conformity assessment procedure used must be submitted to and approved by the Notified Body before placing the modified device on the market.
Advertising and promotion of devices is governed by the MDR alongside national laws and guidance and is enforced on a country-by-country basis by National Competent Authorities. The MDR provides that devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are CE marked. National rules and enforcement environments may vary.
Economic Operators, including device manufacturers, must register their establishments and devices in the European data base on medical devices (EUDAMED) database once available. Device manufacturers are also subject to MDR vigilance requirements, which require that a manufacturer report to the relevant Competent Authorities any serious incident involving devices made available on the market and any field safety corrective action in respect of devices made available on the market or undertaken in a third country in relation to a device made available on the market.
Post-Brexit the MDR does not apply in the UK (apart from Northern Ireland, which under the Northern Irish Protocol is bound by certain EU laws). The medical device legislative framework in the UK is set out in the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. The Medical Devices Regulations 2002 replace the CE mark with a UKCA marking (although EU CE marks will be recognized until at least June 30, 2023), require manufacturers outside the UK to appoint a "UK Responsible Person" if they place devices on the Great British market and more wide-ranging device registration requirements.

Food and Drug Administration in South Korea and Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia. Each country has a separate and independent review process and timeline. In many markets, approval times can be longer as the regulatory authority requires approval in a major market, such as the United States or the EU and issuance of a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product from that market before initiating their local review process.
Climate and Environmental Matters
Organon believes that climate change could present risks to its business. Some of the potential effects of climate change to Organon's business could include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, changes in supply due to regulatory requirements, physical risks to Organon's facilities, water limitations and disruptions to Organon's supply chain. Some potential risks are integrated into Organon's business planning, including investment in reducing energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. Organon does not believe these potential risks are material to its business at this time.
Organon is not aware of any compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on Organon's business. Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities are estimated to be approximately $16 million in the aggregate for the years 2023 through 2027.

Third-Party Agreements
Samsung Bioepis Development and Commercialization Agreement
On February 18, 2013, Merck entered into a development and commercialization agreement with Samsung Bioepis (as subsequently amended, the "Samsung Bioepis Agreement"). All of the rights and obligations of Merck under the Samsung Bioepis Agreement were transferred to Organon in connection with the spinoff. The Samsung Bioepis Agreement grants Organon an exclusive license to commercialize the following pre-specified biosimilars products (with reference products in parenthesis) developed by Samsung Bioepis: adalimumab (Humira), bevacizumab (Avastin), infliximab (Remicade), trastuzumab (Herceptin) and etanercept (Enbrel). See "Business—Organon's Biosimilars Products" for a description of each product and the geographic areas in which Organon has an exclusive license for commercialization activities.
Under the Samsung Bioepis Agreement, Samsung Bioepis is responsible for pre-clinical and clinical development, process development and manufacturing, clinical trials and registration of product candidates. Organon's access rights to each product under the Samsung Bioepis Agreement last for ten years from each such product's launch date on a market-by-market basis. Unless the parties agree to extend the term, the agreement expires upon the expiration of the last such ten-year period. Organon may terminate the agreement with respect to a particular region or product if a product fails to meet certain milestones in such region. Organon may terminate the agreement upon 60 days' written notice to Samsung Bioepis for a particular presentation of a product in a region if Samsung Bioepis's revenue share for such product presentation in such region exceeds a certain contractual threshold. Organon may also terminate the agreement upon 60 days' written notice in the event of a third-party infringement claim that Samsung Bioepis decides to litigate despite Organon's opposition to such litigation.
The Samsung Bioepis Agreement may be terminated by either party on 30 days' written notice for a particular product or region if the parties fail to agree upon a strategy regarding third-party patents within six months following written notice by either party of the existence of such patents. The agreement may also be terminated by either party upon written notice if the other party commits a material breach of its obligations by specified actions within its reasonable control and has not cured such breach within 90 calendar days after notice requesting cure of the breach.
The Samsung Bioepis Agreement provides that gross profits are shared equally in all markets except for certain markets in Brazil where gross profits are shared 65% to Samsung Bioepis and 35% to Organon. The Samsung Bioepis Agreement also provides for payment of certain milestone license fees associated with pre-specified clinical and regulatory milestones to Samsung Bioepis, payment of the supply price for each product to Samsung Bioepis, and an upfront payment to Samsung Bioepis that was completed by Merck at the commencement of the agreement. As of December 31, 2022, there were $25 million in potential future regulatory milestone payments remaining under the agreement. For further information related to the Samsung Bioepis collaboration, see Note 4 "Samsung Collaboration" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report and the Samsung Bioepis Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to this report.
