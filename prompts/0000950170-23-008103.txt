BUSINESS
 Our Company
 Emerald is a leading operator of business-to-business (“B2B”) trade shows in the United States. Leveraging our shows as key market-driven platforms, we integrate live events, media content, industry insights, digital tools, data-focused solutions and e-commerce platforms into three complementary business lines – Connections, Content and Commerce. We have been recognized with many awards and accolades that reflect our industry leadership as well as the importance of our shows to the exhibitors and attendees we serve.
 Connections: Our trade show franchises typically hold market-leading positions within their respective industry verticals, with significant brand value established over a long period of time. Each of our shows is typically held at least annually, with certain franchises offering multiple editions per year. Our shows are frequently the preeminent event, drawing the highest attendance in their respective industry verticals. As a result, we are able to attract high-quality attendees, including those who have the authority to make purchasing decisions on the spot or subsequent to the show. The participation of these qualified buyers makes our trade shows compelling events for our exhibitors, offering them an efficient platform for high quality lead generation. Our attendees use our shows for a variety of reasons, most notably to fulfill procurement needs, source new suppliers, reconnect with existing suppliers, identify trends, learn about new products and network with industry peers. We believe that these factors help demonstrate that our in-person shows are paramount and difficult to replace. Our portfolio of trade shows is well-balanced and diversified across both industry sectors and customers. The scale and qualified attendance at our trade shows translates into an exceptional value proposition for participants, resulting in a self-reinforcing “network effect,” whereby the participation of high-value attendees and exhibitors drives high participant loyalty and predictable, recurring revenue streams.
 Content: In addition to organizing our trade shows, conferences and other events, we also operate content and content-marketing websites and related digital products, and produce publications, each of which is aligned with a specific event sector.
Commerce: We offer B2B e-commerce and digital merchandising solutions, serving the needs of manufacturers and retailers through our Elastic Suite and Bulletin platforms, which create a digital year-round transactional platform for use by Emerald’s customers, regardless of location. In addition to their respective revenues, each of these products supports our live events by delivering 365-day engagement and active channels for customer acquisition and development.
 We also generate a substantial amount of first-party data across our events, content, and e-commerce platforms. We are in the process of developing products and processes based on our first-party data assets to enhance the customer experience, by providing actionable insights and measurable results through metrics such as content impressions, lead capture rates, conversion rates and transaction value per customer. Our efforts to provide customers with a clearer picture of the return on investment they receive from Emerald’s events should help incentivize customers to deploy more marketing dollars with Emerald, ultimately driving higher revenue per customer. The data we generate should also create efficiencies within Emerald’s sales efforts by enabling cross-selling of events, content, and e-commerce opportunities, contributing to lower sales costs and higher margins.
 Our History
In June 2013, certain investment funds managed by an affiliate of Onex Corporation (such funds, collectively with Onex Partners V LP, “Onex”) acquired our business from an affiliate of Nielsen Holdings N.V. (the “Onex Acquisition”). We have since focused on expanding our portfolio of leading events organically, complemented by an increased focus on acquisitions. Since the Onex Acquisition, we have acquired and integrated 25 industry-leading,

high-quality events and complementary businesses of various sizes for aggregate consideration of approximately $921 million.
 In June 2020, we entered into an investment agreement with Onex Partners V LP (“Onex Partners V”), pursuant to which we agreed to issue to Onex Partners V, in a private placement transaction, 47,058,332 shares of our 7% Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the “redeemable convertible preferred stock”) for a purchase price of $5.60 per share (the “Series A Price per Share”), for which we received aggregate proceeds of approximately $252.0 million, net of fees and estimated expenses of $11.6 million. In conjunction with the investment agreement with Onex Partners V, we announced a rights offering to holders of our outstanding common stock of one non-transferable subscription right for each share of our common stock held, with each right entitling the holder to purchase one share of redeemable convertible preferred stock at the Series A Price per Share, backstopped by Onex Partners V (the “Onex Backstop”). The rights offering was completed in July of 2020. We received net proceeds of approximately $9.7 million from this rights offering. Pursuant to the Onex Backstop, on August 13, 2020, an additional 22,660,587 shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were sold to Onex in exchange for proceeds of approximately $121.3 million, net of fees and expenses of $5.6 million.
As of December 31, 2022, Onex owned 47,058,332 shares of our common stock, representing 69.6% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, Onex owned 69,718,919 shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock, representing 178,807,950 shares of our common stock on an as-converted basis, after accounting for the accumulated accreting return at a rate per annum equal to 7% on the accreted liquidation preference and paid in-kind. Onex’s beneficial ownership of our common stock, on an as-converted basis, is approximately 88.3%.
 In 2022, we completed two acquisitions. In June, we acquired Advertising Week, a global event and thought leadership platform focused on marketing, media, technology, and culture. In July, we acquired Bulletin, an online wholesale market for retail where brands, buyers and designers gather to connect and discover new products. We believe this acquisition will infuse the NY NOW Gift and Home Show with Bulletin's industry expertise and extensive customer base of brands and retailers.
In 2021, we completed two acquisitions. In April, we acquired Sue Bryce Education and the Portrait Masters, a subscription-based photography business education and e-learning service with a photography conference.
 On December 31, 2021, we purchased substantially all of the assets associated with a business known and operated as MJBiz (“MJBiz”), a leading event producer and content platform serving the wide range of commercial companies operating in the rapidly growing cannabis industry. MJBiz produces MJBizCon, the oldest and leading B2B cannabis trade show in America; the Emerald conference, which focuses on science and data analysis in the cannabis industry; and media brands including MjBizDaily, Hemp Industry Daily and MJBIZ Magazine. At the November 2022 live event, MJBizCon featured more than 1,400 exhibiting companies and 22,400 attendees. In addition to diversifying and enhancing Emerald’s portfolio in a high growth industry, the addition of MJBiz further accelerates our strategy of delivering 365-day customer engagement.
 
Products and Services
 We operate leading trade shows in multiple attractive, fragmented industry sectors that represent significant portions of the U.S. economy and serve a large and diverse set of global exhibitors and attendees. This fragmentation of exhibitors and attendees is an especially important characteristic of the trade show industry. Trade shows provide a centralized platform for interaction between large numbers of qualified buyers and sellers (a “many-to-many” environment) within a short period of time, thus enhancing the value delivered to all trade show participants. Further, the highly fragmented nature of our markets enhances the stability of our entire platform as the loss of any single exhibitor or attendee is unlikely to affect the value delivered to and participation of other exhibitors or attendees.
Trade Shows & Other Events
 The following is a summary of several of our trade shows and other events by sector and a discussion of our complementary products.
 Retail
 Spanning a vast market of products, our retail experiences cover merchandising, licensing, sourcing, and marketing to enable professionals to shop intelligently, make informed decisions, and meet consumer demands. Buying customers are able to discover rare finds and big sellers in a complete marketplace of options, along with new brands, potential partners, and beneficial seminars across popular and profitable categories. Events produced in this category include:

☐ ASD Market Week (“ASD”) | ☐ JA New York 
☐ COUTURE | ☐ NY NOW 
☐ Impressions | ☐ Outdoor Retailer (“OR”) 
☐ Pizza Expo☐ MJ BizCon | ☐ RetailX☐ International Gift Exposition in the Smokies (“IGES) 
☐ Sports Licensing & Tailgate Show | ☐ Surf Expo 

Design & Construction
 Our shows in the Design & Construction industry sector catering to the construction, hospitality, and interior design sectors serving the hotel, resort, retail, healthcare facilities, restaurant, bar, spa, and in-store marketing categories. Targeted attendees include interior designers, architects, owners and operators, developers, and specifiers and purchasers working within these industries. This sector is well-suited for trade shows because design and construction are highly visual and tactile processes, requiring the in-person experience and interaction provided by trade shows. By aggregating a wide range of products under one roof, these trade shows save time and expense for designers and other attendees who would otherwise have to independently visit hundreds of showrooms that may be located in different cities. Examples of our events produced in this category include:

☐ Boutique Design New York (“BDNY”) | ☐ Hospitality Design Expo 
☐ Environments for Aging Expo & Conference (“EFA”) | ☐ ICFF (previously International Contemporary Furniture Fair) 
☐ Healthcare Design Expo & Conference ☐ EDspaces | ☐ Kitchen & Bath Industry Show (“KBIS”) 

Technology
 With technology expanding at a rapid pace, professionals in every aspect of commerce—from engineering to electronics, and visual arts to security—must stay on top of the latest advancements to help them stay informed, efficient, and competitive. Our technology events provide experiences that connect businesses of all sizes with innovative products, operational strategies, and integration opportunities to drive new business, increased profits, and streamlined processes. Through exciting show floors, thought leadership, and networking events, decision-makers in these industries can thrive in the midst of digital progress and change. Some examples of our events produced in this category include:

☐ CEDIA Expo | ☐ Prosper 


☐ Digital Dealer | ☐ RFID Journal Live (“RFID Live”) 

Equipment
 Our equipment experiences outfit aerospace, construction, industrial, medical, and hospitality professionals with the tools and resources necessary to operate, build, and repair structures, vehicles, and devices of every kind. These events and surrounding platforms serve as a marketplace featuring vendors and innovative products and services, as well as educational centers, supporting a wide array of industries. Examples of our events produced in this category include:

☐ Fastener | ☐ National Pavement Expo 
☐ Medtrade | ☐ PhotoPlus Expo 
☐ Sue Bryce Education and the Portrait Masters | ☐ Wedding & Portrait Photographers International 

Safety
 Seeking the innovations to ensure physical and cyber security, these experiences prepare professionals with advanced systems, training, and networking. With an integration of events and media, representatives and decision-makers from leading-edge companies have access to key resources year-round. Examples of our events produced in this category include:

☐ Campus Safety | ☐ Security Sales & Integration 
☐ Marine Military Expos | 

Other Marketing Services
 Other Marketing Services consist of print publications and digital media products that complement our trade show properties, which generated 9.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. These print and digital media products are closely aligned with several of our events across the portfolio categories, facilitating year-round customer contact, new customer generation and content marketing vehicles. Some examples of these products are:

☐ Healthcare Design | ☐ Kitchen & Bath Business (“KBB”) 
☐ Hospitality Design | ☐ Pizza Today 
☐ MJBiz Daily | 

Subscription Software and Services
 We provide software-as-a-service technology through our Elastic Suite platform. Elastic Suite’s platform streamlines the wholesale buying process for both brands and retail buyers, creating a digital year-round transactional platform for use by Emerald’s customers. We believe this platform will accelerate Emerald’s strategy to provide 365-day-per-year engagement for our customer base, regardless of location, by expanding our digital commerce capabilities and providing our customers with transactional functionality, including enterprise-level integration to brands’ enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems, allowing customers to manage orders, real-time inventory, and product merchandising. Elastic Suite is integrated with leading manufacturers and retailers across numerous industries, most notably in the outdoor, surf, cycling, footwear and sporting goods verticals, and is expected to complement Emerald’s portfolio of leading show brands, including OR and Surf Expo, among others. Elastic Suite’s B2B platform bridges the gap between sellers’ order processing systems and allows brands to sell directly to their buyers using

print-free digital product catalogs and merchandising technology, enabling brands to increase their efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and profitability.
 Reportable Segments
 As described in Note 18, Segment Information, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the determination of our reportable segments is consistent with the information provided our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered the chief operating decision-maker (the "CODM"). The CODM evaluates performance based on the results of seven executive brand portfolios, which represent our seven operating segments. Based on an evaluation of economic similarities and the nature of services and types of customers, five of these operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments, the "Commerce" reportable segment and the "Design, Creative & Technology" reportable segment. The remaining two operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds to be considered reportable segments and are included in the “All Other” category. In addition, we have a "Corporate-Level Activities" category consisting of finance, legal, information technology and administrative functions. Prior year disclosures below have been updated to reflect the new reportable segment structure described in Note 18, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Segment Information.”
 The following discussion provides additional detailed disclosure for the two reportable segments, the "All Other" category and the "Corporate-Level Activity" category:
 Commerce: This segment includes events and services covering merchandising, licensing, retail sourcing and marketing to enable professionals to make informed decisions and meet consumer demands.
Design, Creative & Technology: This segment includes events and services that support a wide variety of industries connecting businesses and professionals with products, operational strategies, and integration opportunities to drive new business and streamline processes and creative solutions.
All Other: This category consists of Emerald’s remaining operating segments, which provide diverse events and services but are not aggregated with the reportable segments.
Corporate-Level Activity: This category consists of Emerald’s finance, legal, information technology and administrative functions.
Competition
The trade show industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 9,400 B2B trade shows held per year in the United States according to the Center for Exhibition Industry Research, of which a majority are owned by industry associations, according to Advanced Market Research. Individual trade shows typically compete for attendees and exhibitors only against the other trade shows that are relevant to their industry vertical. The level of competition each of our trade shows faces therefore varies by industry vertical. In addition, the Elastic Suite platform competes with several other well-capitalized software-as-a-service technology platforms.
 Other well-established for-profit companies competing in the U.S. trade show industry include Reed Exhibitions, Informa Exhibitions and Clarion Events.
 Seasonality
 As is typical for the trade show industry, our business has historically been seasonal, with our pre-COVID revenue recognized from trade shows typically reaching its highest level during the first and third quarters of each calendar year, entirely due to the timing of our trade shows. As a result of the MJBiz and Advertising Week acquisitions at the end of 2021 and during the second quarter of 2022, respectively, our seasonality trend shifted, where revenue now typically reaches its highest level during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year, entirely due to the timing of our live events.
Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We undertake to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by registering our trademarks. We currently rely primarily on trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We do not own, but have a license to use, certain trademarks belonging to an industry association in connection with our KBIS and CEDIA Expo. The KBIS license runs through 2043 and the CEDIA Expo license continues in perpetuity. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property and Information Technology” for further discussion relating to our trademarks.
Human Capital Resources
 At Emerald, we consider our employees to be the foundation of our growth and success. As such, our future depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified and diverse personnel.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 759 full-time employees. Our management team principally works from our New York City headquarters (60 employees) and our Southern California corporate offices (67 employees), with members of our sales team located throughout the United States, mainly near the geographic markets they serve. As of February 2, 2023, our senior management team was 49% female and our overall employee population was 63% female.
Career development at Emerald is fostered through ongoing employee feedback, performance reviews and employee satisfaction surveys. These surveys regularly solicit employees’ to help Emerald track progress and the well-being of our workforce. In addition to monthly town halls conducted by our CEO, which foster transparent and consistent communication throughout the company, Emerald hosts a company-wide, in-person conference called ACE (Agility, Commitment and Excellence). ACE brings team members from around the country together to reconnect, face-to-face, and take part in presentations from top executives and smaller breakout sessions that focused on Emerald’s new business ventures, strategic roadmap and an employee award presentation which recognized individuals chosen by their peers as true leaders.
 Emerald’s corporate culture and benefits offerings are also designed to meet the wide range of needs of our workforce including:
•Flexible work hours and paid time off policy for employees to do their best work;
 •Comprehensive welfare package that includes a wide variety of benefits, such as domestic partner coverage, medical, dental and vision plan options with reduced premiums;
 •Opportunities to build a solid financial foundation, including 401k plans with an employer match and the ability to participate in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan;
 •Opportunities to give back in impactful ways through the Emerald Cares volunteer program; and
 •On-the-job training, development opportunities, and quality experiences designed to help all Emerald team members elevate their knowledge, and skills, and to further their careers. 
 These resources are intended to support the physical, emotional and financial well-being of our employees.
 In order to protect our workforce from the outbreak of COVID-19, in March 2020, Emerald transitioned all of our employees to a remote/work-from-home arrangement, and as of November 2021, we permanently adopted a hybrid work structure whereby employees have the flexibility to work from home and come in to the office to maximize in-person collaboration As we have resumed in-person events, we have prioritized the health and safety of our employees as well as our exhibitors and attendees, taking extensive COVID-19 protective measures.
Emerald is not involved in any material disputes with our employees and we believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unions. However, some facilities where we hold our trade shows require our decorators to use unionized labor.

Commitment to Corporate Sustainability and Governance
 Emerald is dedicated to advancing its Environmental, Social and Governance practices. To that end, we are committed to minimizing our environmental impact with the goal of reducing the environmental footprint of our events. In partnership with the global Net Zero Carbon Events initiative, Emerald has taken the Net Zero Carbon Events pledge to chart a path towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050, with an interim goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030. As part of this pledge, we have undertaken to identify and prioritize actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including energy management, water conservation, materials management, food and beverage waste reduction, sustainable procurement, stakeholder management and employee engagement initiatives.
We are working to develop, gather and track key event metrics to measure the environmental impact of our events and benchmark success against our pledged goals. We intend to collaborate with key partners and suppliers throughout the event industry, including venues, hotels, and general service contractors in furtherance of our sustainability initiatives.
Emerald also knows its ultimate success is directly linked to its ability to identify and hire talented individuals from all backgrounds and perspectives, and we are committed to developing and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion. In January 2022, we hired an experienced leader to act as our Chair of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, who helps us to build upon our existing programs and maintain best practices to foster a diverse and inclusive work environment. Further, as part of our commitment to equity, we have partnered with the non-profit organization called OneTen, which cultivates economic opportunities for Black talent in the United States with a goal of providing one million jobs to Black individuals within the next ten years. In order to partner with OneTen, employers must agree to certain commitments, such as significantly increasing the hiring of Black employees for family-sustaining jobs that do not require 4-year college degrees. At the same time, we have also eliminated the college-degree requirement for a range of positions to expand the application process to include candidates with more diverse backgrounds, skills and experiences. We also require all hiring personnel to attend training programs focused on unconscious bias training and interview skills. Notably, Emerald is one of fifteen organizations that formed The COUTURE Diversity Action Council ("DAC"), which strives to be a catalyst for addressing the issues of systemic and institutionalized discrimination that have contributed to the lack of diversity within the fine jewelry industry. DAC’s purpose is to contribute to the creation of a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable industry through the implementation of mentoring and other programs and initiatives that promote and support Black, Indigenous, People of Color ("BIPOC") within all facets of the jewelry ecosystem.
Providing all our employees with the resources to develop their talents, grow their careers and reach their goals is a top priority at Emerald. To enable this, the Company provides numerous opportunities for employees to expand their professional and personal development, including unlimited access to Skillsoft’s online platform which provides continuous learning and career enhancement resources coupled with formal sales development and training from a professional sales coach. Emerald also offers a yearlong wellness program led by a top mindfulness coach focused on employees’ mental health and well-being.
Insurance
 We maintain insurance policies to cover the principal risks associated with our business, including event cancellation, business interruption, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, cyber security, product liability, auto, property, and umbrella and excess liability insurance. All of our insurance policies are with third-party carriers and syndicates with financial ratings of A or better. We believe the premiums, deductibles, coverage limits and scope of coverage under such policies are reasonable and appropriate for our business. Event cancellation insurance provides coverage that allows us to refund a proportionate share, relative to the compromised enforced attendance reduction or show closure, of the deposits and booth and sponsorship fees paid to us by exhibitors in the event that we are forced to cancel a trade show or other event for reasons covered by the policies, such as natural disasters, terrorism, or venue closures. Business interruption insurance provides further coverage for our office property leases in cases where we are not able to conduct ongoing business, including sales and event planning. The continued availability of appropriate insurance policies on commercially reasonable terms is important to our ability to operate our business and to maintain our reputation.


 Our event cancellation insurance policies protect against losses due to the unavoidable cancellation, postponement, relocation and enforced reduced attendance at events due to certain covered causes. Specifically, for the policies covering calendar years 2020 and 2021, these causes included event cancellation caused by the outbreak of communicable diseases, including COVID-19. However, coverage for the outbreak of communicable disease, including COVID-19, is not included in our 2022 or subsequent event cancellation insurance policies. In addition, coverage for each of our event cancellation insurance policies extends to include additional promotional and marketing expenses necessarily incurred by us should a covered loss occur. These policies also include a terrorism endorsement covering an act of terrorism and/or threat of terrorism directed at the insured event or within the United States or its territories. The aggregate limit for our renewed 2022 primary event cancellation insurance policy is $100.0 million. The Company also obtained a similar separate event cancellation insurance policy for the Surf Expo Winter 2022 and Surf Expo Summer 2022 shows, with a coverage limit of $8.4 million and $6.5 million, respectively.
 On August 3, 2022, we reached an agreement to settle outstanding insurance litigation relating to event cancellation insurance for proceeds of $148.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded other income, net of $182.8 million related to event cancellation insurance claim and settlement proceeds deemed to be realizable by our management team. All of the other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 was received during the period. We received payments of $95.2 million from our insurance carrier to recover the lost revenues, net of costs saved, of the affected trade shows during the year ended December 31, 2021 and we concluded that the receipt of $17.8 million of additional insurance proceeds was realizable as of December 31, 2020. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we reported other income, net of $77.4 million to recognize the amount that was recovered from the insurance company. We received payments of $89.2 million from our insurance carrier to recover the lost revenues, net of costs saved, of the affected trade shows during the year ended December 31, 2020 and we concluded that the receipt of $17.8 million of additional insurance proceeds was realizable as of December 31, 2020. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported other income, net of $107.0 million to recognize the amount that was recovered from the insurance company.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further discussion relating to our event cancellation insurance coverage and proceeds received under the Company’s policies.
