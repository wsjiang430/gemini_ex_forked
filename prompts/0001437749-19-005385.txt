General Description of Business
 
Prime Meridian Holding Company (“PMHG”) was incorporated as a Florida corporation on May 25, 2010, and is the one-bank holding company for and sole shareholder of Prime Meridian Bank (the “Bank”). The Bank opened for business on February 4, 2008, and was acquired by PMHG on September 16, 2010. PMHG has no significant operations other than owning the stock of the Bank. In this report, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean PMHG and its subsidiary. Since opening in 2008, the Bank has conducted a general banking business and has grown to seventy-nine full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees as of December 31, 2018.
History
 
Prime Meridian Bank, a Florida commercial bank, was chartered on February 4, 2008, with a commitment to providing a high level of client service while maintaining sound and prudent banking practices. In 2010, our holding company, PMHG, was formed and the Bank’s shareholders exchanged their shares of common stock for shares of common stock of PMHG, with the Bank becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of PMHG. This occurred through a statutory share exchange on September 16, 2010. The Company commenced a public offering registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 11, 2013, has continued to file periodic reports with the SEC since that date, and became listed and publicly traded on the OTCQX marketplace on August 24, 2015.
 
In an effort to provide a superior level of service, we are building a culture and brand that fosters client relationships and creates an inviting atmosphere rather than simply processing customers’ transactions. We want a culture that supports relationship banking. This culture has served us well, with many of our clients referring others to us. In our view, there is no greater compliment than to have our existing clients share their positive banking experiences with their family and friends.
 
Our team developed and adopted the following five core principles to support our actions and guide our decisions:
 

● | Passion – A level of intense excellence and commitment that goes over and above merely meeting the commercial considerations and legal requirements - Never give up. Never settle for mediocrity. Never let fear hamper us from taking calculated risks. Above all, Never let a cynic stand in our way.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grace - Providing a high level of service, with courtesy and compassion. Having an awareness of how our actions, body language, and words affect others. Learning to master a mindful, calm response to any situation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integrity – Doing the right thing, simply because it is the right thing to do, based on a firm adherence to the Bank’s three-way test: (1) Is it right by the client? (2) Is it right by the Bank? (3) Is it legally, morally, and ethically correct?
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tenacity – A culture of looking at new ideas, tackling challenges, and overcoming obstacles in order to meet our clients’ needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accountability – Accepting full and ultimate responsibility for the situation or action at hand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These core principles and the Bank’s three-way test also serve as the foundation for our motto, “Let’s think of a few good reasons why it CAN be done!” which is an overarching concept for our Company and team. We stress the question “Why?” because, while we clearly recognize that “how” is imperative, without understanding “why” something should be done, “how it can be done” does not necessarily matter. Our mission statement is also supported by our core principles: “Building bankers to serve our clients and community in order to optimize shareholder value.” As a result of our efforts and culture, we have been able to increase our asset and deposit base exclusively through organic growth thus far.
 
Location and Service Area
 
Prime Meridian Bank is headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida and offers a broad range of banking services to the Tallahassee Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”) and the surrounding North Florida and South Georgia areas. The Company is headquartered at 1897 Capital Circle NE, Second Floor, Tallahassee, Florida 32308 in the Bank’s second location, which opened on February 21, 2012. The Bank also serves clients from a branch office located at the Bank’s original main office at 1471 Timberlane Road, Suite 124, Tallahassee, Florida 32312 and from its branch office located at 2201 Crawfordville Highway, Crawfordville, Florida 32327, which opened in September, 2015. On November 20, 2018, the Company filed application with, and subsequently received approval from, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) to establish a full-service branch office at 3340 South Florida Avenue, Lakeland, Florida 33830. The Company expects to open this office during the second quarter of 2019.

A substantial portion of the Company’s market is located in the larger Tallahassee MSA. Claritas, using primarily United States Census Bureau data, estimates that the 2019 population of the Tallahassee MSA, which includes Leon, Gadsden, Jefferson, and Wakulla counties, is 390,489 and is expected to grow to 408,083 or 4.51% by 2024. Tallahassee is the state capital and is characterized by mostly small businesses in many different service industries in addition to significant governmental and educational employment. The Tallahassee MSA is furthermore home to over 70,000 college students with two state universities (Florida State University and Florida A&M University) and Tallahassee Community College, one of the largest community colleges in Florida. The region is thought to be attractive for many types of economic development. The Economic Development Council of Tallahassee/Leon County previously identified seven targeted industry sectors that match the region’s strengths, goals, and assets: (1) renewable energy and environment; (2) aviation and aerospace; (3) health sciences, medical education, training and research, and sports medicine; (4) information technology; (5) research and engineering; (6) transportation and logistics; and (7) advanced manufacturing.
 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national unemployment rate and Florida’s unemployment rate were 3.9% and 3.3%, respectively, at December 31, 2018, while Tallahassee’s unemployment rate was reported at 3.3%. Any increases in unemployment rates could result in nonperforming loans and reduced asset quality.
 
Banking Services
 
Our business strategy focuses on traditional, relationship-based banking. The Bank provides a range of consumer and commercial banking services to individuals and businesses. In addition to electronic banking services such as mobile banking, remote deposit, mobile deposit, Apple Pay, Bank-to-Bank transfers and online banking, we offer basic services which include demand interest-bearing and non-interest bearing accounts, savings accounts, money-market deposit accounts, health savings accounts (HSA), NOW accounts, time deposits, safe deposit services, wire transfers, foreign exchange services, escrow accounts, debit cards, direct deposits, notary services, night depository, official checks, domestic collections, bank drafts, automated teller services, drive-in tellers, banking by mail, credit cards through a third party, and merchant card services with a third party. In addition, the Bank issues standby letters of credit and offers commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, construction loans, commercial loans, equipment loans, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, and consumer loans. The Bank provides debit and automated teller machine (“ATM”) cards and is a member of the MoneyPASS and Pulse networks, thereby permitting clients to utilize the convenience of a large ATM network system including more than 400,000 member machines nationwide. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank did not have trust powers.
 
Our organizational structure focuses on a strong risk management culture. We stay abreast of our market by having our Board and management team highly involved in our communities. We believe our team's banking experience and high-quality client service distinguishes us from other banks. We believe this foundation will enable us to expand our products and services to new and existing clients, resulting in steady, long-term growth. Our culture focuses on servicing our clients and proactively exceeding their expectations, which in turn supports client retention and loyalty, increased referrals, and enhanced profitability.
 
Our loan target market includes owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied commercial real estate, small businesses, real estate developers, consumers, and professionals. Small business clients are typically commercial entities with sales of $25 million or less; these clients have the opportunity to generate significant revenue for banks.
 
Our revenues are primarily derived from interest income and fees on loans, interest and dividends from investment securities, and service charge income generated from demand accounts, ATM fees, and other services. The principal sources of funds for the Bank’s lending activities are its deposits, loan repayments, and proceeds from investment securities. The principal expenses of the Bank are the interest paid on deposits, salaries, and general operating expenses.
 
We are committed to being a successful community bank and being a good business partner within our community. We believe our active community involvement and business development strategies, in conjunction with our client relationship culture, have formed a successful foundation for developing new relationships and enhancing existing ones.
 
Lending Activities
 
The Bank offers a wide range of lending services to the community, providing loans to small to medium sized companies and their owners and not-for-profit organizations. Included in our array of commercial loan products are commercial real estate loans, equipment loans, small business loans, business lines of credit, and SBA loans. Consumer loans include residential first and second mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, and consumer installment loans for cars, trucks, boats, and other recreational vehicles. Most of our retail lending connections are driven by our commercial and mortgage client relationships. The Bank maintains strong and disciplined credit policies and procedures and makes loans on a nondiscriminatory basis throughout its lending area. The net loan portfolio, excluding loans held for sale, constituted 72.2% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2018.

Our lenders have the authority to extend credit under guidelines established and approved by the Board of Directors. With the exception of secured consumer loans, joint approval signatures are required for all loans. Officers may not combine their lending authority to approve a loan in an amount in excess of the lending authority of the officer with the greater authority, unless otherwise provided through the approved lending authority table. However, a loan officer may obtain the approval of another officer with a higher lending authority to grant a loan. The Loan Committee approves all loans with an aggregate indebtedness that exceeds an officer’s or co-approving officer’s lending authority, staying within the Company’s in-house and legal lending limits. The voting members of the Bank’s Loan Committee consist of at least five directors, with at least two of those five being nonemployee Board members. Alternates or designates may be appointed by the Board of Directors when needed. Loan Committee generally meets at least bi-weekly to consider any loan requests which are in excess of the lending limits of individual lending officers and require approval before the disbursement of proceeds and to review all other loans for compliance with our loan policy. Liquidity and stability in the Bank’s portfolio are given the highest priority; therefore, the Board of Directors reviews the portfolio mix of loans at its monthly meetings. Actions of the Loan Committee are also reported to the Board of Directors at these monthly meetings.
 
We categorize our loans as follows: commercial real estate, residential real estate (first and second mortgages and home equity loans), construction loans, commercial loans, and consumer loans. Residential real estate and home equity loans, accounting for 41.4% of the loan portfolio, and commercial real estate loans, comprising 28.1% of the loan portfolio, were the two largest categories of loans at December 31, 2018.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans.  Secured by mortgages on commercial property, these loans are typically more complex and present a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate loans. Commercial loans that are secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate are repaid through operating cash flows of the borrower whereas nonowner-occupied commercial real estate loans are generally dependent on rental income. The typical amortization period is twenty years or less. Interest rates on our commercial real estate loans are generally fixed for five years or less after which they adjust based upon a predetermined spread over an index. At times, a rate may be fixed for longer than five years. As part of our credit underwriting standards, we normally require personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business supported by a review of the principal owners’ personal financial statements, personal tax returns, and where applicable, business tax returns. As part of our enterprise risk management process, we understand that risks associated with commercial real estate loans include fluctuations in real estate values, the overall strength of the borrower, the overall strength of the economy, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, environmental contamination, and the quality of the borrowers’ management. In order to mitigate and limit these risks, we evaluate collateral value and analyze the borrower’s, and if applicable the guarantor’s, global cash flow position. Currently, the collateral securing our commercial real estate loans includes a variety of property types, such as office, warehouse, and retail facilities, multifamily properties, hotels, mixed-use residential and commercial properties.
Residential Real Estate and Home Equity Loans. The Company offers first and second one-to-four family mortgage loans, multifamily residential loans, and home equity lines of credit. The collateral for these loans includes both owner-occupied residences and nonowner-occupied investment properties. The owner-occupied primary residence loans generally present lower levels of risk than commercial real estate loans; however, risks do still exist because of possible fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrowers' financial condition. The nonowner-occupied investment properties are more similar in risk to commercial real estate loans, and therefore, are underwritten by assessing the property’s income potential and appraised value. In both cases, we underwrite the borrower’s financial condition and evaluate his or her global cash flow position. Borrowers may be affected by numerous factors, including job loss, illness, or other personal hardship. As part of our product mix, the Company offers both portfolio and secondary market mortgages; portfolio loans generally are based on a 3-year, 5-year, or 7-year adjustable rate mortgages; while 15-year or 30-year fixed-rate loans are generally sold to the secondary market. The longer-term, fixed-rate loans are sometimes retained in the Company’s loan portfolio and are evaluated on a case by case basis.
Construction Loans. Typically, these loans have a term of one to two years and the interest is paid monthly. Once the construction period terminates, some of these loans will convert to a term loan carried in the Bank’s loan portfolio with an amortization period of twenty years or less, in general. This portion of our loan portfolio includes loans to small-to-medium sized businesses to construct owner-user properties, loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties, and loans to residential developers. This type of loan is also made to individual clients for construction of single-family homes in our market area. An independent appraisal is generally used to determine the value of the collateral and confirm that the ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral will not exceed the Bank’s policies. As the construction project progresses, loan proceeds are requested by the borrower to complete phases of construction, and funding is only disbursed after the project has been inspected by a third-party inspector or an experienced construction lender. Risks associated with construction loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, project completion risk, changes in market trends, and the interest rate environment. The ability of the construction loan borrower to move to permanent financing of the loan or sell the property upon completion of the project is another risk factor that also may be affected by changes in market trends after the initial funding of the loan.

Commercial Loans. The Company offers a wide range of commercial loans, including small business loans, equipment financing, business lines of credit, and SBA loans. Small-to-medium sized businesses, retail, and professional establishments, make up our target market for commercial loans. Our lenders primarily underwrite these loans based on the borrower’s ability to service the loan from cash flow. Lines of credit and loans secured by accounts receivable and/or inventory are monitored periodically by our staff. Loans secured by “all business assets,” or a “blanket lien” are typically only made to highly qualified borrowers due to the nonspecific nature of the collateral and do not require a formal valuation of the business collateral. When commercial loans are secured by specifically identified collateral, then the valuation of the collateral is generally supported by an appraisal, purchase order, or third-party physical inspection. Personal guarantees of the principals of business borrowers are usually required. Equipment loans generally have a term of five years or less and may have a fixed or variable rate. Business lines of credit generally do not exceed two years and typically, are secured by accounts receivable and inventory. Significant factors affecting a commercial borrower’s credit-worthiness include the quality of management and the ability to evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting the business’ markets for products and services and respond effectively to such changes. These loans may be made unsecured or secured, but most are made on a secured basis. Risks associated with our commercial loan portfolio include local, regional, and national market conditions. Other risk factors could include changes in the borrower’s management and fluctuations in collateral value. Additionally, there may be refinancing risk if a commercial loan includes a balloon payment which must be refinanced or paid off at loan maturity. In reference to our risk management process, our commercial loan portfolio presents a higher risk profile than our residential real estate and consumer loan portfolios. Therefore, we require that all loans to businesses must have a clearly stated and reasonable payment plan to allow for timely retirement of debt.
Consumer and Other Loans. Our consumer portfolio is the smallest portion of our loan portfolio, representing 2.3% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. These loans are made for various consumer purposes, such as the financing of automobiles, boats, and recreational vehicles. The payment structure of these loans is normally on an installment basis. The risk associated with this category of loans stems from the reduced collateral value for a defaulted loan; it may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the principal. The underwriting on these loans is primarily based on the borrower’s financial condition. Therefore, both secured and unsecured consumer loans subject the Company to risk when the borrower’s financial condition declines or deteriorates. Based upon our current trend in consumer loans, we do not anticipate that consumer loans will become a substantial component of our loan portfolio at any time in the immediate future. Consumer loans are made at fixed-interest and variable-interest rates and are based on the appropriate amortization for the asset and purpose.
Investments

Our investments are managed in relation to loan demand and deposit growth. Available funds are placed in low risk investments and provide liquidity to fund increases in loan demand or to offset fluctuations in deposits. With respect to our investment portfolio, the total portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasuries, general obligations of government agencies, and bank-qualified municipal securities because such securities generally represent a minimal investment risk. Occasionally, we may invest in certificates of deposit from national and state banks. We also invest in mortgage-backed securities which generally have a shorter life than the stated maturity.
 
We monitor changes in financial markets. In addition to portfolio investments, our daily cash position is monitored to ensure that all available funds earn interest at the earliest possible date. A portion of the investment account is designated as secondary reserves and invested in liquid securities that can be readily converted to cash with minimum risk of market loss. These investments usually consist of U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Government agencies and federal funds. The remainder of the investment account may be placed in investment securities of a different type and longer maturity. Whenever possible, our strategy is to stagger the maturities of our securities to produce a steady cash-flow in the event the Bank needs cash, or economic conditions change to a more favorable rate environment.
 
Deposit Activities
 
Deposits are the major source of the Bank’s funds for lending and other investment purposes. Deposits are gathered principally from within our primary market area through the offering of a broad variety of deposit products, including checking accounts, money-market accounts, regular savings accounts, term certificate of deposit accounts (including “jumbo” certificates in denominations of $250,000 or more), and retirement savings plans. We consider the majority of our regular savings, demand, NOW, and money-market deposit accounts to be core deposits. The majority of our deposits are generated within the Leon County, Florida area. Our deposits are insured up to the maximum amount allowed by law by the FDIC and we operate under the supervision and regulations of the FDIC and the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation (“OFR”). The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted on May 24, 2018 amended Section 29 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to except a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions. With this change in regulation, the Company set up and began testing Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service Insured Cash Sweep accounts in the fourth quarter of 2018 with plans to begin offering these products in 2019. The Bank had no brokered deposits at December 31, 2018 or 2017.
 
Maturity terms, service fees, and withdrawal penalties are established by the Bank on a periodic basis. The determination of rates and terms is predicated on funds acquisition and liquidity requirements, market rate competition, growth goals, and federal regulations.

We offer certificates of deposit, including time deposits of $250,000 or more, public fund deposits and other large deposit accounts. More than half our time deposits are short-term in nature and are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than other types of deposits; therefore, they may be a less stable source of funds. In the event that existing short-term deposits are not renewed, the resulting loss of the deposited funds could adversely affect our liquidity. In a rising interest rate market, short-term deposits may prove to be a costly source of funds because their short-term nature requires renewal at increasingly higher interest rates, which may adversely affect the Bank’s earnings. The opposite is true in a falling interest rate market where such short-term deposits are more favorable to the Bank.
 
Company Website and U.S. Securities Exchange Commission Filings
 
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports can be found free of charge on our website at www.primemeridianbank.com as soon as reasonably practical after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC maintains a website, www.sec.gov, which contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our charters of the Audit Committee and the Compensation and Nominating Committee, along with our Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy are available on our website at www.primemeridianbank.com. Printed copies of this information may also be obtained, without charge, by written request to the Corporate Secretary at P.O. Box 13629, Tallahassee, FL 32317.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, PMHG had seventy-nine full time equivalent employees (including executive officers), none of whom are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management considers employee relations to be good.
Competition

The market for banking is highly competitive. Our competition is made up of a wide range of financial institutions, including credit unions, local, regional, and national commercial banks, mortgage companies, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services. According to the annual Summary of Deposits report produced by the FDIC, total deposits (excluding non-retail) in Leon and Wakulla counties, Florida, grew to approximately $7.4 billion as of June 30, 2018. As of June 30, 2018, there were fourteen FDIC-insured financial institutions serving Leon County; only two of them, including PMHG, are headquartered in Leon County. As of June 30, 2018, according to the Summary of Deposits, the Company had a 4.28% share of the FDIC-insured deposits in Leon County. As of June 30, 2018, the Summary of Deposits reported that there were four FDIC-insured financial institutions serving Wakulla County and that PMHG ranked number three, with a 11.58% share of the FDIC-insured deposits in Wakulla County.
 
Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and bank holding companies, resulting in lower cost structures. By emphasizing our exceptional client service, knowledge of local trends and conditions, and local decision-making process, we believe the Bank has developed an effective competitive advantage in its market, thus maintaining a strong level of growth. We also are actively engaged in Small Business Administration guaranteed financing to support local borrowers who might not otherwise qualify for conventional financing, which helps mitigate our credit risk and results in fee income if we sell the guaranteed portion.
 
Some of our competitors are much larger financial institutions with greater financial resources. It is not our goal to compete on all products and services, but rather to remain client-service focused and to adhere to our core principles. This strategy has yielded solid growth for the Bank thus far.
 
Other important competitive factors that have contributed to our success in our market area include convenient office hours, electronic banking products, community reputation, quality of our banking team, capacity and willingness to extend credit, and our ability to offer cash management and other commercial banking services. Although offering competitive rates is important, we believe that our greatest competitive advantages are our experienced management team, client relationship culture, and personal service.
 
Government Supervision and Regulation

General
 
As a one-bank holding company, we are subject to an extensive collection of state and federal banking laws and regulations, which impose specific requirements and restrictions on virtually all aspects of our operations. We are affected by government monetary policy and by regulatory measures affecting the banking industry in general. These regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, borrowers, the public, the FDIC, and the integrity of the U.S. banking system and capital markets. Future legislative enactments, changes in governmental policy, or changes in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts could have a material impact on our business, operations, and earnings. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect our ability to attract deposits, make loans, and achieve our planned operating results.

The following is a brief summary of some of the statutes, rules, and regulations that currently affect PMHG’s and the Bank’s operations. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision referred to below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to our business. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Prime Meridian Holding Company
 
As a bank holding company, PMHG is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and the examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). As such, the Company is required to file semi-annual reports and other information with the Federal Reserve regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiary. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any additional bank without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The Company is further prohibited from merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without prior approval.
 
Prior to any person or company, excluding a bank holding company, acquiring control of a bank holding company, subject to certain exemptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve, require either the Federal Reserve’s stated approval or a notice be furnished to the Federal Reserve and not disapproved. Control is conclusively presumed to exist when an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company. Control may be presumed to exist if a person acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either the bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. Additionally, the BHCA provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any of these transactions if it would result in a monopoly, substantially lessen competition, or otherwise function as a restraint of trade, unless the anti-competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve’s consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy, which is discussed below. As a result of the USA PATRIOT Act, the Federal Reserve is also required to consider the record of a bank holding company and its subsidiary bank(s) in combating money laundering activities in its evaluation of bank holding company merger or acquisition transactions.
 
Except as authorized by the BHCA and Federal Reserve regulations or orders, a bank holding company is generally prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect control of 5% or more of the voting shares of any company engaged in any business other than the business of banking or managing and controlling banks. The primary exception allows a bank holding company to own shares in any company whose activities have been determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks that ownership of shares of that company is appropriate. Activities the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation to be permissible for bank holding companies include the following:
 

● | making or servicing loans and certain types of leases;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | engaging in certain insurance activities;
--+------------------------------------------


● | performing certain data processing services;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | acting in certain circumstances as a fiduciary or investment or financial advisor;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | providing management consulting services;
--+------------------------------------------


● | owning savings associations;
--+-----------------------------


● | and making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In accordance with Federal Reserve Policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks. In adhering to the Federal Reserve’s policy, we may be required to provide financial support to the Bank at a time when, absent such Federal Reserve Policy, it might not be deemed advisable to provide such assistance. Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve may also require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve’s determination that the activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company. Further, federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) codified the Federal Reserve’s policy on serving as a source of financial strength. Such support may be required at times when, absent this Federal Reserve policy, a holding company may not be inclined to provide it. A bank holding company, in certain circumstances, could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary.
 
The Federal Reserve’s authority was expanded through the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”) to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices, or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. FIRREA increased the amount of civil money penalties which the Federal Reserve can assess for activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1.0 million for each day the activity continues. FIRREA also expanded the scope of the individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed.

Prime Meridian Bank
 
As a state-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the OFR and the FDIC. Our deposits are insured by the FDIC for a maximum of $250,000 per account ownership category. For this protection, we must pay a quarterly statutory assessment and comply with the rules and regulations of the FDIC. The assessment levied on a bank for deposit insurance varies, depending on the capital position of each bank, and other supervisory factors. Currently, we are subject to the statutory assessment.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of a bank, the claims of depositors of the bank, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against a bank. If a bank fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors and shareholders.
 
Areas regulated and monitored by the bank regulatory authorities include:
 

● | security devices and procedures;
--+---------------------------------


● | adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | loans;
--+-------


● | investments;
--+-------------


● | borrowings;
--+------------


● | deposits;
--+----------


● | mergers;
--+---------


● | issuances of securities;
--+-------------------------


● | payment of dividends;
--+----------------------


● | establishment of branches;
--+---------------------------


● | corporate reorganizations;
--+---------------------------


● | transactions with affiliates;
--+------------------------------


● | maintenance of books and records
--+---------------------------------


● | and adequacy of staff training to carry out safe lending and deposit gathering practices.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July, 2010 and provides for significant regulation and oversight of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, thrift charters, and changes among the banking regulatory agencies. There are many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act mandating regulators to adopt new regulations and conduct studies upon which future regulation may be based. While many have been issued, some remain to be issued and may have unintended effects on smaller banks.
 
The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act impact and may further impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to some of our business practices, or otherwise adversely affect our business. These impacts also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. It may further necessitate higher levels of regulatory capital and/or liquidity and lead to a change in our business strategy. We cannot predict the effects of this legislation and the corresponding regulations on us, our competitors, or on the financial markets and economy, although it may significantly increase costs and impede efficiency of internal business processes.
 
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders
 
Under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value to the parent holding company, and any other non-bank affiliates in so-called “covered transactions.” The term “covered transaction” includes loans, leases, other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, issuance of a guarantee, as well as other transactions involving the transfer of value from the Bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by the Bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus (tangible capital) and all such transactions are required to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank or subsidiary, as those provided to a nonaffiliate. With respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, they are limited to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of Section 23A and includes investment funds managed by an affiliate institution as well as other hurdles. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act expanded coverage of transactions with insiders by including credit exposure arising from derivative transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act furthermore prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing or selling an asset to an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder (or any related interest of such a person) unless the transaction is on market terms. If the transaction exceeds 10% of the institution’s capital, it must be approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested directors.

A bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and shareholders with greater than 10% ownership, as well as entities controlled by such persons, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals. The amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank’s capital position, and certain approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts.
 
Basel III and Sarbanes-Oxley Act
 
The Bank is also subject to capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules that implement the revised standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, commonly called Basel III, and address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III and the regulations of the federal banking agencies require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with certain capital standards. Compliance with these rules impose additional costs on the Company and the Bank.
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations, and corporate reporting requirements for companies with debt or equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Compliance with this complex legislation and subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission rules is a major focus of all public corporations and will be so for the Company going forward. One of the more applicable provisions of this act is corporate responsibility for financial reports. Sarbanes-Oxley requires a public company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer to sign quarterly and annual reports stating that they have reviewed the reports and that the reports are true.
 
Capital 
 
Developed by an international body known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, regulatory capital rules were released in July 2013 to implement capital standards (referred to as Basel III) and impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations, regardless of size, and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than $3 billion in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements are imposed on “advanced approaches” banking organizations which are organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted into the Basel III capital regime.
 
Banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Until a bank holding company’s assets reach $3 billion, the risk-based capital and leverage guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve are applied to bank holding companies on a nonconsolidated basis, unless the bank holding company is engaged in nonbank activities involving significant leverage, or it has a significant amount of outstanding debt held by the general public. Instead a bank holding company with less than $3 billion generally applies the risk-based capital and leverage capital guidelines on a bank only basis and must only meet a debt-to-equity ratio at the holding company level. The FDIC risk-based capital guidelines apply directly to insured state banks, regardless of whether they are subsidiaries of a bank holding company. Both agencies’ requirements, which are substantially similar, establish minimum capital ratios in relation to assets, both on an aggregate basis as adjusted for credit risks and off-balance sheet exposures. The risk weights assigned to assets are based primarily on credit risks. Depending upon the riskiness of a particular asset, it is assigned to a risk category. Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, risk weights (from 0% to 150%) are applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
 
Capital is then classified into three categories, Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, and Tier 2. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (“CET1”) is the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), and qualifying minority interests, less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions that include AOCI (if an irrevocable option to neutralize AOCI is exercised). Mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and investments in financial institutions are limited to an aggregate of 15% of CET1 and 10% of CET1 individually. Additional Tier 1 Capital includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Tier 1 minority interests, grandfathered trust preferred securities, and Troubled Asset Relief Program instruments, less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 2 Capital includes subordinated debt and preferred stock, total capital minority interests not included in Tier 1, and ALLL not exceeding 1.25% percent of risk-weighted assets, less applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.

Smaller banks, such as the Bank, are also subject to the following new capital level threshold requirements under the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action regulations.
 

 | Threshold Ratios
-------------------------------+-----------------
Capital Category | | Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio | Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio
Well capitalized | | 10% | 8% | 6.5% | 5% 
Adequately Capitalized | | 8% | 6% | 4.5% | 4% 
Undercapitalized | | < 8% | < 6% | < 4.5% | < 4% 
Significantly Undercapitalized | | < 6% | < 4% | < 3% | < 3% 
Critically Undercapitalized | | Tangible Equity/Total Assets ≤ 2%

 
Community banks are also subject to the following minimum capital requirements:
 

Minimum CET1 ratio | 4.5% 
--------------------------+------
Capital conversion buffer | 2.50%
Minimum tier 1 capital | 6.0% 
Minimum total capital | 8.0% 

 
Federal banking regulators’ risk-based capital guidelines also take account of interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the adverse effect that changes in market interest rates may have on a bank’s financial condition and is inherent to the business of banking. Under the regulations, when evaluating a bank’s capital adequacy, the capital standards explicitly include a bank’s exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates. The exposure of a bank’s economic value generally represents the change in the present value of its assets, less the change in the value of its liabilities, plus the change in the value of its interest rate off-balance sheet contracts.
 
Federal bank regulatory agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action as deemed appropriate for an insured depository institution and its holding company, based on the institution’s capital levels. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is considered “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly under-capitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, as an institution is deemed to be less well-capitalized, the scope and severity of the agencies’ powers increase, ultimately permitting the agency to appoint a receiver for the institution. Business activities may also be influenced by an institution’s capital classification. For instance, only a “well-capitalized” depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and can engage in various expansion activities with prior notice, rather than prior regulatory approval. However, rapid growth, poor loan portfolio performance or poor earnings performance, or a combination of these factors, could change the capital position of the Bank in a relatively short period of time. Failure to meet these capital requirements could subject the Bank to prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIC, which may include filing with the appropriate bank regulatory authorities a plan describing the means and a schedule for achieving the minimum capital requirements. In addition, we would not be able to receive regulatory approval of any application that required consideration of capital adequacy, such as a branch or merger application, unless we could demonstrate a reasonable plan to meet the capital requirement within an acceptable period of time.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was considered to be “well capitalized” with a 9.28% Tier 1 Leverage ratio; a 12.90% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio, a 12.90% Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio, and a 14.15% Total Risk-based Capital ratio.
 

Other Safety and Soundness Regulations
 
The federal banking agencies also have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation and benefits. The federal regulatory agencies may take action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.

Payment of Dividends
 
PMHG is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company’s principal sources of funds to pay dividends on its common stock are capital retained from stock offerings and dividends from the Bank. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Bank may pay to the Company without regulatory approval. The Federal Reserve Board is authorized to determine the circumstances when the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payments. The rights of the Company, its shareholders, and creditors, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank are also subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank. Additionally, the Florida Business Corporation Act provides that the Bank may only pay dividends if the dividend payment would not render the company insolvent, or unable to meet its obligations as they come due.
 
As a Florida state-chartered bank, the Bank is also subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, including a prohibition of dividend payments from the Bank’s capital under certain circumstances without the prior approval of the OFR and the FDIC. Except with the prior approval of the OFR, all dividends of any Florida bank must be paid out of retained net profits from the current period and the previous two years, after deducting expenses, including losses and bad debts.
 
Banks are also required to hold a capital conservation buffer of CET1 in excess of their minimum risk-based capital ratios to avoid limits on dividend payments and certain other bonus payments. Those requirements are reflected in the table below:
 

Capital Conservation Buffer (as a percentage of risk weighted assets) | Maximum Payout Ratio (as a % of the Previous Four Quarters of Net Income)
----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greater than 2.5% | No payout limitation 
Less than or equal to 2.5% and greater than 1.875% | 60% 
Less than or equal to 1.875% and greater than 1.25% | 40% 
Less than or equal to 1.25% and greater than 0.625% | 20% 
Less than or equal to 0.625% | 0% 

 
The Federal Reserve expects bank holding companies to serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary bank(s), which may require them to retain capital for investment in their subsidiary bank(s), rather than pay dividends to shareholders. As stated previously, the Bank may not pay dividends to PMHG, if after paying those dividends, the Bank would fail to meet the required minimum levels under the risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage ratio requirements. Payment of dividends by the Bank may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its applicable regulatory authorities, based upon the Bank’s capital position and asset quality.
 
Community Reinvestment
 
In connection with its lending activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”). The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency to assess the Bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the Bank, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance.” The Bank received a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent CRA evaluation. In addition, pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, federal banking regulators have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated third parties.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) as an agency to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection, including implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB has focused its rulemaking in several areas, particularly in the areas of mortgage reform involving the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Since 2013, the CFPB has accomplished several big changes including requiring lenders to verify borrowers’ income and ability to repay loans and simplifying the disclosures borrowers receive when taking out a loan.
 
Additional rulemakings to come under the Dodd-Frank Act will dictate compliance changes for financial institutions. Any such changes in regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Bank make it difficult to predict the ultimate effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
 
 12


Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws
 
Banking regulators intensely focus on Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements, particularly the Anti-Money Laundering provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by creating new laws, regulations, and penalties, imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report potential money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of its customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions.
Interstate Banking and Branching
 
Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without geographic limitation. Furthermore, national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. Florida law permits a state bank to establish a branch of the bank anywhere in the state. Accordingly, with the elimination of interstate branching under the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank with its headquarters outside the State of Florida may establish branches anywhere within Florida.
Economic and Monetary Policies
 
The Bank’s earnings are affected by the policies of various banking regulatory authorities of the United States, especially the Federal Reserve and FDIC. The Federal Reserve, among other things, regulates the supply of money, credit and interest rates as a means of influencing general economic conditions within the United States. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve for these purposes influence the overall level of investments, loans, other extensions of credit and deposits, and the interest rates paid on liabilities and received on assets.
 
As is generally true with all banking institutions, the Bank’s operations are materially and significantly influenced by these general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of financial institution regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Deposit flows and the cost of funds are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest. Lending activities are affected by the demand for real estate financing and other types of loans, which in turn, is affected by interest rates and other factors affecting local demand and availability of funds.
 
Enterprise Risk Management
 
As evidenced by many of the challenges that the financial industry has faced, we understand and place significant emphasis on risk management. We have invested resources in comprehensive software which monitors every component of the Bank. We believe that taking a global view of the Bank’s processes, down to the details of each procedure, will keep us properly focused. We recognize that enterprise risk management is an ongoing process.
 
Our solid asset quality statistics support our emphasis on risk management. With respect to lending, our risk management philosophy focuses on structuring credits to provide for multiple sources of repayment; this philosophy, coupled with strong underwriting policies and processes administered by experienced lenders, assists us with managing and mitigating our lending risks. As loans are reviewed, any borrowers who display deteriorating financial conditions are moved to an increased level of monitoring and a plan for implementing corrective actions is developed to minimize losses. We also have an annual independent, third-party loan review performed. In addition, our risk management software has the capability to stress test our portfolio utilizing mild and severe environments.
 
Our program also focuses on other specific areas of risk management including asset liability management, regulatory compliance, vendor management, policy review tracking, audit functions, and internal controls. Our asset liability management process is extensive; we use independent models by reputable third parties to run our interest rate risk model. We may utilize hedging techniques whenever our models indicate short term (net interest income) or long term (economic value of equity) risk to interest rate movements.
 
Our enterprise risk management program assists with monitoring operational controls and compliance control functions. We have also engaged an experienced independent public accounting firm to assist us with testing controls for operations and compliance. In addition, another experienced independent firm has been engaged to review and assess our controls with respect to technology and to perform penetration testing to assist us in managing the risks associated with information security.
 
Correspondent Banking 
 
Correspondent banking gives the Bank access to services that we have determined are not economical or practical to perform ourselves. We purchase correspondent services offered by larger banks, including check collections, purchase of federal funds, security safekeeping, investment services, coin and currency supplies. We may also use correspondent banks for overline and liquidity loan participations and sales of loan participations.

Interest and Usury 
 
The Bank is subject to numerous state and federal statutes that affect the interest rates that may be charged on loans. These laws do not, under present market conditions, deter the Bank from continuing to originate loans.
