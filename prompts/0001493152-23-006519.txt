Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Golden Royal Development Inc. (“Golden Royal”) was organized near the end of 2016 to engage in the business of purchasing and selling mineral leases and other interests in mineral rights. If Golden Royal is able to secure adequate financing, Golden Royal may also participate in drilling and/or mining operations. At present, Golden Royal’s cash resources are sufficient only to fund its ongoing operations. The operating assets that it now owns have been contributed by Jacob Roth, Golden Royal’s majority shareholder, or purchased with money contributed by Mr. Roth.
 
Oil and Gas Properties
 
On September 27, 2018, Jacob Roth assigned to Golden Royal all of the beneficial interest in two Wyoming oil and gas interests held in Jacob Roth’s name, and Golden Royal assumed responsibility for the expenses that accrue in relation to those interests. Specifically, the Assignment Agreement transfers to Golden Royal “all of the benefits that may accrue to (Jacob Roth) from ownership of the Interests, including any receipts of cash or distribution of assets, as well as the proceeds realized the on sale of either Interest, any of which shall be promptly transferred by Roth to Golden Royal upon receipt.” Conversely, Golden Royal assumed “responsibility for prompt payment of all fees, rents, taxes and any other financial liabilities as may accrue to Roth by reason of his record ownership of the Interests. The assignment and assumption will be effective until Jacob Roth ceases to be the record owner of the Interests.
 
The overriding royalty in the oil and gas lease on 320 acres of public lands in Converse County, Wyoming that Jacob Roth assigned to Golden Royal on September 27, 2018 terminated on September 1, 2020. Therefore, the oil and gas interest now owned beneficially by Golden Royal, by reason of the aforesaid Assignment Agreement, is:
 
Fremont County, WYW-185478. This is a ten-year mineral lease on 240 acres of public lands in Fremont County, Wyoming. The lease was granted to Jacob Roth by the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management, effective on February 1, 2017. The lease affords the lessee the exclusive right to drill for, remove and dispose of oil and gas (except helium) in the leased premises, which includes the right to build improvements necessary for the drilling operations. Jacob Roth paid a $415 filing fee to acquire the lease, and an annual rental fee of $360 is charged by the Bureau of Land Management. We do not know whether there is any drilling activity being conducted on lands in the vicinity of our leasehold.

On September 20, 2022, Golden Royal subscribed for two additional oil and gas leaseholds, one in Converse County, Wyoming, and one in Laramie County, Wyoming, which were approved in February 2023:
 
Converse County, Wyoming Lease 22-00255. This is a five-year oil and gas lease that will extend for an additional five-year term if oil and/or gas is being produced in profitable quantities. The leasehold is 80 acres of public lands in Converse County, Wyoming. The lease was granted to Golden Royal by the State of Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners effective on February 2, 2023. The lease affords the lessee the exclusive right to drill for, remove and dispose of oil and gas (including inert gases, sulfur, and helium) in the leased premises, which includes the right to build improvements necessary for the drilling operations. Golden Royal paid a $100 filing fee to acquire the lease, and an annual rental fee of $80 is charged by the State of Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments. We do not know whether there is any drilling activity being conducted on lands in the vicinity of our leasehold.
 
Laramie County, Wyoming Lease 22-00256. This is a five-year oil and gas lease that will extend for an additional five-year term if oil and/or gas is being produced in profitable quantities. The leasehold is 80 acres of public lands in Laramie County, Wyoming. The lease was granted to Golden Royal by the State of Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners effective on February 2, 2023. The lease affords the lessee the exclusive right to drill for, remove and dispose of oil and gas (including inert gases, sulfur, and helium) in the leased premises, which includes the right to build improvements necessary for the drilling operations. Golden Royal paid a $100 filing fee to acquire the lease, and an annual rental fee of $80 is charged by the State of Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments. We do not know whether there is any drilling activity being conducted on lands in the vicinity of our leasehold.
 
Precious Metal Interests
 
On December 6, 2018, Golden Royal and Jacob Roth entered into a second Assignment Agreement, which is identical to the September 27, 2018 Assignment Agreement except for the identity of the lease that is the subject of the agreement. The December 6, 2018 Assignment Agreement transfers to Golden Royal all of the beneficial interest in the following leasehold:
 
Crooks County, Wyoming Lease 0-43552. This is a ten-year lease granted to Jacob Roth on December 6, 2018 by the State of Wyoming in exchange for a $50 application fee and payment of a $640 annual license fee. The lease grants to Jacob Roth the right to prospect for, develop, produce and market such gold, silver and precious metals as may be found in 640 acres of public land located in Crooks County, Wyoming. We do not know whether there is any mining activity on land in the vicinity of our leasehold.
 
During the year ended September 31, 2022 Golden Royal purchased three additional precious metal leases in Crooks County, Wyoming:
 
Crooks County, Wyoming Lease 0-42778. Golden Royal purchased this ten-year lease from the State of Wyoming on November 8, 2021 in exchange for a $50 application fee and a commitment to pay $640 per year for five years and $1,280 per year during the next five years. The annual fee increases during any renewal terms. The lease grants to Golden Royal the right to prospect for, develop, produce and market gold, silver and precious metals, as well as diamonds, jade and precious stones that may be found in 640 acres of land located in Crooks County. We do not know whether there is any mining activity on land in the vicinity of our leasehold.

Crooks County, Wyoming Lease 0-42776. Golden Royal purchased this ten-year lease from the State of Wyoming on November 9, 2021 in exchange for a $50 application fee and a commitment to pay $160 per year for five years and $320 per year during the next five years. The annual fee increases during any renewal terms. The lease grants to Golden Royal the right to prospect for, develop, produce and market gold, silver and precious metals, as well as diamonds, jade and precious stones that may be found in 160 acres of land located in Crooks County. We do not know whether there is any mining activity on land in the vicinity of our leasehold.
 
Crooks County, Wyoming Lease 0-43639. Golden Royal purchased this ten-year lease from the State of Wyoming on March 28, 2022 in exchange for a $50 application fee and a commitment to pay $460 per year for five years and $919 per year during the next five years. The annual fee increases during any renewal terms. The lease grants to Golden Royal the right to prospect for, develop, produce and market gold, silver and precious metals, as well as diamonds, jade and precious stones that may be found in 459.55 acres of land located in Crooks County. We do not know whether there is any mining activity on land in the vicinity of our leasehold.
 
Currently, Golden Royal does not have the resources, personnel or infrastructure necessary to engage in oil and gas drilling or precious metal mining. Therefore, at the present time, Golden Royal is holding the four mineral interests described above, and plans to invest in additional mineral interests, as an investment with an eye towards resale. Our purpose in making these investments is to take advantage of increases in the value of the leaseholds that may occur. Such increases could be caused by higher global energy prices, new technologies that make exploration and drilling more cost efficient, or the emergence of markets for other resources located in the leased acreage. If any such circumstances, or any other causal factors, result in an increase in the market value of Golden Royal’s leaseholds, we will seek to negotiate a sale at a profit of the affected leasehold.
 
Our long-term plan is to develop a capability of participating in the development of oil and gas properties as well as of precious metal properties. We do not anticipate becoming an independent producer of oil, gas or precious metals. But we do plan to seek capital resources that will enable us to invest in drilling or mining activity carried on by established producers. Our plan is to offer our capital stock to investors in private or public offerings and obtain approximately $2.5 million in capital contributions. We believe that cash resources in that amount would enable us to participate as a significant investor in a number of drilling or mining programs sufficient to minimize the risk that all of our mineral investments will fail.
 
Proved Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenue
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission defines proved mineral reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, or precious metals that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e. prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions.
 
The process of estimating mineral reserves is complex and requires significant judgment. Our policies regarding booking reserves require proved reserves to be in compliance with the SEC definitions and guidance. Since none of our mineral properties is currently in production, we currently have no proved reserves.

Title to Properties
 
Title to mineral properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry or the precious metals industry, as applicable, liens for current taxes not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of our properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business.
 
As is customary in the minerals extraction industries, other than a preliminary review of local records, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties. Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties.
 
Competition
 
The market for mineral leases was substantially changed by the policies of the Trump Administration, and is now undergoing a reversal of many of those changes as a result of policies of the Biden administration. During the Trump Administration, the Department of the Interior dramatically increased the number of acres of public land that it made available for mineral leasing: during the 2018 fiscal year, for example, three times as much land was offered in auction as during the average of fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2016. Further, Interior Department regulations provide that if a parcel of mineral rights pass through auction without attracting a bid, then during the following two years anyone could purchase the rights with an upfront fee of $1.50 per acre. The combination of an increase in available land with the opportunity for purchase at negligible prices caused a marked reduction in the average price of mineral leases. In Montana, for example, the average lease price for oil and gas properties in 2018 was 20% of the average price in 2016.
 
The marked reduction in the price of mineral leases drew many more participants into the market, particularly speculative investors similar to Golden Royal. Many market participants speculated that the widespread protests against the post-auction “giveaways” would result in changes to regulations, which would lead to an increase in average lease prices. This activity created demand that, to some extent, offset the effect on lease prices of current Interior Department policies.
 
The Biden Administration has undertaken a reversal of the policies of the Trump Administration. In November 2021 the Department of the Interior published proposals to reduce the amount of land made available for extraction activities and to increase the fees charged for such activities. Then on April 15, 2022 the Department of the Interior published sales notices indicating an 80% reduction in the acreage being made available for leasing and a significant increase in the royalty rate payable to the government.
 
Implementation of Biden Administration policies is reducing the amount of land available for mineral extraction, and increasing the cost of such land. The State of Wyoming remains aggressive in its efforts to market mineral leases, but its efforts only partially offset the effect of federal policy, as the U.S. Bureau of Land Management holds the dominant position in mineral leasing in Wyoming. The competition that we will face in the coming years, therefore, will depend in large part on the competing policies of the U.S. Interior Department and the State of Wyoming .

Governmental Regulations, Approval, Compliance
 
If we elect to participate directly in development of oil and gas properties, our operations are or will be subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Such regulations includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells; implementing spill prevention plans; submitting notification and receiving permits relating to the presence, use and release of certain materials incidental to oil and gas operations; and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the use, transportation, storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities, surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production. Our operations are or will be also subject to various conservation matters, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or pro-ration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases, which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally limit the venting or flaring of gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we may be able to produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we may be able to drill.
 
If we elect to participate directly in mining the acreage on which we hold precious metal rights, we will primarily be restricted by federal and state environmental regulations, which significantly restrict the methods that can be employed in extracting precious metals, and require remediation of damage done to the environments in which we may mine. Such regulations will increase the cost of mining significantly, and accordingly reduce the profitability of our mining and, most significantly, our ability to attract investors to participate in any such mining activities.
 
Failure to comply with any laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations.
 
We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive an effect on our operations than on other similar companies in the energy industry. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to comply with federal and state environmental requirements.
 
Environmental
 
Operations on properties in which we have an interest are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws that regulate the discharge or disposal of materials or substances into the environment and otherwise are intended to protect the environment. Numerous governmental agencies issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and in some cases injunctive relief for failure to comply.
 
Some laws, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose “strict liability” for environmental contamination. These laws render a person or company liable for environmental and natural resource damages, cleanup costs and, in the case of oil spills in certain states, consequential damages without regard to negligence or fault. Other laws, rules and regulations may require the rate of oil and gas production to be below the economically optimal rate or may even prohibit exploration or production activities in environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, state laws often require some form of remedial action, such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells, to prevent pollution from former or suspended operations.

Legislation has been proposed in the past and continues to be evaluated in Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes and/or certain mining waste as “hazardous wastes.” This reclassification would make these wastes subject to much more stringent storage, treatment, disposal and clean-up requirements, which could have a significant adverse impact on operating costs. Initiatives to further regulate the disposal of oil and gas wastes and mining wastes are also proposed in certain states from time to time and may include initiatives at the county, municipal and local government levels. These various initiatives could have a similar adverse impact on operating costs.
 
The regulatory burden of environmental laws and regulations increases our cost and risk of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current or prior owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported, disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for the federal or state government to pursue such claims.
 
It is also not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury or property or natural resource damages allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Under CERCLA, certain oil and gas materials and products are, by definition, excluded from the term “hazardous substances.” A number of federal courts have held that certain wastes associated with the production of crude oil may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Although, under the federal Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, which governs the generation, treatment, storage and disposal of “solid wastes” and “hazardous wastes,” certain oil and gas materials and wastes are exempt from the definition of “hazardous wastes,” this exemption continues to be subject to judicial interpretation and increasingly stringent state interpretation. During the normal course of operations on properties in which we have an interest, exempt and non-exempt wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are subject to RCRA and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations may be generated.
 
We will rely on the operator of the properties in which we have an interest to be in substantial compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the control of emissions at all facilities on those properties. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. If we undertake drilling or mining operations, compliance with environmental requirements, including financial assurance requirements and the costs associated with the cleanup of any spill, could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 
Employees
 
It is anticipated that the only active employee of this business in the near future will be Jacob Roth, its President. All operative functions, such as acquiring or disposing of energy investments, will be handled by the President or independent contractors and consultants.
