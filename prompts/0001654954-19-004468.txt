  ITEM 1.  Business
  
 QuantRx Biomedical Corporation was incorporated on December 5, 1986, in the State of Nevada. The Company’s principal business office is located at 10190 SW 90th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97123.
  
  Overview
  
 We have developed and intend to commercialize our patented miniform pads (“PADs”) and PAD based over-the-counter products for the treatment of hemorrhoids, minor vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, general catamenial uses and other medical needs. We are also developing and intend to commercialize genomic diagnostics for the laboratory market, based on our lateral flow patents. Our platforms include: inSync®, UniqueTM, and OEM branded over-the-counter and laboratory testing products based on our core intellectual property related to our PAD technology.
  
 The continuation of our operations remains contingent upon the receipt of additional financing required to execute our business and operating plan, which is currently focused on the commercialization of our PAD technology either directly or through a joint venture or other relationship intended to increase shareholder value. In the interim, we have nominal operations, focused principally on maintaining our intellectual property portfolio and maintaining compliance with the public company reporting requirements. In order to continue as a going concern, we will need to raise capital, which may include through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. No assurances can be given that we will be able to obtain additional financing under terms favorable to us, if at all, or otherwise successfully develop a business and operating plan or enter into an alternative relationship to commercialize our PAD technology.
  
 Our principal business line consists of over-the-counter commercialization of our InSync feminine hygienic interlabial pad, the Unique® Miniform for hemorrhoid application, and other treated miniforms (the “OTC Business”), as well as maintaining established and continuing licensing relationships related to these products. We also own certain diagnostic testing technology (the “Diagnostic Business”) that is based on our lateral flow patents. Management believes this corporate structure permits us to more efficiently explore options to maximize the value of our products and intellectual property portfolio, with the objective of maximizing the value of the Businesses for the benefit of the Company and our shareholders.
  
 Our current focus is to obtain additional working capital necessary to continue as a going concern, and to develop a longer term financing and operating plan to: (i) commercialize our over-the-counter products either directly or through joint ventures, mergers or similar transactions intended to capitalize on potential commercial opportunities; (ii) contract manufacturing of our over-the-counter products to third parties while maintaining control over the manufacturing process; (iii) maintain our intellectual property portfolio with respect to patents and licenses pertaining to both the OTC Business and the Diagnostics Business; and (iv) maximize the value of our investments in non-core assets. As a result of our current financial condition, however, our efforts in the short-term will be focused on obtaining financing necessary to maintain the Company as a going concern.
  
  Preprogen Transaction
 
 On December 15, 2017 (“Closing Date”), we executed an agreement with Preprogen LLC (“Preprogen”) (the “Preprogen Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed to the sale, assignment, and license-back of certain of our assets pertaining to our Diagnostic Business (the “Purchased Assets”). Under this agreement, we retained all rights and assets relating to the OTC Business, which includes all assets necessary to pursue marketing the over-the-counter miniform products for female hygiene and hemorrhoid treatment.
  
 As set forth in the Preprogen Agreement, as consideration for the sale, assignment and transfer of the Purchased Assets (the “Preprogen Transaction”) on the Closing Date, Preprogen (A) paid us $1.0 million (“Cash Amount”) as follows: (i) approximately $38,000 was paid to the City of Portland to payoff certain indebtedness owed by us to the City of Portland, (ii) $65,000 in principal amount of notes held by Preprogen was credited toward the purchase price as a result of the cancellation and termination of those certain promissory notes payable to Preprogen by us, and (iii) the remaining balance was paid to us in cash at closing (the “Closing Balance”); and (B) issued to us that number of membership interests in Preprogen equal to 15% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Preprogen on a fully diluted basis as of the Closing Date. Under the terms of the Preprogen Agreement, Preprogen is obligated to pay to us such additional amounts calculated based on the aggregate gross revenue generated by Preprogen from the sale of products after the Closing Date that utilize, or royalty payments or licensing fees received by Preprogen with respect to, the Purchased Assets, if any, as more particularly set forth in the Preprogen Agreement.

 At closing, and as required by the Preprogen Agreement, we deposited $400,000 of the Cash Balance in escrow, which funds were to be used to fund up to 50% of the costs incurred by Preprogen in connection with the development and manufacturing of materials to be used by us for our over-the-counter miniform products and to be used by Preprogen for diagnostic products related to the Purchased Assets. As additional consideration for the Purchased Assets, we issued a warrant to Preprogen’s designee to purchase up to 15.0 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), at an exercise price of $0.05 per share (the “Warrant”). The Warrant is immediately exercisable and expires on December 14, 2022.
  
  On October 8, 2018, the Preprogen Agreement was amended to provide for, among other things, the release of funds held in escrow related to the manufacture of the miniform pads (the “Preprogen Amendment”), which resulted in both parties receiving $200,583 in cash. As consideration for the Preprogen Amendment, we agreed to pay Preprogen a royalty of 5% from the sale of all over-the-counter miniform products; provided, however, that such royalty payments shall terminate when Preprogen has received $200,000 in aggregate consideration from the royalties paid by us, and that we shall be entitled to offset such royalty payments due and payable to Preprogen by amounts equal to certain other payments otherwise due and payable to us by Preprogen pursuant to the terms of the Preprogen Agreement. At December 31, 2018, we revalued our investment in Preprogen to $222,000, recording an impairment of $278,000.
  
  Our Business
  
 Management’s objective is to develop our innovative PAD based products through genomic testing, although commercialization efforts are conditioned upon securing adequate financing. Assuming the availability of adequate working capital, our objective is to target significant market opportunities for our products through the following platforms.
 
  PAD/Health and Wellness 
  
 PAD products are based on our non-woven disposable absorbent pad technology, with products for aiding the treatment of hemorrhoids, minor vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, the over-the-counter catamenial markets, and other medical needs, including diagnostic sampling products that enable self-collection and worldwide transport for indications such as various cancers, premature delivery, and genomic testing.
  
  Lateral Flow Diagnostics
  
               Our Diagnostic Business is focused on the development RapidSense® point-of-care testing products and related oral fluid collection technologies based on our core intellectual property related to lateral flow methods, devices, and processes for the consumer and healthcare professional markets.
 Product and Product Candidates
  
 We have historically operated under a two-fold product development strategy: (i) maximize the value of internally developed products that are market-ready for near-term distribution, and (ii) aggressively develop technology platforms for products we believe will address medical diagnostic and treatment issues into the future.
  
 When introducing our PAD product lines and other products, we sought to align ourselves with experienced marketing partners that have established distribution channels. We teamed with a manufacturing partner in Asia, as well as niche United States manufacturers, in order to bring products to market in an efficient manner while controlling product quality. We currently do not have any manufacturing partnerships, as we are not currently manufacturing or selling any of our products; however, we are currently evaluating new manufacturing relationships in the U.S., consistent with the terms of the Preprogen Agreement.
  
 Our miniform PAD is a patented technology that provides the basis for a line of products that address an array of consumer health issues, including temporary relief of hemorrhoid and minor vaginal infection itch and discomfort, feminine urinary incontinence, catamenial needs, drug delivery, and medical sample collection and transport for diagnostic testing.
  
 Our PAD products for the consumer markets are designated as FDA Class I over-the-counter devices, and are easy to use, non-invasive, fully biodegradable, highly absorbent pads. Additionally, the unique non-woven technology utilized for the PADs allows for a PAD to be used as a sample collection device, providing a sample for diagnostic purposes, or to provide local or systemic therapy.

  Unique® Miniforms
  
 Miniform is a safe, convenient, and flushable technology for the underserved over-the-counter hemorrhoid, feminine hygiene and urinary incontinence markets. The disposable miniform pads contain no adhesives, require no insertion, and are small enough to fit in the palm of a hand.
  
 The Unique® miniform is available as a treated pad for the temporary relief of the itch and discomfort associated with hemorrhoids and minor vaginal infection, and as an untreated pad, for the daily protection of light urinary, vaginal or anal leakage.
  
 While we previously initiated a limited web-based domestic roll-out of the Unique® miniform, we are currently in search of a strategic partnership(s) to expand the retail availability of the product across the United States and internationally.
  
 We have significant experience manufacturing our miniform product and a clear understanding of its costs. The miniform technology is protected by numerous patents covering various applications, the manufacturing process, and certain materials. We previously contracted with a firm based in Taiwan to manufacture our PADs, although the manufacturing relationship is currently suspended due to our financial condition and pending the development of a financing and operation plan that allows us to re-commence active operations.
  
  Lateral Flow Diagnostics
  
 We developed and patented the RapidSense technology, a one-step lateral flow test with unique features such as a positive indication for a positive test, which allows us to target quantified point-of-care (“POC”) diagnostics previously limited to the diagnostic laboratory. These applications include, but are not limited to, thyroid disease, therapeutic drug monitoring, cancer diagnostics, diagnosis of cardiac disease, and other critical tests. This rapid POC diagnostic technology is ideal for testing any body fluid, including whole blood, serum, oral fluids and urine. We also patented innovative oral fluid collection devices specifically designed for our RapidSense technology. These distinctive collection devices, coupled with RapidSense and the reader platform, are intended to ultimately enable us to target the large and growing markets for diagnostics using oral sample collections, which have previously been limited to blood or urine testing.
 Competition
  
 Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and significant technological changes. Significant competitive factors in our industry include, among others, product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the government reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of products, the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity, manufacturing costs, intellectual property and patent rights and their protection, and sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.
  
 We face, and will continue to face, competition from organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions.
  
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop, which are cleared for sale by the FDA or similar international regulatory authorities in other countries, may compete with similar products currently available or that may become available in the future. Most of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources than we have, and greater capabilities and resources for research, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, marketing and sales. As a result, we may face competitive disadvantages relative to these organizations should they develop or commercialize a competitive product. In addition, given our current lack of working capital, our competitors will have the opportunity to capture market opportunities missed by us as we attempt to secure additional financing necessary to commercialize our products.
  
  Raw Materials and Manufacturing
  
 We currently do not have manufacturing capacity for any of our products, and therefore have historically contracted for the manufacturing of our products to third-party manufacturers, both in and outside the United States. All of our manufactured products have been, and at such time that we recommence active operations will be, produced under FDA mandated Good Manufacturing Practices standard operating procedures developed and controlled by our quality system, which specifies approved raw materials, vendors, and manufacturing methodology.

  Intellectual Property Rights and Patents
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we had nine (9) patents issued and five (5) licensed patents. Our issued patents expire between 2019 and 2030; however, we may obtain continuations, which would extend the rights granted under our issued patents, and additional patents to cover technology in development. We also have four (4) registered U.S. and foreign trademarks.
  
 Patents and other proprietary rights are an integral part of our business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions and also to rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, our patent positions involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our issued patents, those licensed to us, and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized, our relevant patent rights may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization. Expiration of patents we own or license could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and, consequently, our operating results and financial position.
  
  Licensing, Distribution and Development Agreements
  
 As noted above, on December 15, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Preprogen, which was subsequently amended on October 8, 2018, pursuant to which we agreed to the sale, assignment, and license-back of certain of our assets, including rights to use the intellectual property transferred to Preprogen necessary to the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of our OTC miniform products for the feminine hygiene and hemorrhoid treatment markets.
 Regulatory Requirements
  
 Some of our products and manufacturing activities are, or will be subject to regulation by the FDA, and by other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. Pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, commonly known as the FD&C Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the FDA regulates the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, promotion, advertising and sampling of medical devices and medical imaging products. Before a new device or pharmaceutical product can be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must generally obtain marketing clearance through a section 510(k) notification, a Premarket Approval (“PMA”) or a New Drug Approval (“NDA”).
  
 In the United States, medical devices intended for human use are classified into three categories, Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls deemed reasonably necessary by the FDA to assure their safety and effectiveness, with Class I requiring the fewest controls and Class III the most controls. Class I, unless exempted, and Class II devices are marketed following FDA clearance of a Section 510(k) premarket notification. Because Class III devices (e.g., a device whose failure could cause significant human harm or death) tend to carry the greatest risks, the manufacturer must demonstrate that such a device is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting a PMA application. PMA approval by the FDA is required before a Class III device can be lawfully marketed in the United States. Usually, the PMA process is significantly more time consuming and costly than the 510(k) process.
  
 The U.S. regulatory scheme for the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, which includes the targeted molecular imaging agents, can be divided into three distinct phases: an investigational phase including both preclinical and clinical investigations leading up to the submission of an NDA; a period of FDA review culminating in the approval or refusal to approve the NDA; and the post-marketing period.
  
 All of our over-the-counter products derived from the miniform technology, including Unique®, are currently classified as Class I – exempt devices, requiring written notification to the FDA before marketing.
  
 In addition, the FD&C Act requires device manufacturers to obtain a new FDA 510(k) clearance when there is a substantial change or modification in the intended use of a legally marketed device, or a change or modification, including product enhancements, changes to packaging or advertising text and, in some cases, manufacturing changes, to a legally marketed device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness. Supplements for approved PMA devices are required for device changes, including some manufacturing changes that affect safety or effectiveness, or disclosure to the consumer, such as labeling. For devices marketed pursuant to 510(k) determinations of substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must obtain FDA clearance of a new 510(k) notification prior to marketing the modified device. For devices marketed with PMA, the manufacturer must obtain FDA approval of a supplement to the PMA prior to marketing the modified device. Such regulatory requirements may require us to retain records for up to seven years, and to be subject to periodic regulatory review and inspection of all facilities and documents by the FDA.

 The FD&C Act requires device manufacturers to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. The regulations require that medical device manufacturers comply with various quality control requirements pertaining to design controls, purchasing contracts, organization and personnel, including device and manufacturing process design, buildings, environmental control, cleaning and sanitation; equipment and calibration of equipment; medical device components; manufacturing specifications and processes; reprocessing of devices; labeling and packaging; in-process and finished device inspection and acceptance; device failure investigations; and record keeping requirements including complaint files and device tracking. At such time that we re-commence operations, if ever, Company personnel and non-affiliated contract auditors will periodically inspect the contract manufacturers to assure they remain in compliance.
  
 Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) regulates all laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the U.S. pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”). In total, CLIA covers approximately 225,000 laboratory entities. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Office of Clinical Standards and Quality (“OCSQ”) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA Program.
  
 The objective of the CLIA program is to ensure quality laboratory testing. Although all clinical laboratories must be properly certified to receive Medicare or Medicaid payments, CLIA has no direct Medicare or Medicaid program responsibilities. In the event our current operating plan includes such a facility, we will fall under CLIA regulatory requirements.
  
 Certain of our product candidates will require significant clinical validation prior to obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA. We intend to contract with appropriate and experienced CROs (contract research organizations) to prepare for and review the results from clinical field trials. We engage certain scientific advisors, consisting of scientific Ph.D.s and M.D.’s, who contribute to the scientific and medical validity of our clinical trials when appropriate.
  
  Research and Development Activities
  
 We did not engage in any research and development efforts during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, nor do we expect to engage in any research and development activity until funding is secured and we develop a plan to commercialize our products.
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we had no employees; however, we have four part-time consultants providing services to the Company in order to maintain the Company as a going concern and to protect our intellectual property portfolio and other assets.
