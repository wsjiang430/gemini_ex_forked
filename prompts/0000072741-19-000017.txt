Please refer to the Glossary of Terms for definitions of defined terms and abbreviations used in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Eversource Energy, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, is a public utility holding company subject to regulation by the FERC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. We are engaged primarily in the energy delivery business through the following wholly-owned utility subsidiaries:

• | The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut;


• | NSTAR Electric Company (NSTAR Electric), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of eastern and western Massachusetts and owns solar power facilities;


• | Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of New Hampshire;


• | NSTAR Gas Company (NSTAR Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;


• | Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut; and


• | Eversource Aquarion Holdings, Inc. (Aquarion), a utility holding company that owns three separate regulated water utility subsidiaries and collectively serves residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection customers in parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. On December 4, 2017, Eversource acquired Eversource Aquarion Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (formerly known as Macquarie Utilities Inc). 

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH also serve New England customers through Eversource Energy's electric transmission business. Along with NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, each is doing business as Eversource Energy in its respective service territory. 
Eversource Energy, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each report their financial results separately. We also include information in this report on a segment basis for Eversource Energy. Eversource Energy has four reportable segments: electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution and water distribution. These segments represent substantially all of Eversource Energy's total consolidated revenues. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH do not report separate business segments. 
ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT
Eversource Energy's electric distribution segment consists of the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, which are engaged in the distribution of electricity to retail customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively, and the solar power facilities of NSTAR Electric, and the generation facilities of PSNH before such facilities were sold in January and August 2018.
ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – CONNECTICUT – THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY
CL&P's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2018, CL&P furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.25 million customers in 149 cities and towns in Connecticut, covering an area of 4,400 square miles. CL&P does not own any electric generation facilities.
Rates
CL&P is subject to regulation by the PURA, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities. CL&P's present general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services. CL&P's retail rates include a delivery service component, which includes distribution, transmission, conservation, renewable energy programs and other charges that are assessed on all customers.
2

Under Connecticut law, all of CL&P's customers are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while CL&P remains their electric distribution company. For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, under SS rates for customers with less than 500 kilowatts of demand (residential customers and small and medium commercial and industrial customers), and LRS rates for customers with 500 kilowatts or more of demand (larger commercial and industrial customers), CL&P purchases power under standard offer contracts and passes the cost of the purchased power to customers through a combined charge on customers' bills.
The rates established by the PURA for CL&P are comprised of the following:

• | An electric GSC, which recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers. The GSC is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | A revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the PURA of approximately $1.1 billion, effective May 1, 2018 and May 1, 2019, and $1.2 billion, effective May 1, 2020. These pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement are also subject to adjustment at each of these dates in accordance with provisions of the April 2018 rate case settlement agreement described below. 


• | A distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers, as well as ongoing operating costs to maintain the infrastructure.


• | An Electric System Improvements (ESI) charge, which collects the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers above the level recovered through the distribution charge. The ESI also recovers costs associated with CL&P’s system resiliency program. The ESI is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | An FMCC, which recovers any costs imposed by the FERC as part of the New England Standard Market Design, including locational marginal pricing, locational installed capacity payments, and any costs approved by the PURA to reduce these charges. The FMCC has both a bypassable component and a non-bypassable component, and is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The transmission charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | A CTA charge, assessed to recover stranded costs associated with electric industry restructuring such as various IPP contracts. The CTA is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | An SBC, established to fund expenses associated with various hardship and low-income programs. The SBC is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | A Renewable Energy Investment Charge, which is used to promote investment in renewable energy sources. Amounts collected by this charge are deposited into the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund and administered by the Connecticut Green Bank. 


• | A conservation charge, comprised of both a statutory rate and Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) established to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs and market transformation initiatives. The conservation charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers through an approved adjustment to the following year’s energy conservation spending plan budget.

As required by regulation, CL&P, jointly with UI, entered into the following contracts whereby UI will share 20 percent and CL&P will share 80 percent of the costs and benefits (CL&P's portion of these costs are either recovered from, or refunded to, customers through the FMCC):

• | Four capacity CfDs (totaling approximately 787 MW of capacity) with three electric generation units and one demand response project, which extend through 2026 and have terms of up to 15 years beginning in 2009. The capacity CfDs obligate both CL&P and UI to make or receive payments on a monthly basis to or from the project and generation owners based on the difference between a contractually set capacity price and the capacity market prices that the project and generation owners receive in the ISO-NE capacity markets. 


• | Three peaker CfDs (totaling approximately 500 MW of peaking capacity) with three peaking generation units. The three peaker CfDs pay the generation owners the difference between capacity, forward reserve and energy market revenues and a cost-of-service payment stream for 30 years beginning in 2008 (including costs of plant operation and the prices that the generation owners receive for capacity and other products in the ISO-NE markets).

Distribution Rate Case: CL&P's distribution rates were established in an April 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective May 1, 2018. For further information, see "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Sources and Availability of Electric Power Supply
As noted above, CL&P does not own any generation assets and purchases energy supply to serve its SS and LRS loads from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals. During 2018, CL&P supplied approximately 45 percent of its customer load at SS or LRS rates while the other 55 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers. In terms of the total number of CL&P customers, this equates to 28 percent being on competitive supply, while 72 percent remain with SS or LRS. Because this customer migration is only for energy supply service, it has no impact on CL&P's electric distribution business or its operating income.
CL&P periodically enters into full requirements contracts for SS loads for periods of up to one year. CL&P typically enters into full requirements contracts for LRS loads every three months. Currently, CL&P has full requirements contracts in place for 100 percent of its SS loads for the first half of 2019. For the second half of 2019, CL&P has 70 percent of its SS load under full requirements contracts and intends to purchase an additional 30 percent of full requirements. None of the SS load for 2020 has been procured. CL&P has full requirements contracts in place for its LRS loads through June 2019 and intends to purchase 100 percent of full requirements for the remainder of 2019.
ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – MASSACHUSETTS – NSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY
NSTAR Electric's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2018, NSTAR Electric furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.47 million customers in Boston and 139 cities and towns in eastern and western Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and the greater Springfield metropolitan area, covering an aggregate area of approximately 3,200 square miles. NSTAR Electric does not own any generating facilities used to supply customers and purchases its energy requirements from competitive energy suppliers.
In December 2016, the DPU approved NSTAR Electric's application to develop 62 MW of new solar power facilities in addition to the 8 MW of existing solar power facilities. Currently, NSTAR Electric owns 58 MW of solar power facilities on sites in Massachusetts that were completed from 2010 through 2018. We expect the remaining 4 MW of new facilities to be completed in 2019. Similar to NSTAR Electric’s current practice on the existing 58 MW of solar power facilities, we expect that NSTAR Electric will sell energy from the new facilities into the ISO-NE market. We estimate our investment in these new facilities will be approximately $170 million. 
Rates
NSTAR Electric is subject to regulation by the DPU, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, acquisition of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities. The present general rate structure for NSTAR Electric consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services.
Under Massachusetts law, all customers of NSTAR Electric are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while NSTAR Electric remains their electric distribution company. NSTAR Electric purchases power from competitive suppliers on behalf of, and passes the related cost through to, its customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier (basic service). Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through basic service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. Most of the residential customers of NSTAR Electric have continued to buy their power from NSTAR Electric at basic service rates. Most commercial and industrial customers have switched to a competitive energy supplier.
The Cape Light Compact, an inter-governmental organization consisting of the 21 towns and two counties on Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard, serves 200,000 customers through the delivery of energy efficiency programs, consumer advocacy, competitive electricity supply and green power options. NSTAR Electric continues to provide electric service to these customers including the delivery of power, maintenance of infrastructure, capital investment, meter reading, billing, and customer service.
The rates established by the DPU for NSTAR Electric are comprised of the following:

• | A basic service charge that represents the collection of energy costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers, including costs related to charge-offs of uncollectible energy costs from customers. Basic service rates are reset every six months (every three months for large commercial and industrial customers). Additionally, the DPU has authorized NSTAR Electric to recover the cost of its NSTAR Green wind contracts through the basic service charge. Basic service costs are reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | A distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the distribution infrastructure to deliver electricity to its destination, as well as ongoing operating costs.


• | A revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU of approximately $956 million on an annualized basis for 2018. Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric operated entirely under a decoupled rate structure. Annual 

4

base distribution amounts are adjusted for inflation and filed for approval by the DPU on an annual basis, until the next rate case. The baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU for 2019 is $988 million. 

• | A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The transmission charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | A transition charge that represents costs to be collected primarily from previously held investments in generating plants, costs related to existing above-market power contracts, and contract costs related to long-term power contract buy-outs. The transition charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.


• | A renewable energy charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to support the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Trust Fund.


• | An energy efficiency charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to collect costs for energy efficiency programs. The energy efficiency charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 


• | Reconciling adjustment charges that recover certain DPU-approved costs, including pension and PBOP benefits, low income customer discounts, credits issued to net-metering facilities installed by customers, payments to solar facilities qualified under the state solar renewable energy target program, attorney general consultant expenses, long-term renewable contracts, company owned solar facilities, vegetation management costs, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and storm restoration. These charges are reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. 

As required by regulation, NSTAR Electric, along with two other Massachusetts electric utilities, signed long-term commitments to purchase a combined estimated generating capacity of approximately 101 MW of wind and solar power from one wind farm in New York (28 MW), and nine solar projects in Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Rhode Island (73 MW), over 20 years. One solar project began operating in January 2019, and the other eight solar projects are scheduled to begin operating in late 2019. In addition, the one wind farm in New York is scheduled to begin operating by year end 2020.
Distribution Rate Case: NSTAR Electric's distribution rates were established in a 2017 DPU-approved rate case with rates effective February 1, 2018. For further information, see "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Service Quality Metrics: NSTAR Electric is subject to service quality ("SQ") metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service, and could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual transmission and distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics. NSTAR Electric will not be required to pay a SQ charge for its 2018 performance as the company achieved results at or above target for all of its SQ metrics in 2018.
Sources and Availability of Electric Power Supply
As noted above, NSTAR Electric does not own any generation assets (other than solar power facilities) and purchases its energy requirements from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals issued periodically, consistent with DPU regulations. NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for 48 percent of its residential and small commercial and industrial ("C&I") customers twice per year for twelve-month terms. NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for 18 percent of large C&I customers every three months.
During 2018, NSTAR Electric supplied approximately 55 percent of its residential customer load, 33 percent of its small C&I customer load, and 8 percent of its large C&I customer load at basic service rates. The remainder of its customer load was distributed between municipal aggregation and competitive supply. Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on the delivery business or operating income of NSTAR Electric.
ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – NEW HAMPSHIRE – PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
PSNH's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2018, PSNH furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 519,000 retail customers in 211 cities and towns in New Hampshire, covering an area of approximately 5,630 square miles.
On January 10, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its thermal generation assets pursuant to a 2017 purchase and sale agreement. The thermal generation facilities included approximately 1,100 MW of coal, natural gas, biomass and oil-fired electricity generation facilities. On August 26, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets pursuant to a separate 2017 purchase and sale agreement. For further information, see "Generation Divestiture" below. As of December 31, 2018, PSNH does not own any electric generation facilities.

Rates
PSNH is subject to regulation by the NHPUC, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.
Under New Hampshire law, all of PSNH's customers are entitled to choose competitive energy suppliers. During 2018, approximately 24 percent of all of PSNH's customers (approximately 56 percent of load) were taking service from competitive energy suppliers.
The rates established by the NHPUC for PSNH are comprised of the following:

• | A default energy service charge recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers. Through March 31, 2018, the default energy service charge recovered the costs of PSNH's generation, as well as purchased power, and included an allowed ROE of 9.81 percent. Effective April 1, 2018, as a result of the completion of the divestiture of its non-hydro generation assets, PSNH purchased power for retail customers who had not chosen a competitive supplier through a periodic market solicitation with the rate set to recover the cost of that power, statutorily mandated renewable portfolio standard costs and the continued cost associated with the ownership of the Hydro generation units until the completion of the divestiture of the hydro units in August 2018. Effective September 1, 2018, any remaining costs from ownership of generation are recovered as part of the SCRC described below.


• | A distribution charge, which includes kilowatt-hour and/or demand-based charges to recover costs related to the maintenance and operation of PSNH's infrastructure to deliver power to its destination, as well as power restoration and service costs. It also includes a customer charge to collect the cost of providing service to a customer; such as the installation, maintenance, reading and replacement of meters and maintaining accounts and records. 


• | A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.


• | An SCRC, which allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs, including above-market expenses incurred under mandated power purchase obligations, other long-term investments and obligations, and the remaining costs associated with the 2018 sales of its generation facilities.


• | An SBC, which funds energy efficiency programs for all customers, as well as assistance programs for residential customers within certain income guidelines.

The default energy service charge and SCRC rates change semi-annually and the transmission and SBC rates change annually. These rates are reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.
PSNH distribution rates were established in a settlement approved by the NHPUC in 2010. Prior to the expiration of that settlement on June 30, 2015, the NHPUC approved the continuation of those rates, and increased funding via rates, of PSNH's reliability enhancement program.
Generation Divestiture
In June 2015, Eversource and PSNH entered into the 2015 Public Service Company of New Hampshire Restructuring and Rate Stabilization Agreement, pursuant to which PSNH agreed to divest its generation assets, subject to NHPUC approval. The NHPUC approved this agreement as well as the final divestiture plan and auction process in 2016. On October 11, 2017, PSNH entered into two Purchase and Sale Agreements with private investors, one to sell its thermal generation assets at a purchase price of $175 million, subject to adjustment, (the “Thermal Agreement”) and a second to sell its hydroelectric generation assets at a purchase price of $83 million, subject to adjustment (the “Hydro Agreement”). The NHPUC approved these agreements in late November 2017, at which time the Company classified these assets as held for sale. 
On January 10, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its thermal generation assets pursuant to the Thermal Agreement. In accordance with the Thermal Agreement, the original purchase price of $175 million was adjusted to reflect working capital adjustments, closing date adjustments and proration of taxes and fees prior to closing, totaling $40.9 million. In the second quarter of 2018, the purchase price was further adjusted by $17.3 million relating to the valuation of certain allowances. As a result of these adjustments, net proceeds from the sale of the thermal assets totaled $116.8 million. 
On July 16, 2018, FERC issued its order approving the transfer of PSNH's six hydroelectric licenses to private investors. On August 26, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets pursuant to the Hydro Agreement. In accordance with the Hydro Agreement, the original purchase price of $83 million was adjusted to reflect contractual adjustments totaling $5.8 million, resulting in net proceeds of $77.2 million. The difference between the carrying value of the hydroelectric generation assets and the sale proceeds resulted in a gain of $17.3 million. An estimated gain from the sale of these assets was included as an offset to the total remaining costs associated with the sale of generation assets that were securitized on May 8, 2018.
6

On May 8, 2018, PSNH Funding issued $635.7 million of securitized RRBs pursuant to a finance order issued by the NHPUC on January 30, 2018 to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of PSNH’s generation assets.  These RRBs are secured by a non-bypassable charge recoverable from PSNH customers. PSNH recorded regulatory assets and other deferred costs in connection with the generation asset divestiture and the securitization of remaining costs, which are probable of recovery through collection of the non-bypassable charge. For further information on the securitized RRB issuance, see "Liquidity - Rate Reduction Bonds" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Sources and Availability of Electric Power Supply
From January 1, 2018 through March 31, 2018, approximately 24 percent of PSNH's default energy service load was met through its own generation and approximately 18 percent was met through long-term power supply provided pursuant to orders of the NHPUC. The remaining 58 percent of PSNH's load was met by short-term (less than one year) purchases and spot purchases in the competitive New England wholesale power market. Included in the 58 percent are PSNH's obligations to purchase power from approximately two dozen IPPs, the output of which it either uses to serve its customer load or sells into the ISO-NE market. Beginning on April 1, 2018, 100 percent of PSNH’s default energy service load was met through purchases of energy requirements from competitive sources through requests for proposals issued periodically, consistent with NHPUC regulations.
PSNH no longer owns any generation assets and enters into supply contracts for energy service twice per year for six-month terms for 76 percent of its residential and small commercial and industrial ("C&I") customers and for 15 percent of its large C&I customers.
During 2018, PSNH supplied approximately 42 percent of its customer load at default energy service rates while the other 58 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers. Because this customer migration is only for energy supply service, it has no impact on PSNH’s electric distribution business or its operating income.
ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT
Each of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH owns and maintains transmission facilities that are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which electricity is transmitted throughout New England. Each of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and most other New England utilities, are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's transmission facilities and the rules by which they acquire transmission services. Under these arrangements, ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of directors and staff are independent of all market participants, serves as the regional transmission organization of the New England transmission system. 
Wholesale Transmission Rates
Wholesale transmission revenues are recovered through FERC-approved formula rates. Annual transmission revenue requirements include recovery of transmission costs and include a return on equity applied to transmission rate base. Transmission revenues are collected from New England customers, including distribution customers of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. The transmission rates provide for an annual true-up of estimated to actual costs. The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refunded to, transmission customers.
FERC ROE Complaints
Four separate complaints have been filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively the "Complainants"). In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15-month complaint periods. In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive ("incentive cap") of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable. 
In response to appeals of the FERC decision in the first complaint filed by the NETOs and the Complainants, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision on April 14, 2017 vacating and remanding the FERC's decision. On October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court. FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE. For further information, see "FERC Regulatory Matters - FERC ROE Complaints" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Transmission Projects
During 2018, we were involved in the planning, development and construction of a series of electric transmission projects, including the Greater Hartford Central Connecticut projects ("GHCC") and the Greater Boston Reliability Solutions, that will be built within the next three years and that will enhance system reliability and improve capacity. We were also involved in the planning and development of the Seacoast Reliability Project, for which the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee ("NHSEC") indicated its unanimous approval of the project on December 10, 2018, and subsequently issued its written decision on January 31, 2019. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019.
7

In March 2018, the NHSEC issued a written decision denying Northern Pass’ siting application after which the Massachusetts EDCs terminated the selection of, and subsequent contract negotiations with, Northern Pass under the Massachusetts Clean Energy RFP. On April 27, 2018, NPT filed a motion for rehearing with the NHSEC and on July 12, 2018, the NHSEC issued its written decision denying Northern Pass’ motion for rehearing. On August 10, 2018, NPT filed an appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, alleging that the NHSEC failed to follow applicable law in its review of the project. On October 12, 2018, the New Hampshire Supreme Court accepted this appeal. Subsequently, the NHSEC transmitted the record of its proceedings to the New Hampshire Supreme Court on December 11, 2018. Briefing of the appeal began on February 4, 2019. The New Hampshire Supreme Court has not set a date for oral argument. NPT intends to continue to pursue NHSEC approval to construct this project.  Consistent with Eversource’s and HQ’s long-term relationship to bring clean energy into New England, Eversource and HQ remain committed to Northern Pass and the many benefits this project will bring to our customers and the region. For further information, see "Business Development and Capital Expenditures - Electric Transmission Business" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Transmission Rate Base
Transmission rate base under our FERC-approved tariff primarily consists of our investment in transmission net utility plant less accumulated deferred income taxes. 
Under our FERC-approved tariff, and with the exception of transmission projects that received specific FERC approval to include CWIP in rate base, transmission projects generally enter rate base after they are placed in commercial operation. At the end of 2018, our estimated transmission rate base was approximately $6.7 billion, including approximately $3.0 billion at CL&P, $2.7 billion at NSTAR Electric, and $920 million at PSNH.
NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT
NSTAR Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 296,000 customers in 51 communities in central and eastern Massachusetts covering 1,067 square miles, and Yankee Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 237,000 customers in 72 cities and towns in Connecticut covering 2,187 square miles. Total throughput (sales and transportation) in 2018 was approximately 70.1 Bcf for NSTAR Gas and 58.6 Bcf for Yankee Gas. Our natural gas businesses provide firm natural gas sales and transportation service to eligible retail customers who require a continuous natural gas supply throughout the year, such as residential customers who rely on natural gas for heating, hot water and cooking needs, as well as commercial and industrial customers that rely on natural gas for space heating, hot water, cooking and commercial and industrial applications. 
A portion of the storage of natural gas supply for NSTAR Gas during the winter heating season is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource Energy. NSTAR Gas has access to Hopkinton LNG Corp. facilities in Hopkinton, Massachusetts consisting of a LNG liquefaction and vaporization plant and three above-ground cryogenic storage tanks having an aggregate capacity of 3.0 Bcf of liquefied natural gas. NSTAR Gas also has access to Hopkinton LNG Corp. facilities in Acushnet, Massachusetts that include additional storage capacity of 0.5 Bcf. Total vaporization capacity of these facilities is 0.21 Bcf per day. Yankee Gas owns a 1.2 Bcf LNG facility in Waterbury, Connecticut, which also has the ability to liquefy and vaporize up to 0.1 Bcf per day. This facility is used primarily to assist Yankee Gas in meeting its supplier-of-last-resort obligations and also enables it to provide economic supply and make economic refill of natural gas, typically during periods of low demand.
NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas generate revenues primarily through the sale and/or transportation of natural gas. While all NSTAR Gas customers have the ability to choose to transport natural gas, in the past year, transportation represented only about two percent of the total residential load, while transportation represented about 56 percent of the total commercial and industrial load. Retail natural gas service in Connecticut is partially unbundled: residential customers in Yankee Gas' service territory buy natural gas supply and delivery only from Yankee Gas while commercial and industrial customers may choose their natural gas suppliers. NSTAR Gas offers firm transportation service to all customers who purchase natural gas from sources other than NSTAR Gas while Yankee Gas offers firm transportation service to its commercial and industrial customers who purchase natural gas from sources other than Yankee Gas. NSTAR Gas offers interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to high volume commercial and industrial customers. Yankee Gas offers interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to commercial and industrial customers that have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel on short notice. NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas can interrupt service to these customers during peak demand periods or at any other time to maintain distribution system integrity. 
Rates
NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas are subject to regulation by the DPU and the PURA, respectively, which, among other things, have jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.
Retail natural gas delivery and supply rates are established by the DPU and the PURA and are comprised of:

• | A distribution charge consisting of a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge that collects the costs of building, maintaining, and expanding the natural gas infrastructure to deliver natural gas supply to its customers. This also includes collection of ongoing operating costs. 


• | A seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause ("CGAC") at NSTAR Gas that collects natural gas supply costs, pipeline and storage capacity costs, costs related to charge-offs of uncollected energy costs and working capital related costs. The CGAC is reset semi-annually 

8

with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following corresponding season. In addition, NSTAR Gas files interim changes to its CGAC factor when the actual costs of natural gas supply vary from projections by more than five percent.

• | A local distribution adjustment clause ("LDAC") at NSTAR Gas that collects all energy efficiency and related program costs, environmental costs, pension and PBOP related costs, attorney general consultant costs, and costs associated with low income customers. The LDAC is reset annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following period and provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers. 


• | A Purchased Gas Adjustment ("PGA") clause, which is evaluated monthly and allows Yankee Gas to recover the costs of the procurement of natural gas for its firm and seasonal customers. Differences between actual natural gas costs and collection amounts on August 31st of each year are deferred and then recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following year. Carrying charges on outstanding balances are calculated using Yankee Gas' weighted average cost of capital in accordance with the directives of the PURA. 


• | Conservation Adjustment Mechanism ("CAM") at Yankee Gas, which allows 100 percent recovery of conservation costs through this mechanism including program incentives to promote energy efficiency, as well as recovery of any lost revenues associated with implementation of energy conservation measures. A reconciliation of CAM revenues to expenses is performed annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers with carrying charges during the following year. 

NSTAR Gas purchases financial contracts based on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") natural gas futures in order to reduce cash flow variability associated with the price for approximately one-third of its normal winter season natural gas supplies. These purchases are made under a program approved by the DPU in 2006. This practice attempts to minimize the impact of fluctuations in natural gas prices to NSTAR Gas' firm natural gas customers. These financial contracts do not procure natural gas supply. All costs incurred or benefits realized when these contracts are settled are included in the CGAC.
NSTAR Gas is subject to SQ metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service and could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics. NSTAR Gas will not be required to pay a SQ charge for its 2018 performance as it achieved results at or above target for all of its SQ metrics in 2018.
NSTAR Gas distribution rates were set in its 2015 DPU approved rate case. Yankee Gas distribution rates were set in a December 2018 PURA approved rate case settlement agreement, with rates effective November 15, 2018.
The 2018 Yankee Gas settlement agreement required Yankee Gas to implement a Distribution Integrity Management Program ("DIMP") cost recovery mechanism to further invest capital to replace aging infrastructure. The DIMP mechanism allows for recovery of costs associated with capital additions of approximately $26 million to $37 million annually, which is incremental to the $150 million included in base distribution rate base per year. The settlement agreement also provides Yankee Gas the opportunity to seek recovery of additional capital spending above these levels with PURA approval. PURA ordered an accelerated replacement program for Yankee Gas to fully replace its cast iron and bare steel facilities in 11 years and fully replace copper services and certain steel mains and services in 14 years. Yankee Gas was also authorized to continue its ongoing natural gas system expansion program, implement a revenue decoupling rate mechanism, and recover merger costs. The settlement agreement included a regulatory ROE of 9.3 percent. In addition, the distribution rates charged to customers were adjusted to reflect the prospective impacts of the lower federal corporate income tax rate, the overcollection of the lower income tax rate from January 1, 2018, and the EDIT from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Although new rates were effective January 1, 2019, the provisions of the settlement agreement took effect November 15, 2018. For further information on the 2018 Yankee Gas settlement agreement, see "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Natural Gas Replacement and Expansion
Massachusetts: On July 7, 2014, Massachusetts enacted "An Act Relative to Natural Gas Leaks". This act established a uniform natural gas leak classification standard for all Massachusetts natural gas utilities and a program that accelerates the replacement of aging natural gas infrastructure. The program enabled companies, including NSTAR Gas, to better manage the scheduling and costs of replacement. The act also called for the DPU to authorize natural gas utilities to design and offer programs to customers that will increase the availability, affordability and feasibility of natural gas service for new customers.
In October of each year, pursuant to the act, NSTAR Gas files the Gas System Enhancement Program ("GSEP") with the DPU for the following construction year. NSTAR Gas' program accelerates the replacement of certain natural gas distribution facilities in the system to less than 25 years. The GSEP includes a tariff that provides NSTAR Gas an opportunity to collect the costs for the program on an annual basis through a reconciling factor. On April 30th each year, the DPU approves the GSEP rate recovery factor that goes into effect on May 1st.
Connecticut: In 2013, in accordance with Connecticut law and regulations, the PURA approved a comprehensive joint natural gas infrastructure expansion plan (the "Expansion Plan") filed by Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies. In January 2015, the PURA approved a joint settlement agreement proposed by Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies and regulatory agencies that clarified the procedures and oversight criteria applicable to the Expansion Plan. Yankee Gas has received approval from PURA for its 2014, 2015 and 2016 System Expansion Reconciliations as of November 2017. Yankee Gas filed its 2017 System Expansion Reconciliation in March 2018 and is awaiting PURA review. Yankee Gas intends to file its 2018 System Expansion Reconciliation on March 15, 2019.

Sources and Availability of Natural Gas Supply
NSTAR Gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market area storage and peaking services. NSTAR Gas purchases transportation, storage, and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions in the U.S., including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent region, and Appalachian Shale supplies to the final delivery points in the NSTAR Gas service area. NSTAR Gas purchases all of its natural gas supply under a firm, competitively bid annual portfolio management contract. In addition to the firm transportation and natural gas storage supplies discussed above, NSTAR Gas utilizes on-system LNG facilities to meet its winter peaking demands. These LNG facilities, described below, are located within NSTAR Gas' distribution system and are used to liquefy and store pipeline natural gas during the warmer months for vaporization and use during the heating season. During the summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity and supplies are used to deliver and store natural gas in market area underground storage facilities located in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Stored natural gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement flowing pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating demand. NSTAR Gas has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of approximately 6.6 Bcf, of which 3.5 Bcf LNG storage is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp. in facilities located in Hopkinton and Acushnet, MA. 
The PURA requires Yankee Gas to meet the needs of its firm customers under all weather conditions. Specifically, Yankee Gas must structure its supply portfolio to meet firm customer needs under a design day scenario (defined as the coldest day in 30 years) and under a design year scenario (defined as the average of the four coldest years in the last 30 years). Yankee Gas also maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, off-system storage and its on-system 1.2 Bcf LNG storage facility to meet consumption needs during the coldest days of winter. Yankee Gas obtains its interstate capacity from the three interstate pipelines that directly serve Connecticut: the Algonquin, Tennessee and Iroquois Pipelines, which connect to other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions, including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent, Canadian regions and Appalachian Shale supplies. 
Based on information currently available regarding projected growth in demand and estimates of availability of future supplies of pipeline natural gas, each of NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas believes that participation in planned and anticipated pipeline and storage expansion projects will be required in order for it to meet current and future sales growth opportunities.
WATER DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT
Eversource Water Ventures, Inc., a Connecticut corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eversource Aquarion Holdings, Inc. (Aquarion), operates three separate regulated water utilities in Connecticut (Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, or “AWC-CT”), Massachusetts (Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts, or “AWC-MA”) and New Hampshire (Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire, or “AWC-NH”). These regulated companies provide water services to approximately 228,000 residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and fire protection and other customers, in 59 towns and cities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 87 percent of Aquarion’s customers were based in Connecticut.
Rates
Aquarion's water utilities are subject to regulation by the PURA, the DPU and the NHPUC in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively. These regulatory agencies, have jurisdiction over, among other things, rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.
Aquarion’s general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection services.
The rates established by the PURA, DPU and NHPUC are comprised of the following:

• | A base rate, which is comprised of fixed charges based on meter/fire connection sizes, as well as volumetric charges based on the amount of water sold. Together these charges are designed to recover the full cost of service resulting from a general rate proceeding. 


• | In Connecticut, a revenue adjustment mechanism (“RAM”) that reconciles earned revenues, with certain allowed adjustments, on an annual basis, to the revenue requirement approved by the PURA in AWC-CT’s last rate case (2013), which is an annual amount of $177.9 million.


• | In Connecticut and New Hampshire, a water infrastructure conservation adjustment (“WICA”) charge, which is applied between rate case proceedings and seeks recovery of allowed costs associated with WICA-eligible capital projects placed in-service. The WICA is updated semi-annually in Connecticut and annually in New Hampshire.


• | In Massachusetts, treatment plant surcharges, which are a series of three surcharges in Massachusetts (one fixed and two volumetric in nature) that are designed to recover certain operating costs and the costs of the lease of the treatment plant located in Hingham. These surcharges are applicable only to customers in Hingham, Hull and Cohasset.

Sources and Availability of Water Supply
Our water utilities obtain their water supplies from owned surface water sources (reservoirs) and groundwater supplies (wells) with a total supply yield of approximately 131 million gallons per day, as well as water purchased from other water suppliers. Approximately 98 percent of our annual production is self-supplied and processed at 10 surface water treatment plants and numerous well stations, which are all located in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.
The capacities of Aquarion’s sources of supply, and water treatment, pumping and distribution facilities, are considered sufficient to meet the present requirements of Aquarion’s customers under normal conditions. On occasion, drought declarations are issued for portions of Aquarion’s service territories in response to extended periods of dry weather conditions.
OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS
Bay State Wind is an offshore wind project being jointly developed by Eversource and Denmark-based Ørsted. Bay State Wind is located in a 300-square-mile area of the Atlantic Ocean approximately 25 miles south of the coast of Massachusetts and has the ultimate potential to generate at least 2,000 MW of clean, renewable energy. Eversource and Ørsted each hold a 50 percent ownership interest in Bay State Wind. Bay State Wind has previously submitted proposals, and expects to participate in future solicitations, for offshore wind in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island based on each state's clean energy requirements.
On February 8, 2019, Eversource and Ørsted entered into a 50-50 partnership for key offshore wind assets in the Northeast. Eversource paid approximately $225 million for a 50 percent interest in Ørsted’s Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind power projects, as well as the 257-square-mile tract off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Revolution Wind is a 700 MW offshore wind power project located approximately 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast, and South Fork Wind is approximately a 130 MW offshore wind power project located 35 miles east of Long Island. Subject to permitting, finalized power purchase agreements, where applicable, further development, and final investment decisions by Ørsted and Eversource, Revolution Wind is expected to be commissioned in 2023 and South Fork Wind is expected by the end of 2022.
For more information, see "Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Offshore Wind Projects" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Access Northeast is a natural gas pipeline and storage project jointly owned by Eversource, Enbridge, Inc. ("Enbridge") and National Grid plc ("National Grid"), through Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC ("AGT"). Eversource owns a 40 percent interest in the project, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. In 2018, management determined that the future cash flows of the Access Northeast project were uncertain and could no longer be reasonably estimated and that the book value of our equity method investment was not recoverable. As a result, Eversource recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $32.9 million pre-tax within Other Income, Net on our statement of income in 2018, which represented the full carrying value of our equity method investment. For more information, see "Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Natural Gas Transmission Project" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
PROJECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
We project to make capital expenditures of $12.75 billion from 2019 through 2023, of which we expect $8.06 billion to be in our electric and natural gas distribution segments, $3.35 billion to be in our electric transmission segment and $0.62 billion to be in our water distribution segment. We also project to invest $0.72 billion in information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements. These projections do not include any expected investments related to NPT or offshore wind projects. 
FINANCING
Our credit facilities and indentures require that Eversource parent and certain of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion, comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including maintaining a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization of no more than 65 percent. All of these companies currently are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants. 
As of December 31, 2018, $801.1 million of Eversource's long-term debt, including $350.0 million, $250.0 million, $150.0 million, $50.0 million and $1.1 million for Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, Yankee Gas and Aquarion, respectively, will mature within the next 12 months.

NUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE
CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and several other New England electric utilities are stockholders in three inactive regional nuclear generation companies, CYAPC, MYAPC and YAEC (collectively, the Yankee Companies). The Yankee Companies have completed the physical decommissioning of their respective generation facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent nuclear fuel. The Yankee Companies have completed collection of their decommissioning and closure costs through the proceeds from the spent nuclear fuel litigation against the DOE and have refunded amounts to their member companies. These proceeds were used by the Yankee Companies to offset the decommissioning and closure cost amounts due from their member companies or to decrease the wholesale FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and several other New England utilities. The decommissioning rates charged by the Yankee Companies have been reduced to zero. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH can recover these costs from, or refund proceeds to, their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates. 
We consolidate the assets and obligations of CYAPC and YAEC on our consolidated balance sheet because our ownership and voting interests are more than 50 percent of each of these companies. 
OTHER REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
General
We are regulated in virtually all aspects of our business by various federal and state agencies, including FERC, the SEC, and various state and/or local regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the industry and the service areas in which each of our companies operates, including the PURA, which has jurisdiction over CL&P, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion, the NHPUC, which has jurisdiction over PSNH and Aquarion, and the DPU, which has jurisdiction over NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, and Aquarion.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state and local requirements with respect to water quality, air quality, toxic substances, hazardous waste and other environmental matters. Additionally, major generation and transmission facilities may not be constructed or significantly modified without a review of the environmental impact of the proposed construction or modification by the applicable federal or state agencies. 
Renewable Portfolio Standards
Each of the states in which we do business also has Renewable Portfolio Standards ("RPS") requirements, which generally require fixed percentages of our energy supply to come from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, landfill gas, fuel cells and other similar sources.
New Hampshire's RPS provision requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources. In 2018, the total RPS obligation was 18.7 percent and it will ultimately reach 25.2 percent in 2025. The costs of the RECs are recovered by PSNH through rates charged to customers.
Similarly, Connecticut's RPS statute requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources. In 2018, the total RPS obligation was 25 percent and will ultimately reach 38 percent in 2020. CL&P is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with RPS from its customers through its GSC rate.
Massachusetts' RPS program also requires electricity suppliers to meet renewable energy standards. For 2018, the requirement was 23.365 percent, and will ultimately reach 37.75 percent in 2020. NSTAR Electric is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with RPS from its customers through rates. NSTAR Electric also owns renewable solar power facilities. The RECs generated from NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities are sold to other energy suppliers, and the proceeds from these sales are credited back to customers.
Hazardous Materials Regulations
We have recorded a liability for what we believe, based upon currently available information, is our reasonably estimable environmental investigation, remediation, and/or Natural Resource Damages costs for waste disposal sites for which we have probable liability. Under federal and state law, government agencies and private parties can attempt to impose liability on us for recovery of investigation and remediation costs at hazardous waste sites. As of December 31, 2018, the liability recorded for our reasonably estimable and probable environmental remediation costs for known sites needing investigation and/or remediation, exclusive of recoveries from insurance or from third parties, was $64.7 million, representing 60 sites. These costs could be significantly higher if additional remediation becomes necessary or when additional information as to the extent of contamination becomes available.
The most significant liabilities currently relate to future clean-up costs at former MGP facilities. These facilities were owned and operated by our predecessor companies from the mid-1800's to mid-1900's. By-products from the manufacture of gas using coal resulted in fuel oils, hydrocarbons, coal tar, purifier wastes, metals and other waste products that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment. We currently have partial or full ownership responsibilities at former MGP sites that have a reserve balance of $50.1 million of the total $64.7 million as of December 31, 2018. MGP costs are recoverable through rates charged to our customers.

Electric and Magnetic Fields 
For more than twenty years, published reports have discussed the possibility of adverse health effects from electric and magnetic fields ("EMF") associated with electric transmission and distribution facilities and appliances and wiring in buildings and homes. Although weak health risk associations reported in some epidemiology studies remain unexplained, most researchers, as well as numerous scientific review panels, considering all significant EMF epidemiology and laboratory studies, have concluded that the available body of scientific information does not support the conclusion that EMF affects human health.
In accordance with recommendations of various regulatory bodies and public health organizations, we reduce EMF associated with new transmission lines by the use of designs that can be implemented without additional cost or at a modest cost. We do not believe that other capital expenditures are appropriate to minimize unsubstantiated risks.
Global Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emission Issues
Global climate change and greenhouse gas emission issues have received an increased focus from state governments and the federal government. The EPA initiated a rulemaking addressing greenhouse gas emissions and, on December 7, 2009, issued a finding that concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are "air pollution" that endangers public health and welfare and should be regulated. The EPA has mandated greenhouse gas emission reporting beginning in 2011 for emissions for certain aspects of our business including volume of gas supplied to large customers and fugitive emissions of SF6 gas and methane.
We are continually evaluating the regulatory risks and regulatory uncertainty presented by climate change concerns. Such concerns could potentially lead to additional rules and regulations that impact how we operate our general utility business. These could include federal "cap and trade" laws, carbon taxes, and fuel and energy taxes. We expect that any costs of these rules and regulations would be recovered from customers. 
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, Eversource Energy employed a total of 7,998 employees, excluding temporary employees, of which 1,307 were employed by CL&P, 1,618 were employed by NSTAR Electric, and 736 were employed by PSNH. Approximately 50 percent of our employees are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Utility Workers Union of America or The United Steelworkers, and are covered by nine collective bargaining agreements.
