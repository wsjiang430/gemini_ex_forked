The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Pivotal Acquisition Corp. was treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes.
Overview
 
We are a leading global provider of eDiscovery, information governance and data recovery solutions to corporations, law firms, insurance companies and individuals in 16 countries around the world. With our long- standing history and transformative acquisition in 2016 of Kroll Ontrack, a storied eDiscovery platform with history dating back to 1985, we have decades of experience designing, building, and developing innovative technology solutions that evolve with the needs of our clients. Our integrated, proprietary technology solutions enable clients to efficiently and accurately collect, process, transmit, review and recover complex and large-scale enterprise data. In conjunction with our proprietary technology, we provide immediate expert consultation and 24/7/365 support worldwide, empowering us to be a “first-call” partner for mission-critical, time-sensitive, and nuanced eDiscovery and data recovery challenges. We leverage our proprietary technology solutions and extensive industry expertise to provide a more reliable, secure and seamless experience for our clients when tackling “big data” volume, velocity, and veracity challenges.


A key example of our purpose-built innovation is Nebula, our flagship, end-to-end AI / ML powered solution that serves as a singular platform of engagement for legal and other types of data. We also offer clients the optionality they desire—KLDiscovery-developed or externally-developed software and cloud-based or a number of different on-premise data storage options. We processed 8,009 and 7,823 Legal Technology matters for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, and currently average over 32,000 data recoveries annually from all types of storage media. We believe our scale, expertise, proprietary technology and optionality, and global presence uniquely positions us to be the go-to partner for our clients and solve the world’s largest and most complicated data challenges.
 
Since January 1, 2020, we have provided services to a highly diverse base of more than 5,800 Legal Technology clients. Our Legal Technology clients include both law firms and corporations serving many industry sectors including finance and banking, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, technology, insurance, and real estate. Our data recovery clients include corporations and individuals that need to recover and access data. Our loyal client base includes 96% of the highest-grossing law firms in the United States as ranked by American Lawyer, known as the Am Law 100, as well as 50% of Fortune 500 companies, as of December 31, 2022. We have longstanding relationships with many of our clients. For example, the average length of our relationships with our top 25 clients based on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 is approximately 15 years. We actively collect and review feedback from our clients to ensure we are investing in the features and services that address their ever-evolving needs. We believe our commitment to being a “first-call” provider for our clients’ largest and most complex cases has helped drive significant revenues from larger and more complex matters, with Legal Technology matters generating over $100,000 and $500,000 in revenue representing 77% and 47%, respectively, of our Legal Technology revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 
The legal technology industry is fragmented and bifurcated into dozens of software providers, which concentrate on technology solutions, and service providers, which license software and focus on client support to assist with managing the third-party technology. Software providers have increasingly prioritized DIY solutions and generally lack full-service support to address complex data challenges, while service providers have relied on multiple, disparate third-party tools and systems that are limited in the client use cases they can address. We bridged this gap by establishing KLDiscovery as a leading legal technology provider with scale that merges state of the art proprietary software and white-glove services. This combination allows us to manage incidents from an organization’s smallest concerns to its most complex legal reviews, as well as time and strategically sensitive legal matters.
 
As the first provider to license Relativity, a ubiquitous document review tool, we set a new standard in eDiscovery workflow, being the first provider to reach over one million records on the platform. Since then, we have developed KLD AI and review automation proprietary tools to augment the Relativity offering. For those clients who may choose to use third-party tools like Relativity for data hosting, we complement and enhance their experience via our proprietary toolkit to maximize the hosting platform’s functionality.
 
In response to an increasing number of clients seeking an end-to-end, fully integrated offering, we launched our proprietary cloud-native Nebula ecosystem in 2018. Nebula is a differentiated, comprehensive platform that addresses the full lifecycle of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model, or EDRM. Nebula is designed for enterprise adoption and can be seamlessly applied to address a multitude of use cases for the global legal and corporate communities. Clients who utilize our all-in-one platform benefit from a scalable, singular repository for their legal workflow processes, while reducing costs, and reducing data security risks inherent when processing and transferring data across multiple disparate systems and service providers. Nebula also offers clients flexibility in data delivery methods; in the public cloud, in our secure data centers, behind the client’s firewall in an enterprise server-rack and at a client’s location via Nebula Portable, optionality no other provider’s proprietary platform can offer. Regardless of data storage location, clients can seamlessly manage their data through the integrated Nebula platform. Demonstrating Nebula’s potential, we have experienced strong growth in Nebula revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Nebula revenue was $28.4 million, a 9.7% increase from the prior year. Our diversified and deep-rooted client relationships provide a large and loyal user base to further accelerate the adoption and growth of Nebula.


As Nebula’s capabilities continue to offer additional upstream use cases beyond eDiscovery, our clients are able to leverage our technology throughout their respective eDiscovery lifecycles. For example, we offer clients Nebula Archive, which captures data across numerous platforms and provides a secure, searchable copy of data under preservation, as well as Nebula Legal Hold, which allows clients to ingest and manage hold data from any source. We believe the breadth of Nebula presents an attractive entry point for us to engage with clients early and bring them onto our platform.
 
Additionally, we are a global leader of data recovery services, currently averaging over 32,000 data recoveries annually from all types of storage media. With our in-lab, remote, and on-site capabilities, we recover data at an over 80% success rate from almost any device, storage manufacturer, operating system, database, and back up format. We expect to continue to benefit from our deep data recovery competencies, given the increasing relevance of data privacy and cybersecurity issues at the institutional, governmental, and international levels.
 
We believe we have a strong runway to capture a greater percentage of our large and growing market opportunity. Our unique combination of proprietary software and technology-enabled services, coupled with our full stack, scalable platform that covers the full EDRM life cycle, best positions us to tackle our clients’ “big data” challenges. Moreover, we believe our proprietary Nebula offering, unlike other existing solutions, offers broad flexibility in deployment methods, cost efficiency with customizable pricing models, and optimized accuracy with its underlying AI / ML technology. We see further opportunity to grow our sales among new and existing clients, scale internationally, and extend our technology leadership.

Industry background
 
The rule of law is integral to society—it is the foundation for systems of justice, underpins government functions, and upholds fair economic transactions and social development. From multi-national corporations and governments to local businesses and individual citizens, millions rely on legal services to navigate complex matters and uphold the law in an ever-changing world. According to Statista, legal services represents one of the largest sectors in the global economy, with worldwide spend estimated to increase to $846 billion in 2023. As technology continues to revolutionize the legal services industry, there is a significant existing market opportunity for legal technology solutions that should continue to grow.
 
While the legal technology industry is vast and diverse, most organizations in the industry fall into one of four categories:
 •Corporations and other entities—Ultimately the “end buyers” of technology and services, they hire law firms and providers to help them navigate legal, regulatory, and cyber matters
 •Law firms—Often seen as an intermediary between providers and corporations/government entities, law firms often make provider decisions on behalf of their clients. Law firms are also consumers of legal technology and solutions themselves, both for in-house matters and as an extension of their litigation technology teams. As a result, law firms not only become direct sources of revenue for service and software providers, but also an important source of referrals to corporations that providers can leverage to build direct relationships
 •Service providers—License and package technology and provide services to corporations and government entities and the law firms they work with. Most service providers of any scale have some proprietary technology, but very few have material portfolios and instead rely largely on licensing third party tools
 •Software providers—Create technology solutions that service providers rely on, but often take a “hands-off” approach with respect to substantive matter support or client service. They typically offer only software without domain expertise and support that goes beyond the software itself. This DIY approach is not equipped to handle large engagements. Moreover, most software providers focus their technology to a particular segment of the EDRM and/or a specific delivery vehicle, forcing buyers to maintain multiple relationships to ensure all their needs are satisfied


Despite the clear distinctions among these categories, there is often overlap between their needs. Service providers commonly license and repackage technology with their services to law firms and corporations, who typically lack the full requisite of resources and domain expertise. Additionally, each organization has specific needs and requirements relating to where data can be hosted, ranging from entirely cloud to entirely behind their firewall, or somewhere in between. While each organization’s technology and service needs are unique, software providers can nevertheless market their solutions to all of those organizations, due to the overlap in needs.
 
These dynamics underscore the market potential for software providers and highlight the opportunity that exists today for a solution that has broad functionality, around-the-clock client service, and optionality in delivery vehicles to meet all of a buyer’s data needs.
 
Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM)
 



eDiscovery
 
eDiscovery is a critical component of the legal industry: parties preserve, collect, review, and exchange information electronically for the purpose of using it as evidence in a civil, criminal or investigative legal case or regulatory action. Electronically Stored Information or, ESI, in eDiscovery can range from simple data sources such as emails, word documents, and databases, to increasingly modern and complex data sources such as social media messages, cell phone data, and mobile applications, such as internal digital chat data, and audio / visual calls. The volume and complexity of eDiscovery varies significantly from case-to-case, ranging from small matters comprising little data to highly complex matters with vast amounts of enterprise data where support from technology and legal experts is essential. According to complexdiscovery.com, the worldwide eDiscovery software and services market is forecasted to grow from $14.0 billion in 2022 to $22.3 billion by 2027 due to the proliferation of data and legal challenges, thereby underscoring eDiscovery’s growing significance and use cases.
 
The eDiscovery market is highly fragmented, resulting in low penetration divided amongst many vendors. Further, within the eDiscovery industry, there is a significant disconnect between software providers and service providers. Most service providers of any scale have some proprietary technology, but very few have material portfolios and instead rely largely on licensing third party tools. These vendors lack fundamental control over the products they resell, which weakens the user experience and diminishes lifetime value.
 
Information governance
 Information governance is a rapidly maturing discipline, the objective of which is to enable enterprises to manage their huge and growing data estates, taking into account the many demands placed upon that data. These demands include everything from ready access to data for business utility and continuity, to data protection against ransomware and other cyber-attacks, to complying with proliferating privacy and other regulatory requirements, to responding to regulatory investigations and civil litigation. Radicati estimates the information governance market will grow to approximately $8.9 billion in 2024.
 
Vendors that offer versatile solutions can help minimize costly and duplicative workflows arising from using separate systems to address multiple needs. Information governance products also serve as attractive entry points for new eDiscovery business opportunities. We expect increases in legal and regulatory demands, and burgeoning data volumes, as well as strategic needs to protect data from cyber-attacks, to drive the growing adoption of information governance solutions.
 
Data recovery
 Data recovery technology providers help clients, ranging from Fortune 500 companies to individual consumers, recover data that would otherwise be lost for a myriad of reasons, such as system failures, accidental deletion, physical damage, natural disasters, ransomware or user error. Data recovery companies use software tools and physical inspection to diagnose and determine the condition of the media and what data may be recovered. Then, they make an image of the data and perform a logical reconstruction of it. In the case of physical damage, large- scale facilities are required as the device may need to be disassembled in a clean room lab and spare parts used to facilitate the recovery. According to the IDC, the worldwide data protection market, which consists of data recovery, archives, and backup spending, is expected to grow to $18.4 billion in 2025.
 
Many of the vendors in this fragmented industry are small electronics repair shops using off-the-shelf data recovery software tools. Many smaller data recovery vendors can recover data from hard disk or external drives, while some have the capability to assist with more complex data recovery from servers, storage systems, and networks. Very few global data recovery providers support large-scale operations such as clean room labs and physical data recovery capabilities. Data recovery also complements eDiscovery and information governance by minimizing the amount of data that cannot be recovered from lost or deleted files.
 
Our solutions
 
We are a legal technology pioneer with a long-standing presence developing proprietary technology solutions. We provide an expansive suite of technology offerings including our end-to-end fully integrated solution, Nebula, which comprehensively addresses information governance, eDiscovery and data recovery needs. Our solutions have been developed in-house by capitalizing on our more than 15 years of technology expertise and legal process management experience. As the first provider to license Relativity, we have developed an entire suite of proprietary technology solutions that creates a bespoke and enhanced experience within the platform.
 
We introduced Nebula, our proprietary platform, in 2018 after years of learning from our many client relationships and the engagements on which we support them. Our vast experience taught us that our clients needed one comprehensive and integrated platform that can be used to complete all steps of the information governance and EDRM process, and we believe Nebula fills this critical need. Complemented by our world-class client service, Nebula empowers our clients with flexible, scalable, and innovative tools. As a result, unlike other providers who cannot update the third-party software they sell in real-time or technology companies who are unable to provide after-sale support, we fully control our proprietary technology—along with the user experience—enabling us to serve as a unified one-stop shop.
 
KLDiscovery value proposition
 
Highly differentiated combination of proprietary software and human capital
 We believe our position as the differentiated legal technology provider with proprietary, state of the art, EDRM software combined with our white-glove services will help drive retention and support client growth. We have spent over 15 years investing in, delivering, and perfecting data-centric technology, including our flagship eDiscovery solution, Nebula. At the same time, we built a successful track record of solving some of the most challenging legal data problems through a combination of our proprietary technology and service-oriented culture. As the relationship between software and service providers shifts within the legal industry, we are well- positioned to disrupt the space as a singular, end-to-end and trusted provider of both software and services.

We employ different pricing structures across our large suite of offerings including usage-based subscriptions, transactional, à la carte, and alternative fee arrangements for software such as our proprietary Nebula platform and our technology-enabled services and data recovery engagements. We set transparent and attractive pricing, which allows us to deepen our relationships with our large, blue-chip client base. We believe the ease of our pricing structure and solutions, even for the largest and most complex organizations, provides critical entry points for us to onboard additional products and expand beyond traditional use cases. As the strategic value of our technology solutions continues to grow, our pricing strategy will attract both existing and new clients deeper into our ecosystem.
 
Our business model
 
We offer differentiated solutions to our clients via a flexible and scalable, usage-based business model, where, as an example, clients pay us on the basis of the amount of data processed, ingested, and/or reviewed on our platform, which drives future business opportunities. Our proprietary data and technology fuels referrals from our large global client base. As more clients begin to use our software and solutions, we have opportunities to cross- and up-sell to drive growth of our complementary features and add-ons. By continuously expanding our usage, we increase our global reach and create more value for clients and stakeholders.
 •Pricing—We predominately employ a usage-based pricing model for our technology platforms, such as Nebula. For these solutions, our pricing is measured by the amount of data ingested, hosted, produced, and/or reviewed. Since no single structure works for every client, we also offer a 

subscription-based model, where clients commit to a set capacity of usage over a pre-defined term (typically one to three years) at a discount over the usage-based rates typically associated with project-by-project engagements. Our data recovery engagements are fixed fee arrangements.
 •Client benefits—We offer simplicity and flexibility for our clients. Our usage-based model is designed to scale and adopt to our clients’ changing needs. With no user fees, Nebula pricing is transparent and allows clients to efficiently budget and support any legal, project, and technology demands.
 •Network effect—As we continue to grow, we accumulate more data across our ecosystem, which strengthens our technology capabilities and enhances user experience, which attracts even more clients. We allow our clients to store and reuse data for future legal purposes which can serve as the starting point for new sales opportunities. Our AI / ML technology continuously processes more data and observes human usage to refine our platform for increased efficiency and relevancy.
 •Partner Channel Subscriptions—Starting in 2022, we began offering multi-year agreements for Nebula based on usage tiers. With existing software solutions limited by any combination of expensive pricing models, limited features, and a lack of delivery options, we believe there is an under serviced population of buyers ranging from eDiscovery providers, law firms, corporations, to other organizations that can immediately benefit from Nebula.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenues arising from usage-based agreements comprised 89.9% and 90.7% of revenue, respectively, while subscription agreements comprised 10.1% and 9.3% of revenue, respectively.
 
Our clients
 
Our Legal Technology clients include both law firms and corporations serving many industry sectors including finance and banking, pharmaceutical and biotechnology, technology, insurance, and real estate. Our data recovery clients include corporations and individuals that need to recover and access data.
 
Our definition of a Legal Technology client includes each primary law firm and corporation to which we provided services in a litigation matter that we billed during the past two years. Since January 1, 2020, we provided services to more than 5,800 Legal Technology clients. As of December 31, 2022, our clients include 96% of the Am Law 100 and 50% of Fortune 500 companies.
 
We have longstanding relationships with our clients; the average length of our client relationship with the top 25 clients for the year ended December 31, 2022 is 15 years. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 we had one single customer that represented approximately six percent (6%) of our consolidated revenues and one single customer that represented approximately six percent (6%) of our consolidated accounts receivable and, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not have a single customer that represented more than five percent (5%) or more of our consolidated revenues or accounts receivable.

Our key differentiators
 
A trusted partner for the most complex, mission critical legal matters and data needs
 
Through our decades of experience, we have built a reputation of technological excellence and “first-call” expertise for the most complex legal and data challenges worldwide. Our proven ability to perform the most difficult legal data reviews (such as antitrust second requests, joint defense, and large-scale M&A matters) and help our clients through their most challenging moments (such as mitigating and navigating a ransomware event) has made us a critical partner for our clients. Our proprietary technology capabilities and ability to evolve with the needs of our clients results in better outcomes for their organizations. By building a reputation as a trusted legal solution provider, we have created a loyal client base that will allow us to drive future business opportunities and expand the reach of our offerings including Nebula. Our comprehensive offerings distinctly position us to navigate our dedicated client base through the technological transformation of the legal industry while serving as a critical partner for all their legal technology needs.


Comprehensive technology solutions that expand beyond traditional eDiscovery use cases
 
As Nebula continues to expand further upstream within the EDRM, our technology is leveraged earlier in the data lifecycle, opening an attractive entry point for engaging our clients and moving them along the eDiscovery journey within our end-to-end Nebula platform. We believe our position as a one-stop platform that offers comprehensive solutions allows clients to contract with a single provider, avoiding frictions and risks in moving data and contracting multiple providers. Additionally, we are a global leader of data recovery services, supporting both small businesses and large enterprises with business server recoveries and backup tape restorations. Our proprietary incident response solutions enable our clients to recover from the deletion or destruction of data due to malicious or accidental incidents. The rapid proliferation of ransomware episodes faced by organizations worldwide validates the value of data today and how critical it is to retrieve.

We possess a unique combination of industry-leading scale, with our loyal client base of more than 5,800 Legal Technology clients and with offices in 16 different countries as of December 31, 2022, and financial flexibility. We have a strong track record of funding our growth expansion in a disciplined manner, and we believe our robust financial profile affords us the continued financial flexibility to do so.

Our growth strategy
 
Building on the many strengths of our existing business and strategy, we are focused on continuing to enhance our proprietary solutions, expand our ecosystem, and extend our reach to capitalize on our large and growing market opportunity.
 
•Extend our technology leadership with continued innovation and platform expansion. We have successfully built a strong technology platform based on years of research and feedback from our clients and strive to further invest in research and development to maintain our track record of innovation. We plan to drive growth by expanding the functionality of our current platform, including the Nebula ecosystem, and broaden the range of products we offer. In addition, we will continue working to be an industry leader for ease of client experience through seamless integration with clients’ back-office functions. We will also seek to capitalize on our highly transparent pricing to capture mission-critical, high value, and long-term revenue opportunities. As we continue to innovate and increase our value proposition and address clients’ challenges within eDiscovery, information governance, and data recovery, we believe we will strengthen the breadth of our premium product offerings, increase penetration of existing clients, and grow our addressable market.
 •Continue to increase adoption of Nebula on a global scale. Our large and deep-rooted client relationships on a global basis provide a loyal base to expand adoption of Nebula, in addition to new service providers, law firms, and corporations. As we continue to innovate and improve Nebula’s offerings, we plan to gradually transition our clients who rely on third-party software onto our proprietary Nebula platform. For these clients who may use a different eDiscovery platform, we believe we can increase Nebula adoption by introducing and educating these clients to the advantages of our proprietary and differentiated platform. With new functionalities continuing to be released in 2023 and beyond, such as granular document-level permissions and enhanced analytics, we believe Nebula will further differentiate itself versus offerings from other providers, thus allowing us to capture a larger total addressable market within eDiscovery.
 •Grow our client base and drive incremental penetration within existing clients. With the increased adoption of technological solutions within the legal industry and more organizations opting for functional solutions like those we offer, we see significant client growth potential for our business. We will continue to drive brand awareness on the robust functionalities, ease of use, and high degree of customizability of our offerings, in order to accelerate the growth of new clients. We believe that Nebula, our differentiated end-to-end offering that spans the eDiscovery lifecycle, positions us to up- and cross-sell additional products to existing clients seeking to reap the full benefits of our comprehensive product suite. We believe our release of new products, tools, add-ons, and features has increased the value we provide to our clients, and our growing product capabilities will continue to attract new and maintain existing clients.
 •Build partner channels. In 2022, we began to build our partner channel by selling subscriptions for Nebula, and as of December 31, 2022 we had seven partners in our partner channel. These agreements generally have a minimum one-year commitment and our goal is to have a two-year average commitment across our entire partner channel. We will leverage and broaden our partnerships with other eDiscovery providers, law firms, corporations, consulting firms and other organizations to drive growth and bring innovation to the global legal community. Nebula’s comprehensive capabilities and competitive pricing will allow us to target multiple partner market segments, spanning those seeking a single “one-stop-shop” solution to those who may require a point solution to process and triage small data volumes in-house for loading to other applications. The subscriptions are generally based on usage tiers and offer all of our technology for the client’s use, with the option to pay extra for services. By building a partner channel for Nebula, we are able to generate revenue opportunities from a brand-new population of buyers and further increase industry awareness and utilization of Nebula.
 •Expand and strengthen sales force coverage. We continue to recruit, attract and retain top sales professionals to capture untapped clients and we intend to hire more sales professionals to drive growth. We pride ourselves in our high-quality and globally integrated salesforce and their ability to 

bring in significant revenue. They are cross trained across our product suite so they can sell our comprehensive offerings to new and existing clients.
•Further our presence in international markets. The eDiscovery market is global, and we continue to invest to increase our market share worldwide. We already have an established presence in 16 countries with qualified sales reps and client support. Internationally, our flexible delivery models (such as Microsoft Azure and Nebula Enterprise) enable us to more easily penetrate new markets and better adapt to the varied and unique data handling requirements and regulations that our clients face across different geographies.
 •Pursue opportunistic strategic acquisitions. We continue to seek acquisitions that will expand the depth and breadth of our product offerings and make us the provider of choice for existing and new clients. With our strong leadership and demonstrated success of our platform, we believe we will be able to attract strong acquisition targets going forward. Our past acquisitions demonstrate our management’s ability to effectively source, execute, and integrate acquisitions into our existing and growing platform. We plan to continue to opportunistically pursue our acquisition strategy to continue to provide more comprehensive offerings for the highly fragmented eDiscovery and information governance industries.

Nebula
 
Nebula epitomizes the modern, cloud-native application boasting the latest in AI / ML. Our award-winning software development and data science teams have incorporated best-of-breed technologies ranging from our own patented AI / ML technology to cutting-edge public cloud machine learning suites throughout Nebula to enhance efficiencies, streamline user experiences, and drive results.
 
Nebula can be delivered across numerous delivery vehicles, allowing the technology to be viable for virtually any use-case.
 
•Hosted in Microsoft Azure—Nebula maximizes the scalability, resiliency, and performance benefits of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, delivering a powerful and fully optimized SaaS solution. Nebula is currently available via Azure with a wide regional diversity to address data sovereignty considerations across the globe. Clients with cloud-first strategies, or those with “in-region” mandates, will easily satisfy those requirements by utilizing the Nebula global cloud footprint. Further, we are always expanding Nebula’s global reach with multiple new regions added each year.
 As with all Nebula deployments, security and compliance are top requirements. Microsoft Azure supports compliance with a broad set of industry-specific laws and meets comprehensive international standards. For example, Azure has ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, ISO 22301, ISO 9001 certifications, PCI DSS Level 1 validation, SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 attestations, HIPAA Business Associate Agreement, and HITRUST certification. Operated and maintained globally, Microsoft Azure is regularly and independently verified for compliance with industry and international standards and provides clients the foundation to achieve compliance for their applications.
 •Hosted in Nebula data centers—Nebula is also hosted in seven countries strategically positioned globally. We continually invest in our overall infrastructure. Running the same code as our other deployment models, our hosted SaaS deployments boast the same highly efficient, containerized, auto-scaling capabilities as do our cloud deployments. All our deployments are built for high availability, strong uptime, and robust disaster recovery and business continuity in the event of major disruptions. We maintain a global security governance program designed to meet current best-in-class security practices. Nebula’s infrastructure is regularly audited to maintain ISO 27001 certification. In addition, 

our data centers in North America are audited for SOC II compliance. Both audits assess the security standards, procedures, controls, and related practices deployed throughout our global operations. We believe Nebula provides the highest levels of performance, data protection, and fault tolerance, and unparalleled disaster recovery capabilities.
 •Portable appliance—Nebula Portable is an encrypted device that is the size of a carry-on suitcase that functions as an entirely private and isolated Nebula instance. As with all our applications, security is of the utmost importance—providing clients with an elegant air-gapped solution for needs including data privacy, fraud investigations, cross-border litigation, and reviewing highly sensitive data.
 •Enterprise appliance—Though Nebula, we are expanding availability of a rack-mounted solution to accommodate the geographic and data control needs of our clients. Nebula Enterprise brings the power, flexibility, and enhanced feature set of Nebula to clients’ data centers in a plug-and-play expandable appliance designed to address a myriad of security and compliance considerations. The capacity of our enterprise models ranges from a five terabyte model designed for corporations or law-firms seeking a small scale, low maintenance, in-house eDiscovery capability solution up to a 100 terabyte model for a large eDiscovery vendor’s entire technology stack.
 oReliability—Designed for long-term installation with minimal maintenance, Nebula Enterprise is self-healing, meaning the system can automatically restore normal operations in the event of hardware failure. Administrators are notified when an element requires replacement, and maintenance can be scheduled while maintaining functionality in the interim.
 oScalability—With different sizes available to meet client needs, this enterprise-grade hardware solution is offered as an annual subscription. In addition, Nebula Enterprise’s storage can be expanded to larger tiers as a client’s organization grows.
 oComprehensive dashboard—An integrated dashboard allows client’s IT staff to control and configure the system. In the event additional assistance is needed, secure remote support can be authorized through the dashboard.
 oScheduled Nebula updates—Nebula Enterprise subscribers receive complete Nebula upgrades, with the flexibility to schedule updates at a convenient time or manually initiate installations. Enterprise software is on the same release schedule as the other delivery models, so clients’ data is never stranded in any one delivery model.
 
Nebula includes an array of tools and features including:
 
•Email Threading—Determines the relationship between email messages and identifies the most content-inclusive messages to avoid redundant review.
 •Near-Duplicate Detection—Identifies, groups, and highlights data with focus on subtle differences to enable quicker review. 
 •Language Identification—Automatically identifies the primary language of documents in a dataset.
 •KLD Translations—Leverages advanced machine translation based on the current gold standard in translation AI, neural networks, to get accurate and reliable translations of documents written in many of the most common languages used across the globe. A fast and cost-saving alternative to human multi-lingual review.
 •Native Spreadsheet Redaction—Allows reviewers to redact content from within Excel files without the need to convert to TIFF images. Options for redactions include removing cells, rows, columns, worksheets, formulas, images, and more. Pristine copies of the original file are always maintained.
 •A/V Suite—Winner of Innovation Awards for Best Service Provider Solution and People’s Choice, A/V Suite simplifies the review of multimedia files. A/V suite allows users to visualize audio files and have total playback control in addition to providing the ability to quickly redact and produce audio files— something no other review platform can provide.

•Auto Redaction—Protect sensitive information and streamline the redaction process with an automated approach. Greatly reduce the burden of redacting documents by automatically finding and redacting personally identifiable information or any other category of sensitive information.
 •PrivLog Builder—PrivLog Builder, or PLB, is an integrated suite of tools with advanced functionality to build privilege logs effectively and accurately. With automated privilege log features, name standardization and full compatibility with the most popular review platforms, PLB makes a daunting and costly process easier and significantly less expensive.
 
Nebula Archive
 
Nebula Archive provides a critical foundation to any information governance program. It captures data as it is created in dozens of platforms, such as Office 365, Slack, Box, and more. It provides the means to effectively classify and manage that data over the course of its lifecycle, including reliably preserving data subject to legal hold. It offers excellent data assurance against loss or alteration via a separate, secure copy of critical business data. It also enhances data with the ability to search and effectively retrieve targeted results, even from petabytes of source data. Lastly, it reliably and defensibly disposes of data no longer required to be retained for any business or regulatory compliance purpose.
 
Nebula Archive provides an alternative and/or enhancement to traditional backup solutions, particularly in the cloud era when many SaaS productivity platforms lack effective recovery means in response to inadvertent data loss, alteration, or ransomware attacks. Nebula Archive offers a platform that is designed to satisfy strict retention and data assurance regulations, such as those of FINRA and the SEC governing broker-dealer communications. In addition, it is the foundation of a cost-effective eDiscovery strategy, permitting what we believe is unprecedented insight into data very early in a case and a highly effective means of selecting the most relevant data for quick and easy promotion within the Nebula platform.
 
KLD AI and review automation
 
To support our review platforms, we offer cutting-edge tools for our users that enhances productivity and efficiency for eDiscovery.
 
•Machine Learning—Our supervised machine learning, known as Predictive Coding in the legal industry, supports multiple workflows and methodologies and helps prioritize essential documents for review. As a result, we can automate the classification of electronic data, drastically reducing the time required for legal review and creating significant cost savings. Our predictive coding technology gets smarter with every document reviewed and supports proven statistical methodologies to create defensible workflows. In addition, we offer Predictive Coding in multiple ways including TAR 1.0 or Simple Active Learning and TAR 2.0 or Continuous Active Learning, which provides flexibility and optionality for our clients.
 •Automated Workflow—Our workflow engine automates the routing and distribution of documents to streamline document review and maximize accuracy and defensibility—a key component of our bespoke document review offering. Workflow eliminates the need to maintain static batch sets and manually transition records to different review teams. Instead, documents flow automatically through completely customizable paths based on an endless number of potential criteria: foreign-language documents to native speakers; privileged documents to senior attorneys; random samples of reviewed documents to quality control teams; and so on. Since documents cannot move on without meeting defined criteria, an additional layer of quality control is built in. Workflow works hand-in-hand with Predictive Coding to make the review even more efficient.
 •Workflow Reporting Suite—For large, complex document review projects, monitoring reviewer productivity and accuracy is paramount to achieving cost efficiency and accuracy. Workflow reporting suite is exclusively available in Nebula and provides dynamic, on-demand information on the progress, productivity, and tagging trends for document review projects run within the Workflow system.
 •Natural Language Processing—Also exclusive to Nebula, powerful language-based AI enables users to gain meaningful insights into their data. For example, it can visually locate and search for 

documents about named entities, such as locations, events, and key people, with the added ability to filter for documents containing critical language by analyzing the author’s sentiment.
 
Nebula’s entity extraction engine is trained to recognize eight distinct categories of real-world entities, then visually cluster documents referencing the same entities. This approach, based on semantic understanding rather than simple word frequency, provides enhanced insight into the data, allowing users to isolate and retrieve relevant information or filter non-relevant material quickly. Nebula can also uncover topics that might otherwise go unnoticed, giving legal teams an advantage.
 
Nebula’s sentiment analysis tools analyze tone at both the document and sentence levels. At its core, sentiment analysis applies Natural Language Processing techniques and computational linguistics to derive emotional attributes from text content. By leveraging sentiment analysis, users can better understand how communications are perceived and help discern the author’s tone and intent. This gives Nebula users an edge in contexts where more than just the words themselves matter, as in, for example, matters related to workplace harassment. Companies can use this feature to learn the tone of their employees to help determine if communications are positive, negative, or neutral, and help understand the behaviors and communication styles of employees and clients to identify trends and identify bad actors.
 
Processing
 
Our proprietary technology is purpose-built to address large and complex matters as easily and efficiently as it does the small and simple ones. With full integration in the Nebula ecosystem, our Processing technology allows us to address diverse needs on a massive, global scale.
 
We believe Nebula Processing allows us to process data with a higher degree of quality and, due to the lack of third-party licensing costs, at a lower cost point, as compared to providers relying exclusively on licensed technology. For organizations licensing Nebula for their eDiscovery needs—providers, law firms, and corporations alike—they reap the benefits of a mature processing technology that can not only be used at any scale and for any data set, but is also fully integrated and does not require any of the wrappers or clunky export/ import processes that come with licensing disparate third-party solutions.
 
Professional services
 
Leveraging our industry expertise and focus on delivering differentiated user experience, we complement our offerings with a suite of technology-enabled services.
 
•Technology Enabled Managed Review Services—We can provide staffing and expertise necessary to review large and complex data sets with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency to suit any and all cases. Our Managed Review Solutions are powered by our suite of proprietary technology, led by our AI and workflow accelerators that lead to a faster, more accurate, and most cost-effective review.
 •Digital Forensics Services—Specializes in computer forensics, including collections and analysis, through in-person and remote locations.
 •Information Archiving Services—Offers information preservation for long-term access and enhancing access to large volumes of information through scalable, enterprise-grade storage solutions.
 •Advisory Services—Our team of experts provides unique perspectives and insights derived from extensive legal and regulatory knowledge, deep technical expertise, and real-world experience. Spanning all aspects of discovery and data management, our professional guidance is a complementary service to existing KLD solutions and critical for us in winning very large mandates that require astute client-focused expertise. Solutions offered encompass: eDiscovery readiness and response solutions, including eDiscovery expert witness, custodian interviews, preservation and collection strategy, legal hold solution; information governance solutions comprising Office 365 health check and legal hold process improvement; and data privacy solutions, including privacy compliance assessment and data breach risk mitigation.
 

Client Portal
 
The Client Portal is a secure, web-based platform offered by KLDiscovery that provides clients with access to their data and case information. It offers real-time visibility and updates on project status, as well as the ability to collaborate and share information with other stakeholders. The Client Portal is designed to streamline communication and increase efficiency throughout the discovery process. With its user-friendly interface and robust security features, the Client Portal is a valuable tool for organizations in need of a centralized platform for managing their discovery and litigation support needs.
 
Data recovery
 
Ontrack EasyRecovery
 
Developed through our partnership with one of the world’s leading data recovery software manufacturers, Ontrack EasyRecovery allows clients to perform precise file recovery of data lost through deletion, reformatting, and a number of other data loss scenarios. The product recovers data from solid-state drives and conventional hard drives, memory cards, USB hard drives, flash drives, and optical media. The product functions on both Windows and Mac operating systems and comes in several different versions, covering needs ranging from a small, one-time recovery to the most complex projects. There is a “free” version that is capable of recovering up to 1 GB of data, a “Home” version for straightforward recoveries, a “Professional” version suitable for small to medium businesses, and a “Technician” version that includes the tools needed to successfully perform data recoveries on all types of computer storage devices and rebuild broken RAID volumes.
 
Ontrack PowerControls
 
We believe Ontrack PowerControls is a market leading granular restore software product, developed from Ontrack’s expertise in data recovery. Ontrack PowerControls is used to find and export email, SharePoint items and structured query language tables for eDiscovery, litigation, investigations, compliance, selective migration, develop and test, and general restore use cases for IT.
 
We believe Ontrack PowerControls provides a more powerful and faster search tool than native tools, and, most importantly for legal and compliance use cases, it does not alter the metadata, making it forensically sound. Most enterprise backup platforms do not have granular restore capabilities, so they collaborate with Ontrack and integrate Ontrack PowerControls with their products.
 
We are currently licensing Ontrack PowerControls globally to more than 200 organizations, and to over 800 channel partners for distribution to their customers.
 
Ransomware recovery
 
Ransomware is a form of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or certain data or publishes a victim’s data online. The attacker demands a ransom from the victim, promising—not always truthfully—to restore access to the data upon payment. When organizations are struck with ransomware, and crucial data cannot be accessed, it can be an extremely stressful time for all involved. Getting access to that critical data as quickly as possible is vital to ensure downtime is minimized and the organization can get back to normal.
 
The last decade has seen an increase of various ransomware Trojans surface, but the real opportunity for attackers has increased since the introduction of Bitcoin. This and other cryptocurrencies allow attackers to easily collect money from their victims without going through traditional channels.
 
No vertical is safe from the effects of ransomware. Unfortunately, some are more susceptible to successful attacks than others. There are various reasons for this: the technology they deploy, the security they have in place; identity governance and privilege maturity, and their overall cybersecurity protocols. And human error will always pose its own risks.
 
We continually track over 360 different types of ransomware, a population that is always evolving and growing. Ransomware changes and develops all of the time, so we want to make sure we are watching and studying the latest changes and advancements. Studying ransomware and its ever-changing forms provides additional knowledge and experience, leading to a higher probability that we will recover data that has been lost as a result of an attack.
 
Email extraction
 
We offer professional email recovery solutions for consumers and businesses alike. From individual files to entire databases, we maintain the expertise and technology to support practically any use case. The success of email recovery depends on where the email is stored. Email software, such as Microsoft Outlook, commonly stores email on hardware like a laptop, desktop, mobile phone, tablet, or server. We can easily recover email from both functioning and non-functioning hardware. Additionally, our recovery engineers are experienced in recovering enterprise email no matter how it is stored on a client’s server, whether it is inside a database, a Microsoft Exchange Information Store or individual messages in separate files, such as .pst containers.
 
Tape Solutions
 
We provide a range of tape services to solve the problems associated with legacy backup tapes and regularly support our clients to solve the following challenges:
 
•backup infrastructure migration and consolidation;
 •legacy tape and data remediation;
 •recovery from physically-damaged tapes; and
 •recovery from quickly-erased or partially-overwritten tapes.
 
Data destruction solutions
 
Permanently deleting data is not as straightforward as pressing the delete button—it takes time and proper resources. Data that is not completely expunged before the media is disposed of is vulnerable to exposure. To increase the security of data, a secure, verified data destruction process is required. Based on their knowledge, our data experts seek to select and execute the most appropriate data destruction method for the client’s media. Once the data has been destroyed, we provide a certificate of destruction and disposal.
 
We support our clients throughout the whole data destruction process by offering data destruction solutions in our labs or onsite using Blancco Erasing Software or our Ontrack Degausser. For clients who want to handle the data destruction process themselves, we sell these products to the client and advise them how to best use them.
 
Sales
 
We operate with a global sales team that was integrated in 2020 across our offerings to address the specialized needs of our client base and cultivate strategic partnerships with key clients in our industry. As of December 31, 2022, our sales organization comprised of 61 professionals and is led by our sales executives and regional managers. Our business development managers have developed “first-call” relationships with several of our largest clients while providing significant expertise in the technical nature of the services.
 
Our global sales structure is tailored to deliver quick responses on pricing, account ownership requests, and general assistance with client requests and training. This structure is built on our foundational values of teamwork and responsiveness. Our global sales force pursues opportunities in a wide range of geographies and is not confined by the traditional territorial structure that competitors offer. This allows us to maximize relationships and revenue.


Sales leadership encourages representatives around the world to collaborate. A global sales strategy initiative has been implemented to facilitate communication between teams on shared major accounts, which includes the coordination of regular calls and information sharing on key accounts. Most law firms have multiple buyers, and this model maximizes our ability to increase penetration.
 
Sales executives are encouraged to act as their own entrepreneurs, backed by the support of seasoned sales leadership and a global sales operations team. The sales operations team assists the sales team with all client requests including conflict checks, Salesforce data entry, estimate creation, and generation of client agreements and work orders. This global support team allows the sales representatives to focus on what they do best— generating new business and maintaining existing client relationships. Our global sales structure and sales operations teams deliver quick responses to representatives and clients, flexible pricing models, and simplified matter initiation, giving us a competitive advantage in a fast-paced industry.
 
Marketing
 
We focus on connecting with our clients through our marketing team. Our marketing campaigns are developed internally and are focused on our mantra, the “KLD Difference. One KLD.” and our “Proprietary Powerhouse” technology. We advertise in a wide variety of trade publications and at sports and entertainment events. We also sponsor a variety of events, seminars, and conferences around the world. We operate 38 global websites, which highlight our leadership, products, services, technology, industry experience, press clippings, and our community contributions. Holding true to our values, we are heavily focused on charitable donations and community work, which are highlighted on our “KLD Community” website page. We also have several video advertising campaigns which are shared via YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Additionally, we own the “ediscovery.com” domain and believe that a continued emphasis on strategic digital marketing and search engine optimization helps KLDiscovery capture significant internet search results on eDiscovery.
Research and Development
 
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and scaling of our proprietary technology infrastructure. We believe that our continued investment in research and development, including hiring top engineering talent, is critical for us to provide a leading and differentiated ecosystem that can tackle the industry’s most complex data problems. Additionally, our application development process is informed by the continuous feedback we receive from our own service providers, as well as long-term clients who are looking for a better and more secure solution.
 
Our research and development team is based across the United States and European Union, primarily in Minnesota and Poland, with an expanding presence in Greece. As of December 31, 2022, we had 172 employees in our research and development department.
 
Our competition
 
We believe the eDiscovery and information governance market is bifurcated, highly fragmented, competitive, and evolving. We encounter competition from different software and service providers with various business model and product offerings that overlap with parts of our solutions, including:
 
•Software providers
 oLegacy on-premise software—Providers such as Nuix, Open Text, Relativity, RELX and Thomson Reuters, as well as many other smaller software companies.
 oCloud software—Providers such as Everlaw, Logikcull, Relativity through its RelativityOne product offering, and Reveal Data Corporation, as well as many other smaller software companies. CS DISCO, another cloud-native software provider, is also offering a mix of software and human professional services.
 
•Service providers
 oLegal services—Providers such as Consilio, Epiq Systems, FTI Consulting, the legal services divisions of large professional services firms such as Deloitte, Ernst and Young, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, as well as an array of smaller regional and local legal services providers. Certain law firms also provide in-house eDiscovery solutions and legal document review services to their clients that may compete with our solutions.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry include:
 
•breadth of offering;
 •client service and support;
 •level of client satisfaction
 •solution features and capabilities;
 •flexibility of solution deployment;
 •ease of access, deployment, implementation, and use;
 •breadth of geographic coverage;
 •accuracy, quality and depth of services offered;
 •quality and use of technology;
 •cost and predictability of costs;
 •security; and
 •client relationships and brand loyalty.
 
There are many small regional eDiscovery providers which may have a few captive relationships but lack the resources or scale to compete for meaningful work. Likewise, most of the global and national providers lack a comprehensive proprietary platform to complement their scale and resources. We believe we are distinctly positioned with an ideal complement of global reach, scale of resources, and proprietary technology to address almost any client need.
 
Additionally, we serve the data recovery market, which is highly fragmented and generally competitive. Clients choose vendors based on brand awareness and reputation, speed, price, and security. Our competitors in the data recovery market include Drivesavers, Gillware Data Recovery, Stellar Data Recovery, Disk Doctors, Digital Data Recovery DDC, and Myung Information Technologies.
 
We also compete in the legal hold market with companies such as Exterro, OpenText, ZApproved, and Zylab.
 
Intellectual property
 
We own a range of issued, registered and applied for intellectual property rights across the world, primarily trademarks and patents.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 158 trademark registrations globally and had 44 trademark applications at various stages in the application process. Our material trademarks are either registered or are the subject of pending applications for registrations in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office and various non-U.S. jurisdictions (but with a focus on the European Union, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, Australia, China, Singapore and Hong Kong). We use “KLDiscovery”, “Ontrack”, and “Ibas” as our primary corporate trademarks. The trademark “KLDiscovery” has proceeded to registration in Australia, China, Brazil, the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, we have applied to register “Nebula,” the brand name for
our proprietary eDiscovery platform, in our key markets and, to date, applications have proceeded to registration in the United States, Japan, the European Union, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Brazil.
 
We use “Kroll Ontrack” and “KrolLDiscovery” subject to a license from Kroll, LLC. In October 2021, we executed an agreement with Kroll, LLC, which amended the existing trademark license agreement, and provided that our rights to use the Kroll Ontrack and KrolLDiscovery trade names will expire on October 29, 2023. Part of the terms of the amended trademark license are that the licensed marks will be withdrawn and/or cancelled upon our instructions and Kroll, LLC will be prevented from using and/or registering the same or similar marks. This agreement was a triggering event which resulted in an evaluation of impairment of our Kroll Ontrack and KrolLDiscovery tradenames capitalized as part of our 2016 Kroll Ontrack acquisition. See Note 1—Organization, business and summary of significant accounting policies to our audited consolidated financial statements.
 
We are the registered owner of 573 domain names including our key domains used to promote our activities, namely: kldiscovery.com, ontrack.com, compiled.com, and ibas.com (along with many local variants of these main domain names). We are also the registered owner of ediscovery.com, which we believe helps capture significant internet traffic. Information contained on these websites or linked therein or otherwise connected thereto does not constitute part of nor is it incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the inclusion of these website addresses is an inactive textual reference only.
 
We own the copyright of many of our business software and tools as they have been created by employees in the course of their employment. These include the Nebula and EDR platforms, the PMDB Database (internal job tracking tool), Service Cloud (data recovery portal), PowerControls, and the various Relativity applications to enhance the license of standard Relativity platform services.
 
We have 18 patent registrations, including granted patents for our Nebula offering.
 
Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 2,434 employees. This total includes 1,163 regular employees and 1,271 temporary contingent employees who are employed on a project basis to work on active managed review matters. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe employee relations are good.
 
The skills, experience, and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency.
 
We strive to hire employees who adhere to the following cultural values:
 •Team—We beat with one heart and succeed by working together
 •Humility—No one person is above the team. Our company, clients, and teammates come before personal agenda
 •Availability and connectivity—Responsiveness and efficient communication are key
 •Frugality—Smart spending leads to greater return on investment
 •Creativity—We think outside the box and always try to improve process
 •Urgency and Productivity—Every day is an opportunity to work smarter, faster, and harder
 •Vigilance (courage / honesty)—Management must value and be responsive to employee and client feedback, competitive information, and well-designed process improvement
 •Singular Focus—Laser focus on performing your job to the best of your ability
 •Recruiting—We hire smart, hungry and humble employees
 •Client focus—Clients are our lifeline, and their satisfaction is our #1 priority


Annual employee training is used to reinforce these values across our global employee base. These trainings cover topics related to ethics, environment, health and safety, cyber-security, and emergency responses.
 
We believe that an inclusive culture where all employees feel valued and engaged makes KLDiscovery a desirable place to work, helps us to attract key talent and retain employees as they grow in their careers and fosters an environment that enhances each individual’s productivity and professional satisfaction. KLDiscovery has an Inclusion & Diversity program focused on commitment to inclusion and diversity through our Culture & Environment, Business & Technology, and Community & Partnerships. The program includes employee-led Business Resource Groups dedicated to promoting and integrating inclusion and diversity throughout the organization.

As of December 31, 2022, not including contingent employees who were employed temporarily to work on active managed review matters, our employees, including those employed by region, were located as follows:
 


Region | Percentage
North America | 67% 
Europe, Middle East, and Africa | 29% 
Asia Pacific | 4% 

 
In order to comply with local employee-related laws, we do not require our employees to disclose their race and ethnicity. As of December 31, 2022, based on self-reported information of approximately 66% of our U.S. based employees, and not including contingent employees who were employed temporarily to work on active managed review matters, our gender and ethnicity demographics were as follows:
 

Gender | Employee Percentage
Female | 33% 
Male | 67% 
Ethnicity | Employee Percentage
Asian | 8.7% 
Black / African American | 5.3% 
Hispanic / Latin | 6.5% 
Multiracial, Native American and Pacific Islander | 3.4% 
White | 76.0% 

 
Government regulation
 
We collect, store, transmit, use, disclose and otherwise process, which we refer to herein as “Process” or “Processing,” data that was collected from and about persons or their devices, including personal information, which is defined broadly by relevant privacy and cybersecurity laws, and other regulated or confidential client data. In addition to terms in our contractual arrangements with clients, there are numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and directives regarding privacy and the Processing and protection of such personal information and client data, the scope of which is continually evolving and subject to differing interpretations. We and our clients must comply with such laws, regulations and directives and we and our clients may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties and fines, for our failure to comply.
 
For example, on May 25, 2018, GDPR replaced the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC with respect to the Processing of personal information in the European Union. The GDPR imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal information (including non-E.U. processors who Process personal data on behalf of E.U. controllers), including, for example, more robust internal accountability controls, a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information and additional obligations when we contract with third parties in connection with the Processing of personal information. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable
national data protection laws of the E.U. member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. Complying with the GDPR has required us to implement additional internal processes to seek to ensure that we Process personal information in a compliant way and we have regularly re-drafted all our standard contracts to meet specific articles within the GDPR and new interpretations of the GDPR. As we continue to operate under the GDPR, compliance may become onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 
In addition, following Brexit (the process by which the United Kingdom left the European Union), the United Kingdom enacted the Data Protection Act 2018, which implemented legislation similar to the GDPR, referred to as the UK GDPR, which provides for fines of up to the greater of £17.5 million (sterling) or 4% of global turnover.
 
Furthermore, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from the EEA to the United States. For example, on July 16, 2020, the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which allowed for the transfer of personal data from the US to the EU, was invalidated by the European Court of Justice, or CJEU, and this was followed on September 8, 2020 by the invalidation of the equivalent Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework. Three of our group companies were accredited under the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States. Although the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal information transfer mechanism) upon which we rely for intra group transfers of personal information (and which is the most widely used transfer mechanism by our clients), it made clear that use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals. Additionally, the European Data Protection Board (assigned by the European Commission to oversee data privacy in the EU) has issued guidance concerning data transfers following these CJEU decisions which places a higher burden on compliance for data transfers. The European Union has re-issued the standard contractual clauses which must be used for all new personal data transfers after September 27, 2021 (with the sunset date for existing personal data transfers expiring on December 27, 2022 meaning that any existing personal data transfers were subject to the new standard contractual clauses by this date). The European Commission has just announced a new Data Privacy Framework with the United States, and this may eventually replace the E.U. – U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

The United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union has also imposed different requirements on personal data transfers with the introduction of the International Data Transfer Agreement and the Addendum to the E.U. standard contractual clauses in March 2022. Given these legal developments and the United Kingdom's potential long-term divergence from E.U. law, long-term validity of United Kingdom data protection measures remains uncertain, and we could be impacted by changes in law, including any future review of transfer mechanisms by the European courts or any supervisory authorities, which could require us to undertake substantial additional review of agreements on a going forward basis. If further legal bases for transferring personal information from Europe (or even the United Kingdom) to the United States are invalidated, or if we are unable to transfer personal information between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our solutions or could adversely affect our financial results.
 
The California Consumer Protection Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, introduced the most stringent data privacy laws in the United States to date, though several other states have passed or are in the process of passing laws and regulations governing privacy of their residents. Among other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California residents and affords such residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information and certain opt-out rights for sales of personal information. The CCPA includes a private right of action for certain data breaches, with potential for severe statutory damages. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or the CPRA. The CPRA further expands the CCPA, imposing additional data privacy compliance requirements that may impact our business, and establishing a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements. In addition, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, creating the second comprehensive U.S. state privacy law, which took effect on January 1, 2023, and Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act, which will go into effect partially on July 1, 2023; both laws are substantively similar to the CCPA and the CPRA in many respects, but also include their
own unique compliance requirements. Certain aspects of the interpretation and enforcement of these laws remain uncertain as regulating bodies in these jurisdictions continue to work out applicability and scope of the laws and regulations. Comprehensive privacy laws have also been proposed in several other states and at the federal level. The effects of such laws could be significant and may require us to modify our data Processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, many laws and regulations relating to privacy and the Processing and protection of certain types of data are subject to varying degrees of enforcement and new and changing interpretations by courts. Companies like ours that operate on a national and international scale are responsible for monitoring and complying with the patchwork of state requirements in the United States as well as other jurisdictions worldwide.
 
Furthermore, any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with or make effective modifications to our policies, or to comply with any federal, state or international privacy, data-retention or data-protection-related laws, regulations, orders or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (including clients), a loss of client confidence, damage to our brand and reputation or a loss of clients, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, various federal, state, and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention and data-protection issues, including laws or regulations mandating disclosure to domestic or international law enforcement bodies, which could adversely impact our business, our brand or our reputation with clients. For example, some countries have adopted laws mandating that personal information regarding clients in their country be maintained solely in their country. Having to maintain local data centers and redesign product, service, and business operations to limit personal information Processing to within individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly and require that we establish a physical presence in a country or region where we otherwise may not have opened any facilities.
 
Additionally, in connection with some of our product initiatives, we expect that our clients may increasingly use our cloud services to Process personal information and other regulated data. While we include privacy or information security obligations in our contracts, new jurisdictional legal requirements, in particular those from the E.U., may make it so that we will be unable to do business without more stringent obligations. Any failure by us to timely amend client contracts to conform to changing data protection laws, or to comply with our posted privacy policies, other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, or the privacy or information security commitments contained in our contracts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, including individual rights of action, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon any liability we may have as a result of lawsuits or regulatory actions could also harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Furthermore, although we market and sell products to our clients to help them comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and directives, including the GDPR, our clients are responsible for ensuring they are in compliance with such laws, regulations and directives. Any failure by our clients to comply could result in significant consequences to them, including penalties and fines, and despite the existence of contractual exclusions and marketing disclaimers which make their responsibility for their own compliance clear, our clients may file claims or seek indemnification from us, which may result in reputational harm and require us to expend time, effort and costs to defend such claims or respond to indemnification requests. Our standard terms of business include caps on liability, where legally permitted, but these may be challenged by clients and disapplied by a court in any judgment against the Company.
 
In addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups or other third parties may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to our clients or us. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, directives or industry practices regarding the Processing of our clients’ data, or regarding the manner in which the legal basis for Processing, such as express or implied consent of clients for the Processing of such data, is obtained, could require us to modify our solutions and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new solutions and features that make use of the data that our clients voluntarily share with us. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to clients or other third parties or our privacy-related legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized access to, use, release or transfer of personal information or other client data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, negative media attention or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our clients to lose trust in us, which would have an adverse
effect on our reputation and business. Our clients may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a mobile device that may be lost or stolen, resulting in unauthorized access to their data and creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. Additionally, if employees or third parties that we work with, such as contractors, vendors or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our clients’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.
 
We have expanded our involvement in the delivery and provision of cloud computing through business alliances with various providers of cloud computing services and software and expect to continue to do so in the future. The application of U.S. and international data privacy laws to cloud computing vendors is uncertain, and our existing contractual provisions may prove to be inadequate to protect us from claims for data loss or regulatory noncompliance made against us resulting from the failures of cloud computing providers which we may partner with. While we do seek to limit our liability for such claims in our contractual agreements with clients, the failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations by our business partners who provide cloud computing services could have a material adverse effect on our business. Cloud computing providers typically do not offer terms that match the commercial terms sought by our clients. We will need to modify our procurement processes in response to changing client and regulatory demands.

Implications of being an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined under Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These include:
 
•reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements;
 •exemption from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments; and
 •exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period set forth in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period and, as a result, we are not subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that comply with new or revised standards on a non-delayed basis.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2024 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is greater than $700.0 million as of the last business day of our second quarter of that fiscal year, and (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a smaller reporting company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. These include:
 
•presenting only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our annual reports on Form 10-K and registration statements; and
 •reduced narrative disclosure obligations, particularly with respect to executive compensation, in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements.
 
Further, if we are a smaller reporting company with less than $100 million in annual revenue, we would be exempt from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, similar to emerging growth companies. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of a fiscal year on which either (i) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is $250 million or more as of such date, or (ii) both our annual revenue was $100 million or more during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates is $700 million or more as of such date. However, we may continue relying on the reduced reporting requirements of smaller reporting companies through the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year in which we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company. Therefore, we may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company.
 
We have elected to take advantage of certain of these reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and expect to take advantage of reduced disclosure obligations in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, while we remain an emerging growth company or smaller reporting company, as applicable. If we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than what you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you may have equity interests.
