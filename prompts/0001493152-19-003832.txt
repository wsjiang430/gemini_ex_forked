The Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”) is about the transformation of any physical object into a digital data solution. Once you attach a sensor to it, a physical object (whether a tiny one like a pill that goes through your body, or a very large one like a plane or building) starts functioning a lot like any other digital solution – it emits data about its usage, location and state; it can be tracked, controlled, personalized and upgraded remotely; and, when coupled with all the progress in Big Data and artificial intelligence, the digital solution can become intelligent, predictive, collaborative and in some cases semi-autonomous.

According to Gartner Group, there will be over 21 billion “things” connected to the internet by 2020, or in other words, 3 things per each human being on earth. The Gartner Group reported that the market size for services is expected to be $235 billion in 2016, with the majority coming from business services. Wintergreen Research (2016) more conservatively estimates the commercial IIoT market at $16.3B in 2016 and reaching $185.9B by 2023.
 
OmniM2M is focused on the IIoT, thereby helping commercial customers increase their return on investment in their facilities. Applications such as video surveillance, smart meters, digital health monitors and a host of other services are creating new requirements and opportunities for new IIoT devices and solutions.
 
OmniM2M historically has provided bundled solutions of hardware, software, connectivity, applications and analytics to address targeted problems in refrigeration, pest control and tank monitoring. OmniM2M’s unique solutions can be deployed rapidly and provides considerable Return on Investment (ROI) benefits immediately by saving up to 25% of an employee’s time or meeting of corporate compliance goals). OmniM2M has deployed solutions that are currently being used by several customers with positive results. Over the past two years, OmniM2M has been primarily billing the software component. They provide the solution that at times may require minor purchases of hardware to complete the service.
 
Historically, OmniM2M has performed the services (“solutions”) in the following industries: Refrigeration, Pest Control, and Tank Monitoring. As noted, in the past few years, a majority of the OmniM2M services have occurred in the refrigeration sector. A majority of these services were software related.
 
OmniM2M Refrigeration Solution
 
The OmniM2M Refrigeration Solution includes a piece of hardware (the size is about that of a smart phone) that is deployed in the refrigeration units. It has a cellular connection to the OmniM2M software in the cloud. The solution tracks the temperature and alerts the user via email and/or text if there is a change in the temperature. When the health inspector performs its assessment, the customer can simply print or email the data using the OmniM2M reporting feature solution. In addition to monitoring food, the OmniM2M solutions can potentially prevent food poisoning outbreaks by safely monitoring food and equipment to their optimum temperatures.
Customer Pain Points
 
The typical refrigeration customer (restaurant/meat distributor/catering) frequently has issues with its equipment breaking down, meeting compliance requirements and ensuring product freshness. Aging equipment typically results in significant financial losses when the asset fails. The typical restaurant has a regulatory requirement to log the temperature in its refrigeration units four (4) times per day. This data is compiled manually by employees who check each unit and log the temperature. Since it’s a manual process, there is generally no monitoring performed outside of business hours. Assets tend to fail outside of normal hours when employees are not on location and the issue or failure is not detected.

OmniM2M Pest Control Solution
 
By installing a small sensor on the pest trap, the OmniM2M Pest Control Solution notifies a control technician when a pest has been caught in a trap. This notification enables the user to check the trap when it has caught the targeted vermin. Our OmniM2M Pest Control Solution also complies with state and federal laws by sending daily status reports of the active traps.
 
This solution results in a saving of up to 2 hours of employee time per day and reduces driving time on average, by approximately 50 miles per day.
 
OmniM2M Tank Monitoring Solution
 
By installing a small sensor in any large tank (that holds liquids), the OmniM2M Tank Monitoring Solution notifies the user electronically when the tank needs to be refilled. This solution saves considerable expense of unplanned truck rolls for refilling the tanks.

The Competitive Environment
 
The IIoT marketplace is very fragmented marketplace comprised of a few dozen Fortune 50 companies offering development platforms and networking infrastructure; about 100 Fortune 1000 companies offering a range of products, services and solutions across multiple industry segments; and at least 100 smaller start-up companies and publicly traded companies that offer a small number of products, services and solutions in targeted industry segments.
 
We believe that OmniM2M will succeed by focusing on a small number of industry segments – such as Transportation, Energy (Oil & Gas), and Resource Management – and by offering data analytics and systems integration services that complement the sale of IIoT devices to enterprise customers.

TransportIQ launched its business with owner operators and has begun to hire drivers, thereby improving gross profits and service reliability. It plans to grow its operations by incrementally adding new third-party logistics and supply chain management customers, owner operators, and contract drivers.
 
TransportIQ plans to differentiate itself from traditional carriers through the adoption of new technologies that can help TransportIQ create competitive advantages in the transportation industry. The first step will be integrating OmniM2M’s Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) tracking devices into van trailers for monitoring and reporting location, weight, and temperature of loads.
