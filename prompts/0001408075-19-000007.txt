Paperboard Mills and Folding Carton Facilities
The Company produces paperboard at its mills; prints, cuts, folds, and glues (“converts”) the paperboard into folding cartons and containers at its converting plants; and designs and manufactures specialized, proprietary packaging machines that package bottles and cans and, to a lesser extent, non-beverage consumer products. The Company also installs its packaging machines at customer plants and provides support, service and advanced performance monitoring of the machines.
The Company offers a variety of laminated, coated and printed packaging structures that are produced from its CUK, CRB and SBS, as well as other grades of paperboard that are purchased from third-party suppliers.
Below is the production at each of the Company’s paperboard mills during 2018: 

Location | Product | # of Machines | 2018 Net Tons Produced
West Monroe, LA | CUK | 2 | 878,008 
Macon, GA | CUK | 2 | 686,694 
Kalamazoo, MI | CRB | 2 | 497,901 
Battle Creek, MI | CRB | 2 | 210,247 
Middletown, OH | CRB | 1 | 173,571 
East Angus, Québec | CRB | 1 | 93,849 
Texarkana, TX | SBS | 2 | 650,964 
Augusta, GA | SBS | 2 | 508,238 
West Monroe, LA | Corrugated Medium | 1 | 120,281 

The Company consumes most of its coated board output in its converting operations, which is an integral part of the customer value proposition. In 2018, approximately 87% of mill sales of CUK and CRB and 37% of SBS, or 71% of combined mill sales of CUK, CRB and SBS, was consumed internally, respectively.
CUK Production.  The Company is the largest of four worldwide producers of CUK. CUK is manufactured from pine-based wood fiber and is a specialized high-quality grade of coated paperboard with excellent wet and dry tear strength characteristics and printability for high resolution graphics that make it particularly well-suited for a variety of packaging applications. Both wood and recycled fibers are pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics. 
CRB Production.  The Company is the largest North American producer of CRB. CRB is manufactured entirely from recycled fibers, primarily old corrugated containers (“OCC”), doubled-lined kraft cuttings from corrugated box plants (“DLK”), old newspapers (“ONP”), and box cuttings. The recycled fibers are re-pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics.
SBS Production. The Company is one of the largest North American producers of SBS.  SBS is manufactured from bleached pine and hardwood-based wood fiber and is the highest quality paperboard substrate with excellent wet and dry strength characteristics and superior printability for high-end packaging. Both wood and recycled fibers are pulped, formed on paper machines, and clay-coated to provide an excellent printing surface for superior quality graphics and appearance characteristics.  SBS is also coated with polyethylene resin for wet strength liquid and food packaging end uses. 
Corrugated Medium.  The Company manufactures corrugated medium for internal use and sale in the open market. Corrugated medium is combined with linerboard to make corrugated containers. 
The Company converts CUK, CRB and SBS, as well as other grades of paperboard, into cartons and containers at converting plants the Company operates in various locations globally, including a converting plant associated with the Company's joint venture in Japan, contract converters and at licensees outside the U.S. The converting plants print, cut, fold and glue paperboard into cartons and containers designed to meet customer specifications.
Joint Venture
The Company, through its GPIL subsidiary, is a party to a joint venture, Rengo Riverwood Packaging, Ltd. (in Japan), in which it holds a 50% ownership interest. The joint venture agreement covers CUK supply, use of proprietary carton designs and marketing and distribution of packaging systems.

Marketing and Distribution
The Company markets its products principally to multinational beverage, food, QSR, and other well-recognized consumer product companies. The beverage companies include Anheuser-Busch, Inc., MillerCoors LLC, PepsiCo, Inc. and The Coca-Cola Company, among others. Consumer product customers include Kraft Heinz Company, General Mills, Inc., Nestlé USA, Inc., Kellogg Company, HAVI Global Solutions, LLC and Kimberly-Clark Corporation, among others. QSR customers include McDonald's, Wendy's, Panda Express, Dairy Queen, Chipotle, Panera and Kentucky Fried Chicken, among others. The Company also sells paperboard in the open market to independent and integrated paperboard converters.
Distribution of the Company’s principal products is primarily accomplished through sales offices in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and, to a lesser degree, through broker arrangements with third parties.
During 2018, the Company did not have any one customer that represented 10% or more of its net sales.
Competition
Although a relatively small number of large competitors hold a significant portion of the paperboard packaging market, the Company’s business is subject to strong competition. The Company and WestRock Company ("WestRock") are the two major CUK producers in the U.S. Internationally, The Klabin Company in Brazil and Stora Enso in Sweden produce similar grades of paperboard.
In non-beverage consumer packaging and foodservice, the Company’s paperboard competes with WestRock CUK, as well as CRB and SBS from numerous competitors, and internationally, folding boxboard and white-lined chip. There are a large number of producers in the paperboard markets. Suppliers of paperboard compete primarily on the basis of price, strength and printability of their paperboard, quality and service.
In beverage packaging, cartons made from CUK compete with substitutes such as plastics and corrugated packaging for packaging glass or plastic bottles, cans and other primary containers. Although plastics and corrugated packaging may be priced lower than CUK, the Company believes that cartons made from CUK offer advantages over these materials in areas such as distribution, brand awareness, carton designs, package performance, package line speed, environmental friendliness and design flexibility.
Raw Materials
The paperboard packaging produced by the Company comes from pine and hardwood trees and recycled fibers. Pine pulpwood, hardwood pulp, paper and recycled fibers (including DLK, OCC and ONP) and energy used in the manufacture of paperboard, as well as poly sheeting, plastic resins and various chemicals used in the coating of paperboard, represent the largest components of the Company’s variable costs of paperboard production.
For the West Monroe, LA, Macon, GA, Texarkana, TX, and Augusta, GA mills, the Company relies on private landowners and the open market for all of its pine and hardwood pulp and recycled fiber requirements, supplemented by clippings that are obtained from its converting operations. The Company believes that adequate supplies from both private landowners and open market fiber sellers currently are available in close proximity to meet its fiber needs at these mills.
 The paperboard grades produced at the Kalamazoo, MI, Battle Creek, MI, Middletown, OH and East Angus, Quebec mills are made from 100% recycled fiber. The Company procures its recycled fiber from external suppliers and internal converting operations. The market price of each of the various recycled fiber grades fluctuates with supply and demand. The Company’s internal recycled fiber procurement function enables the Company to pay lower prices for its recycled fiber needs given the Company’s highly fragmented supplier base. The Company believes there are adequate supplies of recycled fiber to serve its mills.
In North America, the Company also converts a variety of other paperboard grades, in addition to paperboard that is supplied to its converting operations from its own mills. The Company purchases such paperboard requirements, including additional CRB and SBS, from outside vendors. The majority of external paperboard purchases are acquired through long-term arrangements with other major industry suppliers. The Company's European converting plants consume CUK supplied from the Company's mills and also convert other paperboard grades such as white-lined chip and folding box board purchased from external suppliers. 
Energy
Energy, including natural gas, fuel oil and electricity, represents a significant portion of the Company’s manufacturing costs. The Company has entered into contracts designed to manage risks associated with future variability in cash flows and price risk related to future energy cost increases for a portion of its natural gas requirements at its U.S. mills. The Company’s hedging program for natural gas is discussed in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Backlog
Orders from the Company’s principal customers are manufactured and shipped with minimal lead time. The Company did not have a material amount relating to backlog orders at December 31, 2018 or 2017.
Seasonality
The Company’s net sales, income from operations and cash flows from operations are subject to moderate seasonality, with demand usually increasing in the late spring through early fall due to increases in demand for beverage and food products. 
Research and Development
The Company’s research and development team works directly with its sales, marketing and consumer insights personnel to understand long-term consumer and retailer trends and create relevant new packaging. These innovative solutions provide customers with differentiated packaging to meet customer needs. The Company’s development efforts include, but are not limited to, extending the shelf life of customers’ products; reducing production and waste costs; enhancing the heat-managing characteristics of food packaging; improving the sturdiness and compression strength of packaging to meet store display needs; and refining packaging appearance through new printing techniques and materials.
Sustainability represents one of the strongest trends in the packaging industry and the Company focuses on developing more sustainable and eco-friendly manufacturing processes and products. The Company’s strategy is to combine sustainability with innovation to create new packaging solutions for its customers. 
 For more information on research and development expenses see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein under “Item 8., Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Culture and Employees
The Company’s corporate vision — Inspired packaging. A world of difference. — and values of integrity, respect, accountability, relationships and teamwork guide employee behavior, expectations and relations. The Company’s ongoing efforts to build a high-performance culture and improve the manner in which work is done across the Company includes a significant focus on continuous improvement utilizing processes like Lean Sigma and Six Sigma.
