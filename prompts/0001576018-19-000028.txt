Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a holding company domiciled in Bermuda. Through our reinsurance subsidiaries, we provide specialty property and casualty reinsurance products to insurance and reinsurance companies on a worldwide basis. Our goal is to deliver attractive equity returns to our shareholders by combining profitable reinsurance underwriting with superior investment

management provided by Third Point LLC, our investment manager and the investment manager of TP Fund. We believe that our reinsurance and investment strategy differentiates us from our competitors.
Our reinsurance strategy is to be highly opportunistic and disciplined. During periods of extremely competitive or soft reinsurance market conditions, we intend to be selective with regard to the amount and type of reinsurance we write and conserve our risk-taking capital for periods when market conditions are more favorable to us from a pricing and terms and conditions perspective. 
Our senior management team has significant senior leadership and underwriting experience in the reinsurance industry. We believe that our experience and longstanding relationships with our insurance and reinsurance company clients, senior reinsurance brokers, insurance regulators and rating agencies are an important competitive advantage. 
Substantially all of our investable assets are managed by Third Point LLC, which is wholly owned by Daniel S. Loeb, one of our founding shareholders. Third Point LLC is an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in New York, managing $14.0 billion in assets as of December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for details on the investment account structure change that occurred in 2018. 
We were incorporated on October 6, 2011 and completed our initial capitalization transaction in December 2011 with $784.3 million of equity capital, and commenced underwriting business on January 1, 2012. Both of our operating subsidiaries have an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating from A.M. Best Company, Inc., or A.M. Best. 
In August 2012, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, Third Point Re Marketing (UK) Limited (“TPRUK”). In May 2013, TPRUK was licensed as an insurance intermediary by the UK Financial Conduct Authority.
In August 2013, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of 24,832,484 common shares. Our common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “TPRE”.
In February 2015, we began reinsurance operations in the United States through Third Point Re USA, a Bermuda company licensed as a Class 4 insurer and a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Third Point Re (USA) Holdings Inc. (“TPRUSA”). TPRUSA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Third Point Re (UK) Holdings Ltd., a private company limited by shares organized under the laws of England and Wales and our direct wholly owned subsidiary. Third Point Re USA provides reinsurance products that are substantially similar to the reinsurance products provided by Third Point Re. Third Point Re USA’s U.S. presence is a strategic component of our overall growth strategy.
Segment Information
We manage our business on the basis of one operating segment: Property and Casualty Reinsurance. Non-underwriting income and expenses, presented as a reconciliation to our consolidated results, include: net investment income (loss), certain general and administrative expenses related to corporate activities, interest expense, foreign exchange (gains) losses and income tax (expense) benefit. 
Reinsurance Strategy
Our current reinsurance strategy is to build a portfolio that generates margins commensurate with the amount of risk assumed, by targeting sub-sectors of the market and specific situations where reinsurance capacity and alternatives may be constrained and/or we can leverage our underwriting and structuring expertise. To help lower our expected combined ratio, we have recently expanded into property catastrophe reinsurance and other higher margin event risk type covers. The level of volatility in our reinsurance portfolio will be determined by market conditions, but will typically be lower than that of most other reinsurance companies. 
Most of our gross written premium has historically been generated from larger customized reinsurance contracts that require significant interaction during the course of negotiations between the client, intermediaries and us. In these situations, we take a lead underwriting position, meaning that we establish the pricing and terms and conditions of the reinsurance contract. In certain instances, we will follow terms and conditions established by our competitors if we believe the opportunity meets our return threshold and helps us balance our reinsurance portfolio. In addition, with the 

 3
recent expansion into property catastrophe and other event risk reinsurance covers, the number of less customized, syndicated transactions will significantly increase.
We also write reinsurance contracts that provide protection against adverse development on loss reserves where we provide an incremental amount of additional coverage limit. We typically provide coverage where we agree with the client’s reserving practices and reserve levels or where we believe there are structural or contractual safeguards against reserve deterioration in place. While these transactions may be booked at, or slightly above, a 100% composite ratio (combined ratio before general and administrative expenses) and therefore do not initially generate underwriting income, they typically produce premiums and/or float equal to the reserves ceded at the inception of the contract. In some instances, the level of risk in the reserve cover contract or the risk mitigating features within the contract including limitations on the amount and timing of loss payments require us to account for the contract as a deposit liability contract. Using the deposit method of accounting, a deposit liability, rather than written premium, is initially recorded based upon the consideration received less any explicitly identified premiums or fees. In subsequent periods, the deposit liability is adjusted by calculating the effective yield on the deposit to reflect actual payments to date and future expected payments. 
The majority of our gross written premium is derived from a small number of large contracts and, as a result, individual renewals, non-renewals, cancellations or new business can have a significant impact on premiums recognized in a period. In addition, many of our quota share contracts are subject to significant judgment in the amount of premiums that we expect to recognize. Changes in premium estimates are recorded in the period they are determined and can significantly alter the expected value of a particular reinsurance contract. We also offer customized solutions to our clients, including some of the reserve covers, which are considered retroactive reinsurance contracts, on which we will not have a regular renewal opportunity. Furthermore, we record gross premiums written and earned for reserve covers at the inception of the contract. Together, these factors can impact the comparability of premiums written and earned from period to period and year over year. See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a breakdown of contracts that individually contributed more than 10% of total gross premiums written. 
We intend to manage our book of business by underwriting predominantly a mix of personal and commercial lines. We intend to increase our geographic spread over time; however, we expect that a majority of our reinsurance business will continue to be comprised of U.S. exposure. See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a breakdown of gross premiums written by domicile of ceding companies.
Many of our clients buy reinsurance from us for capital management purposes, primarily to increase their capacity to write insurance premium, maintain or improve their credit ratings from rating agencies, or to meet regulatory capital requirements. Many of our reinsurance contracts include structural and contractual features that limit the amount of risk assumed by the reinsurer, and therefore carry relatively lower expected margins compared to the excess of loss reinsurance and other more volatile forms of reinsurance in our portfolio. 
We have historically focused on lines of business and forms of reinsurance that have demonstrated more stable return characteristics and have limited our underwriting of property catastrophe risk. However, we have incrementally expanded the lines of business and forms of reinsurance on which we focus that have increased risk profiles where we believe the higher expected margins adequately compensate us for the increased risk. We have begun writing some excess of loss casualty covers in lines of business where we have historically assumed only quota share exposure. We also began expanding into new specialty lines of business in 2018 and started writing a modest amount of property catastrophe business in 2019. We plan to continue to expand into these lines of business and to evaluate and consider pursuing opportunities in other new lines of reinsurance business in 2019. During 2018, we added experienced senior underwriters with strong market relationships to our team and we will continue to expand our underwriting team in 2019. In addition, we may, from time to time, invest in managing general agents or other insurance vehicles as part of our ongoing strategy to leverage our underwriting and capital markets expertise to structure and offer capital alternatives in numerous forms and combinations, including equity, debt and reinsurance offerings.

Investment Strategy
During the period covered by this report, we transitioned to a new investment account structure, as previously disclosed in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018. For additional information, see “Change in Investment Account Structure” below, Item 9B. “Other Information” and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
We expect our overall investment exposures, returns, fees paid to Third Point LLC and Third Point Advisors LLC (“TP GP”) to be generally similar under the LPA and TP Fund IMA, each as defined below, compared to what would have been expected under the separate accounts managed under the JV Agreements, as defined below, assuming similar underlying investment portfolio returns and exposure levels. However, there can be no assurance of such results. 
Our investment strategy, through our investments in TP Fund, distinguishes us from most other reinsurers, who typically concentrate their investment portfolios on long-only, investment grade, shorter-term, fixed income securities. As implemented by the investment manager of TP Fund, Third Point LLC, TP Fund’s investment strategy is intended to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by deploying capital in both long and short investments with favorable risk/reward characteristics across select asset classes, sectors and geographies. Third Point LLC identifies investment opportunities via a bottom-up, value-oriented approach to single security analysis supplemented by a top-down view of portfolio and risk management. Third Point LLC seeks dislocations in certain areas of the capital markets or in the pricing of particular securities and supplements single security analysis with an approach to portfolio construction that includes sizing each investment based on upside/downside calculations, all with a view towards appropriately positioning and managing overall exposures. Dislocations in capital markets refer to any major movements in prices of the capital markets as a whole, certain segments of the market, or a specific security. If Third Point LLC has what it considers to be a differentiated view from the perceived market sentiment with respect to such movement, Third Point LLC may trade securities in our investment accounts based on that differentiated view. If the ultimate market reaction with respect to the event or movement ultimately proves to be closer to Third Point LLC’s original viewpoint, TP Fund may have investment gains as a result of the shift in market sentiment. Through its investment manager, Third Point LLC, TP Fund makes investments globally, in both developed and emerging markets, in all sectors, and in equity, credit, commodity, currency, options and other instruments. 
Third Point LLC has historically favored event-driven situations, in which it believes that a catalyst, either intrinsic or extrinsic, will unlock value or alter the lens through which the greater market values a particular investment. Third

Point LLC attempts to apply this event framework to each of its single security investments and this approach informs the timing and risk of each investment. 
Our cash and investment accounts include the collateral assets pertaining to letters of credit and trust accounts securing our obligations under certain reinsurance contracts. Collateral assets are managed by Third Point LLC under the investment management agreement (the “Collateral Assets IMA”), as discussed below under “Collateral Assets IMA”. The collateral assets pertaining to the trusts are invested pursuant to the eligible securities definition of each trust agreement, but typically limit the type of securities that can be invested to U.S. Treasury securities and highly rated sovereign debt. The collateral assets pertaining to collateral accounts securing letters of credit issued under secured letter of credit facilities are required to be held in cash.  Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further details.
Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment Products
Our underwriting team has extensive experience in underwriting many forms of property, casualty and specialty reinsurance products.  We offer reinsurance on a proportional basis where the reinsurer shares liabilities and premiums in a clearly defined proportion with the insurer and pays commissions to cover expenses and share in profitability. We also offer reinsurance on an excess of loss basis, where the reinsurer is paid a premium to cover losses after the insurer has retained a specified deductible. 
In the current market for property and casualty reinsurance, which remains highly competitive despite the aggregate catastrophe losses in recent years, we expect that we will continue to write prospective property, casualty and specialty reinsurance structured for surplus relief on a proportional basis, as well as opportunistic or higher margin business written on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.
We also write loss portfolio transfers, reserve covers and other forms of retrospective reserve covers, where we are able to leverage both our investment and underwriting capabilities.  We believe there is less competition for the type of reserve covers on which we focus. This is a result of the limited willingness of traditional reinsurers, who have historically experienced lower investment returns on investable assets backing reserves, to pursue these products which rely heavily on investment return to produce compelling economics. Margins on this business are determined through bilateral negotiations and comparing the cost of the reserve covers to non-reinsurance solutions such as raising additional equity or debt capital
We began expanding into new specialty lines of business in 2018 and started writing a portfolio of property catastrophe reinsurance incepting in 2019. We have expanded the lines of business and forms of reinsurance that we write to increase our risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to pursue business opportunities that are syndicated as well as those where we are the sole or primary reinsurer. 
While we expect to establish a diversified portfolio, our allocation of risk will vary based on our perception of the opportunities available in each line of business. Geographically, we do most of our business with insurer and reinsurer clients located in the United States of America, Bermuda, United Kingdom and Europe. The majority of our exposure emanates from the United States of America, United Kingdom and Europe. Moreover, our appetite for certain lines will fluctuate based upon market conditions and we may only offer or underwrite a limited range of lines in any given period. We intend to:

• | target markets where capacity and alternatives are underserved or capacity constrained;


• | employ strict underwriting discipline, while assembling a portfolio of diversified risks;


• | select reinsurance opportunities with expected favorable economics over the life of the contract; and


• | potentially offer lines and geographies that are not identified in this Form 10-K.

Through December 31, 2018, we wrote reinsurance contracts covering the following product lines: 
Property
This line of business primarily consists of homeowners’ and commercial reinsurance coverage. We also provide proportional and excess of loss reinsurance that has greater potential volatility, but with commensurately larger expected margins. With respect to risk aggregations, we seek to manage volatility via portfolio construction and client selection. 
Homeowners’
Homeowners’ reinsurance coverage combines various personal insurance protections, which can include losses occurring to one’s home, their contents, loss of use (including additional living expenses), or loss of other personal possessions of the homeowner, as well as liability insurance for accidents that may happen at covered homes or at the hands of the homeowners. 
Commercial
Commercial property coverage protects physical assets, including building structure and contents, from perils including fire, explosion, theft and catastrophic risks, such as hurricane, earthquake and flood. Commercial property reinsurance can include large commercial risks, such as office buildings, small commercial risks such as garden apartments, and highly technical or engineered risks, such as oil refineries. 
We provide property reinsurance in numerous forms covering both homeowners and commercial risks. Our proportional reinsurance that is structured to provide surplus relief generally covers homeowners and small commercial risks and are structured on a basis that limits the amount of catastrophic losses that can be recovered.  
Workers’ Compensation
Workers’ compensation reinsurance provides wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for the mandatory relinquishment of the employee’s right to sue the employer for negligence. While plans differ among jurisdictions, provisions can be made for payments in place of wages (functioning as a form of disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning as a form of health insurance), and benefits payable to dependents of workers killed during employment (functioning as a form of life insurance). General damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages for employer negligence are not generally available in workers’ compensation plans. Our approach to workers’ compensation is very selective and targets insurance companies that are very specialized within the workers’ compensation line and geographically focused. We offer both proportional and excess of loss reinsurance covering workers’ compensation risks and manage the volatility of this line of business by capping our per occurrence exposures. 
Auto
Personal automobile insurance is purchased for individually owned or leased cars designed to provide the insured with financial protection against bodily injury or physical damage resulting from traffic accidents and against liability that could arise from such occurrences. In addition, automobile insurance may offer financial protection against theft or damage of the vehicle from incidents other than collisions. In the United States, each state has different rules and regulations in place for compulsory coverage and the specific terms of automobile insurance policies will vary from company to company. In the United States, we generally focus on providing proportional reinsurance to small, single state and regional carriers that specialize in minimum financial responsibility limits required by their respective states. This business is often referred to as “non-standard” automobile business and was historically underserved by standard markets. More recently, however, standard companies have expanded their appetite for such business and it is written by a broad range of carriers. Outside of the United States, we also focus on the “non-standard” personal automobile segment in the United Kingdom. We have also seen an increase in opportunities that use technology platforms to gain market share in the standard automobile insurance market in the United States. We believe this sector will continue to grow, but we approach these opportunities with caution as there are often significant start-up operational risks that can manifest in poor early underwriting results. When we elect to pursue these opportunities, we try to take a leading role in structuring and incorporate features that attempt to limit losses resulting from start-up risk while building optionality for future reinsurance if, and when, these businesses become successful.

Like personal automobile insurance, commercial automobile insurance provides the insured with financial protection against bodily injury or physical damage to the automobile resulting from traffic accidents and against liability that could arise from such occurrences. It is purchased by businesses and provides financial protection for the insured business’ vehicles and drivers. While we have written minimal amounts of commercial automobile liability reinsurance to date, we have seen an increase in potential opportunities in the United States due to market dislocation. 
Other Casualty
Our Other Casualty line of business is comprised of casualty contracts exposed to more than one type of casualty risk. We write primarily proportional reinsurance in this sector, though we also provide excess of loss coverage. Typically, Other Casualty includes the following lines of business:
Professional Liability
Professional liability is a form of liability reinsurance that helps protect professional advisors and service-providing individuals and companies from bearing the full cost of defending against a negligence claim made by a client and damages awarded in a civil lawsuit. The coverage primarily addresses alleged failure to perform on the part of, financial loss caused by, and error or omission in the service provided by the policyholder. These are potential causes for legal action that would not be covered by a basic general liability reinsurance policy, which addresses more direct forms of harm.  The broad category of professional liability reinsurance includes the specific products of errors and omissions (“E&O”), directors and officers coverage (“D&O”), as well as several other products such as transactional liability insurance.
E&O coverage protects the insured against liability for committing inadequate work or negligent actions in performance of their professional duties. Generally, such policies are designed to cover financial losses rather than liability for bodily injury and property damage. E&O coverage was historically purchased by individuals with professional designations such as doctors, lawyers, architects, and engineers, but more recently other professions also purchase E&O coverage.
D&O coverage insures the legal liability of the individual directors and officers of the insured company for certain errors and omissions committed by them. In certain circumstances in which the insured company is not legally permitted to indemnify its directors or officers for a covered loss, the policy’s D&O coverage provides for insurance payments to be made directly to the directors or officers. Conversely, if the insured company indemnifies its directors or officers for their loss, the policy’s D&O coverage reimburses the insured company for those indemnification payments. In this way, the coverage insures against the insured company’s own “indemnification risk.”
There are two types of coverages available in professional liability insurance: occurrence and claims-made. An occurrence policy protects the insured from any covered incident that “occurs” during the policy period, regardless of when a claim is filed. An occurrence policy protects the insured from claims that are made even after the policy has been canceled, so long as the incident occurred during the period in which coverage was in effect. Claims-made policies provide coverage for claims only when a claim is reported during the period the policy is actually in force. Claims-made policies provide coverage so long as the insured continues to pay premiums for the initial policy and any subsequent renewals. A claims-made policy will cover claims after the coverage period only if the insured purchases extended reporting period or “tail” coverage.
Professional liability coverage is usually (but not always) written under a claims-made coverage form, and includes a duty to defend a lawsuit seeking damages covered by the policy.  
Transactional Liability 
Transactional liability coverage provides a solution for lowering risk for specific merger and acquisition transactions. The most common type of transactional liability insurance is representations and warranties liability insurance. Our exposure to this line is primarily from proportional reinsurance contracts with market professionals in this segment.
General Liability
General liability insurance policies are issued to business organizations to protect them against liability claims for bodily injury and property damage arising out of premises, operations, products, and completed operations. The premises 

 8
and operations portion of the coverage includes liability for injury or damage arising out of the insured's premises or out of the insured's business operations while such operations are in progress. The products and completed operations portion of the coverage includes liability arising out of the insured's products or business operations conducted away from the insured's premises once those operations have been completed or abandoned. The standard general liability policy also covers advertising and personal injury liability. These coverages include a duty to defend a lawsuit seeking damages covered by the policy.
Credit & Financial Lines
Credit & Financial Lines predominantly comprises reinsurance of mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance is an insurance policy that compensates lenders or investors for losses arising from the default of a mortgage loan. Mortgage insurance can refer to private mortgage insurance (“PMI”), mortgage life insurance or mortgage title insurance. We focus on PMI, which is normally required by lenders when a borrower’s down payment or equity is less than 20% of the loan value. Not all lenders will require PMI but those that follow the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines for home loan approval require PMI. As well as reinsuring private mortgage insurers in the United States, we assume exposure to the credit risk sharing transactions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both directly and by retrocession. We also write international mortgage reinsurance. In addition to mortgage reinsurance, policies classified as Credit & Financial Lines may include political risk, trade credit, surety, financial guarantee, residual value insurance and title insurance.
Other Specialty
The principal lines of business included in our other specialty line is comprised of:
Marine - covers damage to or losses of marine vessels and cargo, third-party liability for marine accidents and physical loss and liability from principally offshore energy properties. Coverage includes marine liability cover mainly related to the liabilities of ship-owners and port operators, including reinsurance of Protection and Indemnity Clubs (“P&I Clubs”).
Travel insurance - covers medical expenses, trip cancellation costs, lost luggage, flight accident and other losses incurred while traveling, either internationally or domestically.
Extended warranty insurance - compensates individuals or businesses for correction or repair necessary as a result of mechanical or electrical breakdown. Our reinsurance contracts cover motor vehicles, vans, trucks, construction equipment, consumer electronics, and agricultural equipment, and the coverage varies according to the product, the age and the usage. We currently write a limited amount of this coverage on a stand-alone basis and most of our exposure to this line of business emanates from multi-line contracts. The insurance is offered on a multi-year basis, generally with a maximum period of three years on risk, and can cover either new units after a period of warranty offered by the manufacturer or used units once the manufacturer’s warranty has expired. To date, all of the extended warranty insurance business we have written excludes manufacturer defect and product recall. 
Multi-line
Multi-line reinsurance is reinsurance of an underlying portfolio of several different types of insurance risks. We focus on multi-line reinsurance opportunities where we have expertise in the underlying lines of business or where the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contract minimize the volatility of the more difficult to analyze classes of business in the portfolio. Contracts that cover more than one line of business will be designated as multi-line even if a portion of the underlying business is covered by one of the lines of business listed above. These opportunities can be structured on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.

 9
Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts
Retroactive reinsurance contracts consist of loss portfolio transfers, adverse development covers and other forms of reserve reinsurance providing indemnification of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves with respect to past loss events. These contracts can include one or multiple lines of business and cover the potential for changes in estimates of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to loss events that have occurred in the past.
Marketing 
The majority of our business is sourced through reinsurance brokers. Broker distribution channels provide us with access to an efficient, variable cost, global distribution system without the significant time and expense that would be incurred in creating a wholly-owned distribution network. We believe that our financial strength rating, well known and respected management team, and responsive client service enhance our working relationships with clients and brokers. 
Our objective is to build long-term relationships with senior individuals at reinsurance brokers and with our clients. We meet frequently with brokers, senior representatives of existing clients and prospective clients, and encourage clients to visit our executive offices in order to help distinguish us and to develop mutually beneficial understandings of our respective businesses. As evidenced by rates of submission flow, open dialogue, and successful closing of targeted accounts, we believe we have successfully leveraged the underwriting experience and relationships of our management team. Reinsurance brokers receive a brokerage commission that is usually a percentage of gross premiums written. We seek to become the first choice of brokers and clients by providing: 

• | creative solutions that address the specific business needs of our clients;


• | rapid and substantive responses to structuring and pricing quote requests;


• | financial security; and


• | clear indication of risks we will and will not underwrite.

See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a breakdown of our premiums written by source that individually contributed more than 10% of total gross premiums written. 
We believe that the number of brokers with whom we do business will continue to expand over time, and by maintaining close working relationships with brokers, we are able to increase our chances of successfully growing and accessing a broader range of potential clients. 
Underwriting 
We have established a team of senior underwriters and actuaries to develop and manage our reinsurance business. We believe that their experience, industry presence and long-standing relationships will allow us to tailor our portfolio to specific market segments. Our approach to underwriting will allow us to deploy our capital in a variety of lines of business and to capitalize on opportunities that we believe offer favorable returns on equity over the long term. Our underwriters and actuaries have expertise in a number of lines of business and we will also look to outside consultants to help us with niche areas of expertise when we deem it appropriate. While our pricing and risk selection decisions are based primarily on our view of underwriting profit, we also consider investment income, where applicable and appropriate, in our underwriting and pricing of business. 
We generally apply the following underwriting management principles: 
Team Approach 
Each submission is assigned to an underwriter. If the program meets our underwriting criteria, the underwriter and pricing actuary evaluate the opportunity, determine the optimal structure where applicable, and price the deal. When capital is committed to any transaction, the underwriting team creates a deal analysis memorandum that highlights the key components of the proposed transaction and presents the proposed transaction to a senior group of staff including our senior executives and representatives of the underwriting, actuarial and finance teams. This group must agree that the transaction meets or exceeds our profitability expectations and requirements before we submit a binding proposal. 

 10
Actuarial Pricing 
We have developed proprietary actuarial models and also use several commercially available tools to assist in pricing our business. Our analysis considers the data and information provided by the potential cedent as well as relevant industry data, where appropriate. We use this cedent specific and industry data to develop our own point estimate of the expected losses under each potential contract. We also use a stochastic model to simulate a distribution of potential loss outcomes and the impact of any contractual features that may exist such as sliding scale ceding commissions or profit commissions. 
One key metric that we consider as a result of this process is the expected combined ratio on a particular transaction. We also consider the projected underwriting and economic results, inclusive of the opportunity cost of posting collateral, at various confidence levels with a specific focus on the likelihood and magnitude of adverse outcomes. As part of this process, we also specifically review each transaction to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to qualify for reinsurance accounting. The results of this pricing process are shared with the underwriter on a contract, and if a deal is bound, summary exhibits are attached to a memo summarizing the actuarial pricing analysis that was performed.
Act as Lead Underwriter 
Typically, one or two reinsurers will act as the lead or co-lead parties in developing and negotiating treaty pricing, terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts. We act as the lead underwriter for a significant portion of the premium that we underwrite. We believe that lead underwriting is a critically important factor in achieving long-term success, as lead underwriters have greater control of overall economics of their programs. In addition, we believe that reinsurers that lead contracts are generally solicited for a broader range of business and have greater access to attractive risks. However, for most of our excess of loss business, including our property catastrophe portfolio, which is relatively small by market premium standards, we generally act as a following reinsurer on syndicated terms and conditions.
Alignment of Interests 
We seek to ensure that the contracts we underwrite align our interests with our clients’ interest. Specifically, we may seek to: 

• | require our clients to maintain a meaningful risk position in their business;


• | pay our clients a commission based upon their actual expenses and offer an additional commission as an incentive based upon profitability;


• | include deficit carry-forward provisions in our multi-year contracts that allows us to potentially offset underwriting losses from one year to the next;


• | seek rights of first refusal on future business where we are providing solutions that help to build or grow a business;


• | charge the client a premium for reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage to the full amount reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment, which we refer to as a reinstatement premium;


• | require specific levels of rate increases on the underlying insurance policies; and


• | for the limited number of contracts on which we offer an interest credit on funds we hold, we credit interest income on actual cash received into a notional experience account whereby the experience account is credited to the ceding company at the maturity of the contract if underwriting results are realized as initially expected.

We believe these tools help us align our risk with the risk of the client and provide incentive to clients to manage our mutual interests. We also believe that aligning our interests with our client’s interests promotes profitability, accurate reporting of information, timely settling and management of claims, and limits the potential for disputes. Adjustments to profit commissions and other participating features are recorded in our financial statements based on our estimate of losses and the contractual provisions of the reinsurance contract. 
Detailed Underwriting Diligence 
We employ selective underwriting criteria in the contracts we choose to underwrite and for the contracts we lead or on which we have a material share, we spend a significant amount of time with our clients and brokers to evaluate the 

 11
risks and appropriately structure the contracts. In the majority of our transactions, as a leading or following reinsurer, we obtain significant amounts of information from our clients to conduct a thorough analysis. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we assess among other factors: 

• | the client’s and industry historical loss data and current market conditions;


• | the business purpose served by a proposed contract;


• | the client’s pricing and underwriting strategies;


• | the expected duration for claims to fully develop;


• | the geographic areas in which the client is doing business and its market share;


• | the reputation and financial strength of the client;


• | the reputation and expertise of the broker;


• | proposed contract terms and conditions; and


• | reports provided by independent industry specialists.

Retrocessional Coverage 
Retrocessional coverage consists of reinsurance purchased by a reinsurer from another reinsurer. While our reinsurance portfolio is focused on reinsurance of insurance companies, we also selectively write retrocessional coverage, the majority of which is in our property catastrophe portfolio. We have also historically purchased limited amounts of retrocessional protection to cover a portion of the risks that we reinsure on behalf of our clients. We purchased a small amount of retrocessional coverage in 2018 on specific accounts, and we may continue to do so in the future. From time to time, we consider purchases of retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to specifically reduce our property catastrophe exposure in certain reinsurance contracts that we write, to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to obtain additional underwriting capacity and to balance our underwriting portfolio. Additionally, retrocession can be used as a mechanism to share the risks and rewards of business written and therefore can be used as a tool to align our interests with those of our counterparties. 
Claims Management 
Our claims management process begins upon receipt of periodic contract reports from brokers or clients. These statements are reviewed on an individual basis, evaluated against our expectations and entered in our management system for portfolio analysis and reporting purposes. In addition to analyzing report statements and results, claims audits are performed on specific contracts based on results and management direction to ensure the clients are reporting and reserving their claims accurately and appropriately. 
Reserves
On a quarterly basis, our actuaries produce an actuarial central estimate of the gross and net loss reserves for all contracts bound as of the evaluation date. The reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis with regards to future investment income. The projections also include estimates of loss-sensitive contingent terms such as additional premium features, profit commissions and sliding scale ceding commissions. All calculations are done on a contract-by-contract basis and reflect the most recent premium and loss information provided by our cedents. 
In estimating our loss and loss adjustment reserves, it is necessary to project future loss and loss adjustment expense payments. Actual future loss and loss adjustment expenses will not develop exactly as projected and may, in fact, significantly vary from the projections. Further, the projections make no provision for extraordinary future emergence of new classes of losses or types of losses not sufficiently represented in our or the cedent’s historical database or which are not yet quantifiable.
See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information and details on our loss reserve development.

Collateral Arrangements and Letter of Credit Facilities
Neither Third Point Re BDA nor Third Point Re USA is licensed or admitted as an insurer in any jurisdiction other than Bermuda. Many jurisdictions, such as the United States, do not permit clients to take credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial statements if such reinsurance is obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers without appropriate collateral or, in some states, unless they have investment grade financial strength ratings from two recognized rating agencies. Furthermore, certain clients may require that we post collateral in order to meet their counterparty security requirements. As a result, we anticipate that all of our U.S. clients and a portion of our non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral for the contracts we bind with them. We expect this collateral to take the form of funds withheld, trust arrangements or letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018, we have issued letters of credit totaling $349.2 million in favor of clients. The failure to maintain, replace or increase our letter of credit facilities on commercially acceptable terms may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - Our failure to obtain sufficient letter of credit facilities or to increase our letter of credit capacity on commercially acceptable terms as we grow could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy.” 
In addition, we have $644.8 million of restricted cash and investments held in trust accounts to secure obligations under certain reinsurance contracts. 
See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information and details on our collateral arrangements and letter of credit facilities.
Competition 
The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major reinsurers, most of which are well established, have a significant operating history, stronger financial strength ratings, and have developed long-standing client relationships often with a larger breadth of coverage across the property and casualty market in substantially all lines of business. We also compete with smaller companies and other niche reinsurers and a growing number of insurance linked security fund managers. However, we believe that our unique approach to underwriting and extensive relationships allow us to be successful in underwriting transactions against our competitors.
Risk Management 
We have developed a comprehensive risk management strategy that is governed by an articulated vision of risk appetite and control that is conveyed throughout the organization and measured in a transparent and consistent manner. Our risk management strategy, metrics and progress are summarized in a report that is presented to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Our internal capital model incorporates statistics from the pricing, reserving and investment processes to produce an estimate of the amount of capital used at set points in time (e.g., each quarter-end) as well as the overall variability in the prospective financial results. We work closely with the risk management personnel of Third Point LLC, our investment manager, to measure and report the variability of results from our investment portfolio. We also monitor the contractual exposure to catastrophic losses as aggregated across all bound reinsurance contracts. 
Ratings 
Each of our reinsurance subsidiaries has an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating with a stable outlook from A.M. Best, which is the fourth highest of 15 ratings. We believe that a strong rating is a critical factor in the marketing of reinsurance products to clients and brokers. This rating reflects the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations. It is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common shares. 
Change in Investment Account Structure 
On July 31, 2018, Third Point Re, Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA entered into the Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “2018 LPA”) of TP Fund with TP GP and others, effective August 31, 2018. Pursuant to the investment management agreement between Third Point LLC and TP Fund, dated July 31, 2018 as amended and restated on February 28, 2019 (the “TP Fund IMA”), Third Point LLC is the investment manager for TP Fund. In addition, on July 31, 2018, Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, together the “TPRE Limited 

 13
Partners” and TP Fund executed a Subscription Agreement pursuant to which the TPRE Limited Partners transferred certain net investment assets and related liabilities (collectively referred to as the “LP Transaction”) from their separate accounts to TP Fund, and TP Fund issued limited partner interests to the TPRE Limited Partners proportionate to and based on the net asset value transferred by each such entity on the applicable transfer date. Certain collateral assets consisting of debt securities and restricted cash were not transferred to TP Fund but are also managed by Third Point LLC under a separate investment management agreement, as discussed below under “Collateral Assets IMA”. Substantially all of the net investment assets were transferred as of September 4, 2018. The Amended and Restated Joint Venture and Investment Management Agreement dated June 22, 2016 between Third Point Re, Third Point Re BDA, Third Point LLC and TP GP and the Amended and Restated Joint Venture and Investment Management Agreement dated June 22, 2016 between Third Point Re USA, Third Point Re (USA) Holdings Inc., Third Point LLC and TP GP (the “JV Agreements”) will be terminated on the date that all net investment assets have been transferred to TP Fund under the Subscription Agreement. The TP Fund investment strategy, as implemented by Third Point LLC, is intended to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by deploying capital in both long and short investments with favorable risk/reward characteristics across select asset classes, sectors and geographies. Third Point LLC identifies investment opportunities via a bottom-up, value-oriented approach to single security analysis supplemented by a top-down view of portfolio and risk management. Third Point LLC seeks dislocations in certain areas of the capital markets or in the pricing of particular securities and supplements single security analysis with an approach to portfolio construction that includes sizing each investment based on upside/downside calculations, all with a view towards appropriately positioning and managing overall exposures. 
On August 30, 2018, Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA entered into a Participation Agreement (“Participation Agreement”) with TP Fund pursuant to which Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA granted to TP Fund all of the rights, benefits, liabilities, duties and obligations of all net investment assets that had not yet been transferred to TP Fund pursuant to the Subscription Agreement as of the effective date. For the net investment assets that were not transferred on September 4, 2018, the TPRE Limited Partners received limited partnership interests in TP Fund in exchange for transferring the rights, benefits, liabilities, duties and obligations for those net investment assets to TP Fund under the Participation Agreement. 
As discussed below, on February 28, 2019, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement of TP Fund (the “Amended LPA”), which amended and restated the 2018 LPA (as amended and restated by the Amended LPA, the “LPA”), with effect from January 1, 2019. The Amended LPA updated the terms of the 2018 LPA to reflect (i) a lower management fee, (ii) the right to withdraw specified amounts from TP Fund and immediately invest such amounts in certain other investment vehicles formed by Third Point LLC and (iii) adjustments to the loss carryforward terms. All other material terms of the Amended LPA remain consistent with the 2018 LPA.
JV Agreements
As discussed above, the JV Agreements will be terminated on the date that all net investment assets have been transferred to TP Fund under the Subscription Agreement. Substantially all of the net investment assets have been transferred. For information regarding our previous investment guidelines related to the JV agreements, see the summary provided under “Joint Ventures and Investment Management Agreements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018.
Limited Partnership Agreement
Term 
The LPA has a term ending on December 31, 2021, subject to automatic renewal for additional successive three-year terms unless a party notifies the other parties in writing on or before the June 22nd prior to the end of a term that it wishes to terminate such LPA at the end of such term. 
Term and Termination Rights
The LPA shall continue until the first of the following events to occur: (1) at any time, upon the written consent of the TPRE Limited Partners and TP GP, (2) within sixty days of the dissolution, entry of an order for relief or filing of a bankruptcy petition withdrawal of TP GP, unless within such days a successor general parent is elected by a majority 

 14
interest of the limited partners, or (3) subject to the foregoing, any other event causing the mandatory winding up and dissolution of the partnership under the laws of the Cayman Islands. 
We may terminate the LPA upon the death, long-term disability or retirement of Daniel S. Loeb, or the occurrence of other circumstances in which Mr. Loeb is no longer directing the investment program of Third Point LLC or actively involved in the day-to-day management of Third Point LLC.
Withdrawal Rights
Under the LPA, we may withdraw our capital accounts in TP Fund in full on December 31, 2021 (the “Withdrawal Date”), and each successive three-year anniversary of such date.
We may withdraw our capital accounts in TP Fund under the LPA prior to the Withdrawal Date at any time following the occurrence of a “Cause Event”, which is defined as: 

• | a violation of applicable law relating to Third Point LLC’s investment related business;


• | Third Point LLC’s fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of its obligations under the LPA;


• | a material breach by the TP Fund GP of the LPA or Third Point LLC of any material breach of the TP Fund IMA, which, in either case, if such breach is reasonably capable of being cured, is not cured within a 15-day period; a conviction or, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to in the case of Daniel S. Loeb, a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude and, in the case of certain senior officers of Third Point LLC or the TP Fund GP, a felony or crime relating to or adversely affecting the investment-related business of the TP Fund GP or Third Point LLC; 


• | a conviction or, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or a crime affecting the investment related business of Third Point LLC by certain senior officers of Third Point LLC or the TP Fund GP;


• | any act of fraud, material misappropriation, material dishonesty, embezzlement, or similar conduct by or the TP Fund GP or Third Point LLC relating to the TP Fund GP or Third Point LLC’s investment related business; or


• | a formal administrative or other legal proceeding before the SEC, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the FINRA, or any other U.S. or non-U.S. regulatory or self-regulatory organization against Third Point LLC; or certain key personnel which would likely have a material adverse effect on us.

Under the LPA, the TPRE Limited Partners will have the right to withdraw funds weekly from TP Fund to pay claims and expenses as needed, to meet capital adequacy requirements and to satisfy financing obligations. 
In addition, we may withdraw as a participant under the LPA prior to the Withdrawal Date if the net investment performance of Third Point LLC has (a) (i) incurred a loss in two successive calendar years and (ii) underperformed the S&P 500 Index by at least 14 percentage points for such two successive calendar years, taken as a whole, or (b) (i) incurred a cumulative loss of 14% or more during any 24-month period and (ii) underperformed the S&P 500 Index by at least 21 percentage points for such 24-month period. We may not withdraw or terminate the LPA on the basis of performance other than as provided above. 
In addition, pursuant to the Amended LPA, TP GP shall notify us if Third Point LLC or its affiliates (either alone or together with a third party) form certain investment vehicles that pursue an investment strategy primarily comprised of debt or other credit-related investments (the “Permitted Funds”). The Amended LPA permits us to withdraw up to $250.0 million in 2019 and a separate $250.0 million during the period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 for the purpose of immediately investing such amounts in Permitted Funds. 
Performance Allocation 
Pursuant to both the JV Agreements and the LPA, TP GP receives a performance fee allocation. Prior to the change in the Company’s investment account structure, the performance fee allocation was equal to 20% of the net investment income of the applicable company’s share of the net investment assets managed by Third Point LLC. As a result of the LPA effective August 31, 2018, the performance fee allocation is equal to 20% of the net investment income allocated to each limited partner’s capital account in TP Fund. 

 15
At the end of each fiscal year, the performance allocation will be reallocated to the capital account of TP GP from the capital account of each limited partner, provided that a performance allocation will not be made with respect to such capital account until such capital account has recouped the amount of any unrecouped net capital loss in its loss recovery account (as described below). If a limited partner withdraws all or a portion of its capital other than at the end of a fiscal year, the performance allocation accrued and attributable to the portion withdrawn will be debited against such limited partner’s account and credited to TP GP’s capital account at the time of withdrawal. 
Pursuant to both the JV Agreements and the 2018 LPA, Third Point LLC is required to maintain a loss recovery account in respect of each Limited Partner. Thereafter, for any fiscal year, the loss recovery account balance shall be the sum of all prior year net loss amounts allocated to the limited partner and not subsequently offset by prior year net profit amounts allocated to such limited partner, provided that the loss recovery account balance shall be reduced proportionately to reflect any withdrawals made by such Limited Partner. TP GP may waive or reduce the performance allocation, in its sole discretion. Third Point LLC and TP GP may elect, at the beginning of each fiscal year, to restructure the performance allocation as a performance fee to Third Point LLC with the same terms as the performance allocation. 
The Amended LPA preserves the loss carryforward attributable to our investment in TP Fund when contributions to TP Fund are made within nine months of certain types of withdrawals from TP Fund.
Management Fee 
Pursuant to both the JV Agreements and the LPA, Third Point LLC is entitled to receive monthly management fees. Prior to the change in the Company’s investment account structure, management fees were calculated based on 1.5%, (2.0% up to December 22, 2016), of net investments managed by Third Point LLC. As a result of the 2018 LPA effective August 31, 2018, management fees were charged at the TP Fund level and were calculated based on 1.5% of the investment in TP Fund and multiplied by an exposure multiplier computed by dividing the average daily investment exposure leverage of the TP Fund by the average daily investment exposure leverage of the Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P. (“Offshore Master Fund”). The Amended LPA revised the management fee from 1.5% per annum to 1.25% per annum effective from January 1, 2019. Third Point LLC also serves as the investment manager for the Offshore Master Fund. 
Most Favored Nation
In the event that Third Point LLC agrees terms with any existing or future investor wherein the asset-based fees or performance-based compensation that are equal to or more favorable to such investor, Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, will have the right to receive the benefit of such terms (provided it agrees to be bound by all the terms and conditions associated with such equal or more favorable terms). 
Investment Guidelines 
In accordance with the investment guidelines under the LPA, the underlying investment portfolio of TP Fund is managed on a basis that is substantially equivalent to Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P., which is managed by Third Point LLC, but with increased exposures through the use of additional financial leverage. The leverage of TP Fund will be managed based on the terms of the LPA to generally target a “leverage factor” of (a) one and one half times (1.5x) for investments in liquid securities and (b) one time (1x) for investments in illiquid securities and ABS securities, in each case, as determined by TP GP in its sole discretion.
Under the LPA, TP GP is required to cause Third Point LLC to adhere to the following investment guidelines: 

• | Composition of Investments: at least 60% of the investment portfolio will be held in debt or equity securities (including swaps) of publicly traded companies (or their subsidiaries) and governments of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) high income countries, asset-backed securities, cash, cash equivalents and gold and other precious metals.


• | Concentration of Investments: other than cash, cash equivalents and U.S. government obligations, TP Fund’s total exposure to any one issuer or entity will constitute no more than 15% (multiplied by the exposure multiplier, the exposure multiplier will be computed by dividing the average of the daily investment exposure

 16
leverage of TP Fund by the average of the daily investment exposure leverage of Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P.) of the investment portfolio’s total long exposure. 

• | Liquidity: the portfolio of TP Fund will be invested in such fashion that the Company have a reasonable expectation that they can meet any of its liabilities as they become due. We review the liquidity of the portfolio on a periodic basis.


• | Net Exposure Limits: the net position (long positions less short positions) may not exceed 2 times net asset value for more than 10 trading days in any 30-trading day period.

Upon written request of Third Point LLC, our senior management may, in exigent circumstances, permit a variation from these guidelines.
See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for detailed information on management and performance fees.
Collateral Assets IMA
On July 31, 2018, Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA entered into the Collateral Assets IMA, effective August 31, 2018, pursuant to which Third Point LLC serves as investment manager of certain collateral assets that will not be transferred to TP Fund. The Collateral Assets IMA will continue in effect for so long as either Third Point Re BDA or Third Point Re USA remains a limited partner of TP Fund. The collateral assets are presented in the consolidated balance sheets within debt securities and restricted cash and are considered as part of total net investments managed by Third Point LLC. 
The Collateral Assets IMA includes provisions limiting liability of Third Point LLC and its affiliates to specified circumstances and providing for indemnification by Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA for certain losses incurred by Third Point LLC and its affiliates. Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA will be responsible for any and all third party expenses incurred by them or on their behalf that are directly attributable to the management of the collateral assets, other than those borne by Third Point LLC. No asset based or performance-based compensation will be paid to Third Point LLC by Third Point Re BDA or Third Point Re USA under the Collateral Assets IMA.
Upon three business days’ prior written notice, Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA may withdraw all or a portion of the collateral assets effective as of any calendar month end or on the close of business on each Wednesday during a month.
Investments 
Investment Strategy 
Third Point LLC has the contractual right to manage substantially all of our investable assets until December 31, 2021, subject to certain extension and termination rights described above, and is required to follow our investment guidelines described above and to act in a manner that is fair and equitable in allocating investment opportunities to us. However, it is not otherwise restricted with respect to the nature or timing of making investments for our accounts. We have the contractual right to withdraw funds from our managed accounts to pay claims and expenses as needed.

In managing TP Fund’s investment portfolio, Third Point LLC assigns every investment position a sector, strategy and geographic category. The dollar exposure of each position under each category is aggregated and the exposure percentages listed in the exposure table represent the aggregate market exposure of a given category against the total net asset value of the consolidated account. Long and short exposure percentages represent the aggregate relative value of all long and short positions in a given category, respectively. Net exposure represents the short exposure subtracted from the long exposure in a given category. Third Point LLC reports the composition of TP Fund’s total managed portfolio on a market exposure basis, which it believes is the appropriate manner in which to assess the exposure and profile of investments and is the way in which it manages the portfolio. Under this methodology, the exposure for equity swaps and futures contracts are reported at their full notional amount. The notional amount of any derivative contract 

 18
is the underlying value upon which payment obligations are computed. For an equity total return swap, for example, the notional amount is the number of shares underlying the swap multiplied by the market price of those shares. Options are reported at their delta adjusted basis. The delta of an option is the sensitivity of the option price to the underlying stock price. The delta adjusted basis is the number of shares underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock price. Credit derivatives are reported in accordance with their equivalent underlying security exposure. Cash and cash equivalents are excluded from exposure calculations. 
Investment Returns 
The following is a summary of the net investment return by investment strategy on investments managed by Third Point LLC for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016(1) . The net investment return includes our investment accounts, inclusive of collateral assets managed by Third Point LLC, prior to August 31, 2018, the date of the change in the investment account structure described in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, and our investment in TP Fund and collateral assets managed by Third Point LLC from the date of the transition.

(1) | Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for detailed information on net investment income (loss). TP Fund’s investment manager, Third Point LLC, manages several funds and may manage other client accounts besides our and TP Fund’s accounts, some of which have, or may have, objectives and investment portfolio compositions similar to our and TP Fund’s accounts. Because of the similarity or potential similarity of the investment portfolio of TP Fund to other clients of Third Point LLC, and because, as a matter of ordinary course, Third Point LLC provides its clients, including us and TP Fund, and investors in its main hedge funds with results of their respective investment portfolios following the last day of each month, those other clients or investors indirectly may have material nonpublic information regarding the investment portfolio of TP Fund. To address this, and to comply with Regulation FD, we will continue to post on our website under the heading Investment Portfolio Returns located in the Investors section of the website, following the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day of each month, the preliminary monthly investment results of TP Fund for that month, with additional information regarding the monthly investment results of TP Fund to be posted following the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the first business day of the following month.
Investment Regulatory Concerns and Restrictions 
Third Point LLC is involved regularly in trading activities that involve a broad number of U.S. and foreign securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that involve fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of such laws could result in severe restrictions on Third Point LLC’s activities and, indirectly, damage to TP Fund’s investment portfolio and our and TP Fund’s reputation as the LPA has limited termination provisions. 
Third Point LLC’s failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions. The regulations that Third Point LLC is subject to are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect us or, indirectly, you. Even if a sanction imposed against Third Point LLC or one of its personnel by a regulator was for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to such sanction against Third Point LLC by regulators could harm its reputation and, possibly, ours. 

 19
In recent years, there has been debate in both the U.S. and foreign governments about new rules or regulations to be applicable to alternative investment advisers, like Third Point LLC. 
In August 2007, the SEC adopted a new rule intended to clarify the SEC’s authority to bring enforcement actions against investment advisers for fraud against investors and prospective investors in their funds (as opposed to fraud against the funds themselves). Although we do not believe the SEC’s rule has directly affected us, Third Point LLC and, accordingly, TP Fund’s investment strategy, may be adversely affected if new or revised legislation or regulations are enacted or by changes to existing rules and regulations of U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. 
It is possible that increased regulation of alternative investment advisers could adversely affect Third Point LLC’s ability to manage TP Fund’s investment portfolio or its ability to manage TP Fund’s portfolio pursuant to our existing investment strategy, which could cause us to alter our existing investment strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, adverse publicity regarding alternative investment strategies generally, or Third Point LLC or its affiliates specifically, could negatively affect our business reputation and attractiveness as a counterparty to brokers and clients. 
Other Trading Restrictions 
Third Point LLC may from time to time place it or its affiliates’ representatives on creditors committees or boards of certain companies in which our portfolio is invested. While such representation may enable Third Point LLC to enhance the value of our and TP Fund’s investments, it may place trading restrictions on certain securities included in TP Fund’s investment portfolio. 
Regulation
Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA are licensed in Bermuda to write reinsurance and are not admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the United States or in any country other than Bermuda. The insurance laws of each state of the United States and of many foreign countries regulate the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by alien insurers and reinsurers, such as Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA. 
Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA currently intend to conduct their business so as not to be subject to the licensing requirements of insurance regulators in the United States or elsewhere (other than Bermuda). Many aspects of the activities of Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA are similar to those employed by other non-admitted reinsurers that provide reinsurance to U.S. and other ceding companies. There can be no assurance, however, that insurance regulators in the United States or elsewhere will not review the activities of Third Point Re BDA or Third Point Re USA and claim that Third Point Re BDA or Third Point Re USA is subject to such jurisdiction’s licensing requirements. 
The Insurance Act of 1978
The Insurance Act of 1978, as amended, and related regulations of Bermuda (the “Insurance Act”), which regulates the insurance business of Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, provides that no person shall carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”). Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA are each registered as Class 4 insurers under the Insurance Act. Class 4 insurers are required to maintain fully paid-up share capital of $1,000,000. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below. 
Annual Financial Statements
As Class 4 insurers, Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA must prepare and submit, on an annual basis, both audited U.S. GAAP and statutory financial statements as prescribed by the Insurance Act. 

 20
Declaration of Compliance
Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, at the time of filing their statutory financial statements, will also be required to deliver to the BMA a declaration of compliance, in such form and with such content as may be prescribed by the BMA.
Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return
Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers, are required to file with the BMA a statutory financial return. The statutory financial return includes, among other matters, the statutory financial statements and the calculations for the Class 4 insurer’s minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio. 
In addition, each year Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers, are also required to file with the BMA a capital and solvency return along with their annual financial statutory returns. The prescribed form of capital and solvency return comprises the insurer’s Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”) model or an approved internal capital model in lieu thereof (more fully described below), various schedules, a statutory economic balance sheet and the opinion of the loss reserve specialist.
Quarterly Financial Statements
Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers are each required to prepare and file quarterly financial returns with the BMA on or before the last day of the months of May, August and November of each year. 
Public Disclosures
Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4, insurers are each required to prepare and file with the BMA, and also publish on their website, a financial condition report. The BMA has discretion to approve modifications and exemptions to the public disclosure rules, on application by the insurer if, among other things, the BMA is satisfied that the disclosure of certain information will result in a competitive disadvantage or compromise confidentiality obligations of the insurer.
Non-insurance Business
Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers may not engage in non-insurance business unless that non-insurance business is ancillary to their core insurance business. 
Minimum Liquidity Ratio
The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business. As an insurer engaged in general business, Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA are each required to maintain the value of their relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of their relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include cash and time deposits, quoted investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable, reinsurance balances receivable, funds held by ceding reinsurers and any other assets which the BMA, on application in any particular case made to it with reasons, accepts in that case.There are certain categories of assets that, unless specifically permitted by the BMA, do not automatically qualify as relevant assets, such as unquoted equity securities, investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans.The relevant liabilities are total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income taxes and letters of credit, guarantees and other instruments.
Minimum Solvency Margin and Enhanced Capital Requirements
The Insurance Act provides that the value of the statutory assets of an insurer must exceed the value of its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than its prescribed minimum solvency margin (the “MSM”).The MSM that must be maintained by a Class 4 insurer with respect to its general business is the greater of (i) $100 million, or (ii) 50% of net premium written (with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding 25% of gross premiums) or (iii) 15% of net loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves; or (iv) 25% of the ECR (as defined below) as reported at the end of the relevant year.

 21
Class 4 insurers are also required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of its enhanced capital requirement (“ECR”), which is established by reference to either the BSCR model or an approved internal capital model. The BMA has also implemented the economic balance sheet (“EBS”) framework, which is used as the basis to determine an insurer’s ECR. Under the new framework, assets and liabilities are mainly assessed and included on the EBS at fair value, with the insurer’s U.S. GAAP balance sheet serving as a starting point. The model also requires insurers to estimate insurance technical provisions, which consist of the insurer’s insurance related balances valued based on best-estimate cash flows, adjusted to reflect the time value of money using a risk-free discount rate, with the addition of a risk margin to reflect the uncertainty in the underlying cash flows.
The BSCR model is a risk-based capital model which provides a method for determining a Class 4 insurer’s capital requirements (statutory economic capital and surplus) by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the Class 4 insurer’s business. 
While not specifically referred to in the Insurance Act, the BMA has also established a target capital level (“TCL”) for each Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of its ECR. While a Class 4 insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory capital and surplus at this level, the TCL serves as an early warning tool for the BMA and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased regulatory oversight.
Eligible Capital
To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of the insurer’s capital resources, a Class 4 insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its capital in accordance with the recently introduced ‘3-tiered capital system’. Under this system, all of the insurer’s capital instruments will be classified as either basic or ancillary capital, which in turn will be classified into one of 3 tiers based on their “loss absorbency” characteristics. Under this regime, up to certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may be used to support the insurer’s MSM, ECR and TCL.
Insurance Code of Conduct
Every Bermuda registered insurer must comply with the Insurance Code of Conduct, which prescribes duties, standards, procedures and sound business principles to ensure sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls are implemented by the relevant insurer. The BMA will assess an insurer's compliance with the Insurance Code of Conduct in a proportionate manner relative to the nature, scale and complexity of its business. Failure to comply with the requirements under the Insurance Code of Conduct will be a factor taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner as prescribed by the Insurance Act. Such failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Code of Conduct could result in the BMA exercising its powers of intervention and investigation and will be a factor in calculating the operational risk charge applicable in accordance with the insurer's BSCR model or approved internal model.
Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions
A Class 4 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it is in breach of its MSM, ECR or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where an insurer fails to meet its MSM or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA.
In addition, a Class 4 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year’s statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit signed by at least two directors (one of whom must be a Bermuda resident director if any of the insurer’s directors are resident in Bermuda) and the principal representative stating that it will continue to meet its solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. Where such an affidavit is filed, it shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the BMA.
Reduction of Capital
Neither Third Point Re BDA nor Third Point Re USA, as general business insurers, may reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in their respective previous year’s financial statements, unless it has received the prior approval of the BMA. Total statutory capital consists of the insurer’s paid in share capital, its contributed surplus 

 22
(sometimes called additional paid in capital) and any other fixed capital designated by the BMA as statutory capital (such as letters of credit).
Fit and Proper Controllers
The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers of all registered insurers in Bermuda. A controller includes (i) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company; (ii) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company; (iii) a shareholder controller; and, (iv) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act.
The definition of shareholder controller is set out in the Insurance Act but generally refers to (i) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders’ meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company, or (ii) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any shareholders’ meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company, or (iii) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any shareholders’ meeting.
A shareholder controller that owns 10% or more but less than 20% of the shares as described above is defined as a 10% shareholder controller; a shareholder controller that owns 20% or more but less than 33% of the shares as described above is defined as a 20% shareholder controller; a shareholder controller that owns 33% or more but less than 50% of the shares as described above is defined as a 33% shareholder controller; and a shareholder controller that owns 50% or more of the shares as described above is defined as a 50% shareholder controller.
Where the shares of the registered insurer, or the shares of its parent company, are traded on a recognised stock exchange, and such person becomes a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller of the insurer, that person shall, within 45 days, notify the BMA in writing that he has become such a controller. In addition, a person who is a shareholder controller of a Class 4 insurer whose shares or the shares of its parent company (if any) are traded on a recognised stock exchange must serve on the BMA a notice in writing that he has reduced or disposed of his holding in the insurer where the proportion of voting rights in the insurer held by him will have reached or has fallen below 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% as the case may be, not later than 45 days after such disposal. 
Where the shares of an insurer, or the shares of its parent company, are not traded on a recognised stock exchange (i.e., private companies), the Insurance Act prohibits such person from becoming a shareholder controller unless he has first served on the BMA notice in writing stating that he intends to become such a controller and the BMA has either, before the end of 45 days following the date of notification, provided notice to the proposed controller that it does not object to his becoming such a controller or the full 45 days has elapsed without the BMA filing an objection. In addition, a shareholder controller of Third Point Re BDA or Third Point Re USA is not permitted to reduce or dispose of its holdings such that it will cease to be a 50%, 33%, 20% or 10% shareholder unless that shareholder controller notifies the BMA in writing that it intends to do so. 
Notification by Registered Person of Change of Controllers and Officers
All registered insurers are required to give written notice to the BMA of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the registered insurer within 45 days of becoming aware of such fact. 
Notification of Material Changes
All registered insurers are required to give notice to the BMA of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Insurance Act. No registered insurer shall take any steps to give effect to a material change unless it has first served notice on the BMA that it intends to effect such material change and before the end of 30 days, either the BMA has notified such company in writing that it has no objection to such change or that period has lapsed without the BMA having issued a notice of objection.
Supervision, Investigation, Intervention and Disclosure
The BMA may, by notice in writing served on an insurer, require the insurer to provide such information and/or documentation as the BMA may reasonably require with respect to matters that are likely to be material to the 

 23
performance of its supervisory functions under the Insurance Act. In addition, it may require such person’s auditor, underwriter, accountant or any other person with relevant professional skill of such insurer to prepare a report on any aspect pertaining thereto. If it appears to the BMA to be desirable in the interests of the clients of an insurer, the BMA may also exercise these powers in relation to subsidiaries, parent companies and other affiliates of the insurer or designated insurer.
Disclosure of Information
In addition to powers under the Insurance Act to investigate the affairs of an insurer, the BMA may require certain information from an insurer (or certain other persons) to be produced to the BMA. Further, the BMA has been given powers to assist other regulatory authorities, including foreign insurance regulatory authorities, with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda if it is satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities and that such cooperation is in the public interest. 
Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations
All Bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making distributions from contributed surplus. A company may not declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (i) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (ii) the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities.
United States Insurance Regulation
In addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed, reinsurers are subject to indirect regulatory requirements imposed by jurisdictions in which their ceding companies are licensed through the “credit for reinsurance” mechanism. In general, a ceding company that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed, accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the insurer files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums and loss reserves and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer.
In the United States, many states allow credit for reinsurance ceded to a reinsurer that is domiciled and licensed in another state of the United States and meets certain financial requirements. A few states do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non-licensed reinsurers except in certain limited circumstances and others impose additional requirements that make it difficult to become accredited. The great majority of states, however, permit the reduction in statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non-licensed or non-accredited reinsurer to be offset to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit or other acceptable security arrangement, and a few states reduce the amount of security to be posted based on a number of factors, including the credit rating given to a reinsurer from a U.S. nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
Information Technology 
We have a disaster recovery plan with respect to our information technology infrastructure that includes arrangements with an offshore data center. Our off-island location for data systems back-up and recovery is located in Halifax, Canada, providing a remote site that we believe is unlikely to be subject to the same disaster events that might impair our operations in Bermuda. The disaster recovery environment is configured to provide near real-time backup for key systems to minimize the amount of time needed to restore data following a disaster scenario and support the necessary business capabilities of our Bermuda and U.S. operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 31 employees, 20 of whom were based in Bermuda, 10 of whom were based in the United States and 1 of whom was based in the United Kingdom. We believe that our employee relations are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.
