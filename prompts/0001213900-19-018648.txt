Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
 
We are a leader in cannabis compliance, inventory tracking technology, and provider of the cannabis industry’s first enterprise resource planning technology. Our products enable cannabis businesses and government agencies across multiple industries and geographies to compliantly manage the cannabis supply chain from seed-to-sale and collect and synthesize valuable data to enable visibility and operations management at scale. Our proprietary software platform is adaptable for industries in which interfacing with government regulatory agencies for compliance purposes is required, or where the tracking of organic materials from seed or plant to end products is desired. Nine years ago, we identified a need for organic material tracking and regulatory compliance software as a service (“SaaS”) solutions in the growing cannabis industry, including state-legal THC-containing cannabis (“marijuana”) and Cannabidiol (“CBD”)-only containing cannabis (“hemp”) industry. Our software tracks cannabis from seed to sale to provide transparency, visibility, and accountability across the entire plant lifecycle. Today, seed-to-sale tracking has become a compliance requirement across most states and countries where cannabis has been legalized. The Company’s products assist governments in monitoring compliance with state laws and regulations and enables state-licensed businesses to monitor compliance with such laws and regulations. We provide our regulatory software platform, Leaf Data Systems®, to state government regulatory agencies, and our business software platform, MJ Platform®, to state-licensed businesses. Although we have helped monitor legal compliance in cannabis sales, we do not handle any cannabis related material, process sales transactions within the United States, or generate revenue based on the type or amount of sales made by our clients, as revenues are generated by us on a fixed-fee based subscription model. Our annual revenues have grown each year since inception, from approximately $0.8 million in our full year of operations in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 to approximately $10.9 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.
 
We believe that the cannabis industry (marijuana and hemp) will continue to grow both through additional legalization at state and federal levels, new consumer/patient growth in existing markets, as well as innovation and discovery of new applications for cannabis and hemp in consumer products, medical applications, and industrial goods. In response to this growth, we believe cannabis companies will continue to consolidate and scale to be multi-state, multi-country enterprise operations.

We believe that many of today’s enterprise supply chain and inventory-management products built for industries outside of cannabis are not designed to handle the complexity and uniqueness of cannabis material and regulations nor are they designed to track goods or products from seed to sale. Cannabis is particularly difficult to track due to the dried flower nature of the product, which includes weight-based tracking versus unit of measurements, moisture-loss of product over time, equivalencies of dried flower to manufactured products for patient and consumer purchase limits, the high value of the product, and tracking of all plant material including waste. Compliance requirements for cannabis do not mirror the compliance requirements of other regulated industries, and cannabis compliance requirements vary from state to state and country to country. Legacy ERP (“Enterprise Resource Planning”) systems were not built to handle the complexities of cannabis products while diverse compliance schemes do not have seed-to-sale tracking as a core system design and have not proved to be nimble enough to keep up with constantly changing regulations. 
 
Our mission to create the world’s most transparent and accountable consumer packaged cannabis goods supply chain. To keep pace with increasing cannabis businesses, we believe our products are built to scale nationally and internationally while providing technology compliance, monitoring and auditing across the entire cannabis supply chain and all industry verticals (cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, retail and delivery). We serve businesses and governments globally. Since establishment in 2010, we have tracked nearly $16 billion   in legal cannabis sales with clients across 13 international countries, including the Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Uruguay, Italy, Jamaica, and Macedonia, and 29 states, federal districts, and commonwealths of the U.S., including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We believe these factors establish us as a developed, vetted solution in the industry. We expect to leverage our first-mover advantage and reputation among industry participants throughout the global supply chain to increase market share, such as the rapidly expanding Asian hemp market.

Our core products, Leaf Data Systems and MJ Platform, are highly-versatile platforms that provide clients with a central data management system for tracking regulated products to sale – from seed to initial plant growth to product – throughout the complete supply chain, using a global unique identifier method. Our platforms also provide clients with integrated security, transparency and scalability capabilities. These capabilities allow our state-licensed clients to control inventory, operate efficiently in a fast-changing industry and comply with state, local, and federal (in countries such as Canada and Colombia) regulation at all times, and allows our government regulatory clients to effectively and cost-efficiently monitor licensees and ensure that commercial businesses are complying with their states’ regulations.
 
We generate revenue in three principal areas:
 

● | Government Regulatory Software – Leaf Data Systems is our SaaS product for government agencies. Leaf Data Systems is a compliance tracking system designed to give regulators visibility into the activity of licensed cannabis businesses in their jurisdictions. We have been serving two clients for Leaf Data Systems, the State of Washington and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As described below, we recently signed a third Leaf Data Systems client, the state of Utah. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Commercial Software – MJ Platform is our SaaS offering for state-licensed businesses. MJ Platform is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) compliance system specific to the cannabis industry, including state-legal marijuana and hemp CBD industry. MJ Platform is comprised of integrated modules designed to meet the regulations and inventory management needs of cannabis and hemp CBD cultivators, manufacturers, distributors and retailers. 


● | Consulting Services – We provide consulting services to cannabis industry operators interested in entering the cannabis industry and in integrating our platforms into their respective operations and systems. We consult with clients on a wide range of areas to help them successfully operate in the cannabis industry in compliance with state law. We work with clients to efficiently comply with state requirements in connection with the launch and operations of their cannabis businesses. Our management team and key personnel have broad experience gained form working with numerous cannabis operations. Our consulting team has experience in most aspects of cannabis operations in most verticals (e.g., cultivation, processing, distribution, manufacturing and retail). Our service providers understand the intricacies of the varying regulations governing cannabis in each jurisdiction and, to the extent necessary, modify the professional services based on the jurisdiction. We provide project-focused consulting services to clients that are initiating or expanding their cannabis businesses or are interested in data consulting engagements with respect to the legal cannabis industry. Our advisory engagements include service offerings focused on compliance requirement assessments, readiness and best practices, compliance monitoring systems, application processes, inspection readiness and business plan and compliance reviews. We typically provide our consulting services to clients in emerging markets that are seeking consultation on newly introduced licensing regimes and assistance with the regulatory compliant build-out of operations in newly legal states. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We also resell a limited number of printers for printing compliance product labels and scales that are National Type Evaluation Program (“NTEP”) certified legal for trade. Revenue from these resale activities was approximately 2% and 1% of total revenue in the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively, and is not expected to become a significant generator of revenue.
 
Cannabis Industry
 
General
 
We believe the growing cannabis industry in numerous U.S. states and other countries outside of the U.S. represents an ideal market for our technology, as both states and countries need to ensure legal compliance and the maintenance of the seed-to-sale life cycle within their jurisdictions. Furthermore, legally licensed operating companies need to ensure they operate within applicable state law and carefully track inventory.
 
Although in its early stages, the cannabis and hemp industries (medicinal and adult-use) are experiencing rapid growth. Total legal cannabis spending in the U.S., (excluding pharmaceutical and retail CBD) grew to $9.8 billion in 2018 from $8.5 billion in 2017. According to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics’ latest “State of Legal Cannabis Markets” report, the legal cannabinoid market in regulated dispensaries, pharmacies and retail outlets is projected to grow to $44.8 billion by 2024, as the number of states, territories, and nations liberalizing their cannabis legalization rules and policies grows. The forecast is based on expectations that by 2024, every U.S. state, Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories will have active medical cannabis programs, and 20 states, Washington, D.C., and two territories will have active adult-use markets. The report notes the expected expansion in legalization actions should drive U.S. legal cannabis spending to nearly $30 billion in 2024, growing at a compounded annual growth rate in excess of 20%.
 
Further to our current addressable market, the regulatory changes in the 2018 Farm Bill in the U.S. have created an opportunity for hemp-based CBD in general retail and pharmaceutical channels. Additionally, multiple countries across the world have legalized hemp for growth and export including China, Italy, Australia and South Korea. In the U.S., hemp-derived CBD is available broadly across retailers (not solely licensed cannabis dispensaries), including online, drug and convenience stores, natural product, beauty, grocery and pet stores. According to Grand View Research, Industrial Hemp Market Analysis, in 2019 the U.S. hemp market will grow to $1.37 billion and the global hemp market will reach $4.6 billion.
 
The cannabis industry is a fast-growing, increasingly complex, and rapidly changing landscape. Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics note that the range of regulatory schemes is wide, and fines for non-compliance are steep. Proper, safe and profitable operation of a cannabis business requires a full understanding of applicable laws, the ability to track plants and products to ensure compliance with these laws, and the ability to operate at scale in a competitive environment.
 
We use our years of experience, proprietary databases, and resources to identify trends and predict changes in the cannabis industry in order to evolve our products and better assist our clients in operating in compliance with the applicable laws of their jurisdictions and capitalizing on commercial opportunities within the applicable regulatory framework, with accuracy, efficiency, and geographic specificity. We have two data products: The MJ Platform Business Intelligence (“BI”); and Akerna Acumen Big Data, which both leverage the extensive data captured in each of MJ Platform’s cultivation, E&I, distribution and retail modules. BI gives MJ Platform clients access to aggregate data across their organization to keep track of emerging legal and commercial trends, allowing for informed actionable insights at various levels within the organization, including room, location, state, brand and administration. MJ Platform allows users to align their operational data from three vantage points: in real-time; past trends; and predictive future. This proprietary database assists user in making important decisions in real-time with respect to product monitoring, tracking, planning and pricing.

Seed to Sale
 
Accurate tracking of any organic products requires the ability to identify an item that changes over time. A seed grows into a plant, and a plant is refined into multiple different products, some of which are sold to consumers, and others of which are destroyed or allowed to expire. The following is a general description of the seed-to-sale process:
 
Cultivation. The process of growing begins at the cultivation facility, where all living plants are tracked throughout their growth phases. The plants progress from propagation material (seeds or tissue cultures), to the vegetative stage (immature plants), then to the flowering stage (mature plants).
 
Harvest. Upon harvest, weights are gathered which represent the weight of the flower and other material (e.g., stems and roots). Weights decrease as product is processed through drying, trimming and elimination of waste.
 
Quality Assurance (“QA”) Laboratory Testing. Certain jurisdictions require cannabis or hemp CBD material to be tested. Samples of flower and other material are sent to a testing laboratory where the required testing can be performed. While product samples are undergoing lab testing, the remaining packages of the associated inventory remain quarantined until passing test results have been entered by the testing laboratory.
 
Packaging. Once harvested material has had the appropriate QA testing performed, harvest packages may be transferred to extraction and infusion (“E&I”) facilities to undergo extraction and infusion processes. E&I facilities process the usable plant material for sale, or extract the organic compounds from the plant, which can then be packaged for sale directly as concentrated extract, such as cannabis concentrate, or processed into infused products (such as topical products, edible products, and tinctures). In some jurisdictions, it is required that samples be sent to a testing laboratory again at this point for final testing prior to being transported to retail facilities to be distributed to consumers.
 
Our Platform Capabilities
 
Our platforms and related technology offer wide ranging capabilities. We integrate these capabilities into our software offerings to provide platforms that allow government regulators to engage in accurate and real-time compliance monitoring, and which provide licensed businesses with a true enterprise solution for managing their inventory and compliance. Key capabilities of the Leaf Data Systems and MJ Platform include:

● | Seed-to-Sale Tracking – This allows tracking of products from cultivation, through harvest and processing and manufacturing, to monitoring of the final sale to the patient or customer. Our traceability technology captures everything that happens in an individual plant’s life, providing visibility into the supply chain from any measurement of finished product dispensed to a patient or customer, back to the plant it came from, and all activity, transportation, and transactions that happen in between. While we do not provide point of sale processing, and never takes, owns, or handles any product or cash transaction, our platform does record all sales as part of state and jurisdictional compliance monitoring processes. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Single System Integration – This allows state-licensed clients to manage inventory, customer records and staff in one tracking system. MJ Platform and Leaf Data Systems platforms can be fully integrated with one another. Our platforms can also be integrated with systems of numerous third-party suppliers. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Remote Usage and Connectivity – This allows access through any Internet connection from anywhere and on any device. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leaf Data Systems
 
General
 
Leaf Data Systems provides regulatory authorities with visibility into the operations of licensed medical and recreational cannabis businesses. Licensed cannabis facilities within a state can track plant and product movement and waste across their organization, which is processed into reporting tailored to the government agencies that regulate and enforce the rules of the industry. This gives regulators a tool for transparency and accountability across the cannabis supply chain to ensure public and product safety as well as to monitor sales and inventory within the industry. Leaf Data Systems is customized to the regulations of the state in which it is contracted and tailored to capture the relevant data points desired by regulatory officials.

Government regulators desire visibility at critical junctures within the seed-to-sale chain of custody in order to ensure public safety, monitor sales data for the purposes of taxation, and perform physical inspections of cannabis industry facilities. Leaf Data Systems allows for specific data points captured during these workflows to be compiled into the state and regional view retrievable by regulatory officials. These data points include:
 

● | Licensed facilities locations; 
--+-----------------------------------


● | Individual employees at licensed facilities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Specific physical locations at licensed facilities, such as where plants are grown, or products exist; 


● | Plants tracked as they move through their life cycle with location, phase, and origin data captured; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Harvest details collected throughout the harvest process; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Product and type attributes associated with physical inventory; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Packages of physical inventory on hand at a licensed facility and all associated actions performed with inventory, such as inventory adjustments, transfers and destruction; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Wholesale and retail transactions. 
--+---------------------------------------

 
Leaf Data Systems leverages the use of unique identifiers that are assigned to each batch, plant and inventory item to connect the life cycle phases together and provide the foundation for the chain of custody. State officials are able to review all seed-to-sale information captured for all licensees through reporting of real-time data. The system allows regulators the ability to set alerts based on specific data points and their relative expected values to identify anomalies that might indicate diversion.
 
Leaf Data Systems provides regulators with three methods for data capture from licensees:
 

● | Application Programming Interface (“API”) – Licensees that utilize business management software provided by a third-party vendor to manage their plants, inventory and sales (including the MJ Platform) can integrate their existing system with Leaf Data Systems via an API. An API is a set of requirements that governs how one software application communicates with another. Our API details for Leaf Data Systems are available for any software company to utilize for their clients’ benefit. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | File Upload – If API integration is not a possibility, licensees can utilize the data upload feature using comma-separated values (“CSV”) files. A CSV file is a common format for data exchange that is widely supported and is useful for transferring tabular data between programs that operate on incompatible formats. Leaf Data Systems provides a template as a guideline for proper formatting of CSV files for any data to be uploaded. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | User Interface – Licensees who choose not to utilize API integration capabilities or data upload tools have the option of manually entering each line item of data to be captured. Leaf Data Systems’ data collection forms allow field by field detail entry for each piece of information that must be recorded. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Leaf Data Systems allows government regulatory clients to track product of licensees from seed to plant, view manifest data on demand in order to verify the transport details for a licensee transporting cannabis products or materials, and ensure proper taxation and payment of fees by licensees.

Government Contract Bidding Process
 
When seeking cannabis compliance monitoring and regulatory governance systems, states publish requests for proposal (“RFP”) to which companies, such as us, can respond. We monitor government contract opportunities by reviewing all available state registries for notifications of RFP and similar proposal invitations. We have relationships with industry lobbyists, industry coalitions, regulatory agencies and industry businesses, enabling us to learn of all government contract opportunities. We believe our industry expertise, adaptable platform technology and ability to timely provide a quality commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution at a competitive price provides us with the ability to win the bidding process and secure state regulatory customers.
 
Based on an RFP, we conduct internal road-mapping to determine if there is value in responding to the proposal. If we decide to proceed, we will formulate a detailed response, including granular responses to solicitation requirements; identifying and detailing the benefits of the Leaf Data System for the state’s needs and formulating a pricing regime that the state will find attractive. Typically, we will propose three pricing models, all of which consider the extent of customization required and the number of expected licensees operating across the platform:
 

● | The state pays for the entire project – In this model, the state pays all costs associated with implementation, licensee tags (e.g., radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, barcode tags, etc.), ongoing support, and maintenance for the duration of the contract.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The costs for the project are split between the state and the licensees – In this model, the state pays for implementation and ongoing support and maintenance, while the licensees might pay for cost of tags. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The licensees pay for the entire project – In this model, the licensees bear the entire cost of the project in the form of monthly fees or license tag fees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently 24 out of a total of 33 states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, are using some form of cannabis compliance tracking, which is becoming a standard for states that legalize medicinal or recreational cannabis. We believe that states’ demand for these platforms will continue to increase as further state-level cannabis legislation is introduced, and the existing legalized states further expand their compliance initiatives.
 
We have been awarded contracts in Washington, Pennsylvania, and Utah.


We have exclusivity in the Pennsylvania market due to our government contract, which requires operators in the state to use not only our track and trace system Leaf Data Systems but also our seed to sale tracking ERP product MJ Platform.
 
Agreement with State of Washington
 
We have supplied Washington State with Leaf Data Systems since 2017. The platform has been integrated with the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board and is used to monitor, control, and report on activities of authorized producers, processors and dispensaries. This project involved the conversion of three years of cannabis tracking data from the state’s prior tracking system, coordinating the cutover of all licensed businesses in the state to the Leaf Data Systems, and the integration of APIs from numerous third parties.
 
In July 2017, we and the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (“WSLCB”) entered into a services contract for our provision of the Leaf Data System. The contract provides for us to undertake the work necessary to implement and integrate the Leaf Data system with WSLCB, with a subscription for maintenance and other services by us thereafter. The initial term of the contract for performance of such implementation and integration commenced on July 10, 2017. Upon final acceptance and approval by WSLCB of the implementation of the Leaf Data System, the term of the state’s subscription for software maintenance and support shall initially be for one year, with up to five consecutive one-year renewals, at the sole option of Washington State. As of the date hereof, we are completing the implementation of the Leaf Data system with WSLCB, including providing deliverables such as project management plans, testing, data conversion, interfaces, training, production cutover, and initial licensing. The subscription fee payable by WSLCB includes all costs associated with hosting, licensing, and support for each year of subscription services. WSLCB shall pay in advance the respective annual cost. Suspension or termination of this contract by WSLCB can occur in whole or any part at any time for certain prescribed reasons, including our breach of the contract, for the convenience of Washington State or the failure of Washington State to allocate funds in its budget for the Contract.

Agreement with State of Pennsylvania
 
We have supplied Pennsylvania with Leaf Data Systems since 2017. The platform has been integrated with the Pennsylvania Department of Health and is used to monitor, control, and report on activities of authorized growers/processors, dispensaries, laboratories, clinical registrants, and academic clinical research centers. The Leaf Data System, as configured for Pennsylvania, permits growers and processors to begin cultivating, growing, and processing activities as soon as possible. This platform also integrates a third-party SaaS registry from Oracle for patients, caregivers, practitioners and medical providers with our seed to sale system to track patient dispensary activity in the state.
 
On January 30, 2017, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (“PADOH”), together with Pennsylvania’s Office of Information Technology Bureau of IT Procurement accepted our bid to provide a hosted SaaS medical marijuana seed to sale tracking system and awarded us a service contract. We, as the prime contractor for this contract, provides all services and meets the requirements requested by PADOH, except the production of the Medical Marijuana Patient and Caregiver identification cards, which is provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. These specific services are provided through our Leaf Data Systems product, which monitors, controls and reports on activities of authorized growers/processors, dispensaries, laboratories, clinical registrants and academic clinical research centers. Additionally, the services provided to the Commonwealth by us includes implementation of a hosted, SaaS registry for patients, caregivers, practitioners and medical providers, which is integrated with Leaf Data Systems as necessary to track patient dispensary activity. The term of the purchase order which was issued under the contract commenced on April 18, 2017, with an initial term of five years and the option for three (3) consecutive one-year renewals at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s (the “Commonwealth”) discretion. The Commonwealth may exercise the renewal(s) in single or multiple year increments, at any time during the purchase order. Termination of the contract will occur at contract closeout and all data collected and stored in our systems will be transferred to PADOH without cost within 30 calendar days in a format agreed upon by the Commonwealth. Termination by the Commonwealth can occur in whole or any part at any time for certain prescribed reasons, including our failure to provide services as and when required, our failure to dedicate sufficient resources, including personnel, equipment and material, to the completion of prescribed services and unsatisfactory performance in the judgment of the Commonwealth. In addition, the Commonwealth can terminate the contract without cause for convenience upon 30 days’ notice if it determines that termination is in the best interest of the Commonwealth.
 
Agreement with State of Utah
 
In August 2019, we entered into a State of Utah Contract (the “Utah Contract”) with the Department of Technology Services (“DTS”), for MJF’s provision of the Leaf Data System. The Utah Contract provides for provision of our Leaf Data System and Trace Seed to Sale Solution, specifically customized for the State of Utah to include an electronic verification system and inventory control system that includes customer relationship management technology. The systems will utilize solo sciences’ solo*TAG™, the world’s first cryptographically-secure, cannabis product authentication system, exclusively for governments, as an alternative to RFID tracking.
 
The Utah Contract also provides for us to undertake the work necessary to implement and integrate the Leaf Data system with DTS, with a subscription for maintenance and other services by us thereafter. The purpose of such implementation and integration is for a “Seed to Sale” inventory control system and electronic verification system to facilitate the electronic monitoring of the state’s medical cannabis industry; and supporting functionality to register, approve, provide system credentials and administer patients, caregivers, practitioners and medical providers. The initial term of the Utah Contract for performance of such implementation and integration is effective as of August 12, 2019, and terminates on August 1, 2024, with an initial term of five (5) years and the option for three (3) consecutive one-year renewals at the State of Utah’s discretion.
 
7

 

The Utah Contract provides for timelines for production, roll out, and operational implementation.
 
We expect the inventory control system to be fully rolled out and operational by the end of calendar year 2019 and the electronic verification system to be to be fully rolled out and operational between March and June 2020. Once the initial phases provided in the Utah Contract are complete, the DTS is expected to move into subscription services. Suspension or termination of the Utah Contract by DTS can occur in whole or any part at any time for certain prescribed reasons, including our breach of the contract, for the convenience by either party or the failure of State of Utah to allocate funds in its budget for the Utah Contract.
 
MJ Platform
 
We provide state-licensed dispensaries, cultivators, manufacturers, and distributors with a data-driven seed-to-sale tracking platform, MJ Platform, which provides clients with an enterprise resource planning solution for managing their inventory and regulatory compliance. We believe that the product can scale to serve businesses of varying size, whether a small boutique shop, a large multi-state company or a multi-country business, and is available in English, Spanish and French. MJ Platform is used by customers to compliantly track inventory through all phases of the seed-to-sale cycle – from cultivation to extraction and infusion to distribution and retail sales. Data points are collected at every stage of the product lifecycle and about multiple aspects of the plant’s growing environment, manufacturing processes and ingredients, as well as retail pricing and purchase data.
 
Every stage of the product lifecycle has costs attached to it, including building, labor, nutrients, lighting, water, and other, sometimes hidden, expenses. For enterprises at scale, managing costs becomes an increasingly important part of sustainability. MJ Platform allows users to track costs with specificity – by the day, by the hour, by the method, by the employee, by the product line, and by the square foot of facility space.
 
We service licensed cannabis operators in all verticals of the industry, including cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and retail dispensaries. We believe our ability to service Multi-State Operators (“MSOs”), Licensed Producers (“LPs”) with multiple verticals, as well as individual operators in the cultivation and manufacturing verticals differentiates us from other cannabis industry software providers that typically do not provide solutions for these types of businesses. We have significant client presence for our commercial software solutions in mature cannabis markets such as Arizona, California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, Maryland, Vermont and Puerto Rico, as well as Spain.
 
The Company has exclusivity in the Pennsylvania market due to its government contract, which requires operators in the state to use not only the Company’s track and trace system Leaf Data Systems but also the Company’s seed to sale tracking ERP product MJ Platform.
 
Cultivation
 
The cultivation module in MJ Platform allows licensed cultivators to quickly get ground-level details about plant strain creation and plant growth location, together with enterprise-level costing and yield projection modeling.
 
The following summarizes MJ Platform’s functionality, utility, and monitoring capabilities through the cultivation stages:
 

● | Creating plants. Cultivators use MJ Platform to identify strains of plants based on various phenotypes and to monitor and track genetics from a particular Mother Plant, thus allowing the Mother Plant and its progeny to be tracked genetically and by strain/phenotype performance over generations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growing plants. MJ Platform allows cultivators to view and track high-level details about the plants they have in the propagation, vegetation, and flowering stages, with the added ability to dive into an individual plant or group of plants. Cultivators can quickly move large batches of plants through the plant life cycle (vegetation/flowering stages) or individual plants can be moved if those plants need more or less time in a particular stage while keeping track of all inventory and monitoring regulatory compliance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Harvesting plants. When plants have finished the flowering stage and are ready to be harvested, those plants can be reviewed through the platform as a group or individually. At this time, the overall harvest weight is entered, with corresponding waste weights. Both harvested and waste material are inventoried and tracked, allowing the business and the governing body, such as the state regulatory agency, to know where all such material is at any given time. Additionally, the harvest can be graded for quality, which allows for an evaluation of the genetics of the plant strain and the growing conditions within the cultivation facility. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Packaging harvest. After the harvest has gone through its various drying and curing stages, it will be ready to be either sold wholesale by the commercial business for extraction purposes or sent to a retail facility. At this point, “harvest lots” are created based on the variation of cannabis flower that the cultivation facility deals with (e.g., bulk flower, trim, prepacks, etc.) and each lot is inventoried, tracked and monitored. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Testing product. Test results can be added for products in order to track cannabinoid potency, terpenes, microbials, residual solvents, heavy metals, mycotoxins, pesticides, and foreign materials. This information can then be used for business or customer facing labeling. All test results become part of the data record and is monitorable. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Distributing to extraction or retail facilities. When product is ready to be distributed to an extraction facility (to run extractions and produce concentrates) or a retail facility (to be sold to patients or consumers), it can be sent out on a transfer, at which point the inventory will be removed from the system and the MJ Platform has done its job of helping the customer ensure compliance. Most U.S. States require a transport manifest be created and filed at this time as well, which MJ Platform does. If this cultivation facility and the facility to which the product is being transferred are under the same parent company, a corresponding purchase order will be created at that receiving facility, easily allowing that facility to receive the inventory. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Extraction and Infusion (E&I)
 
The following summarizes MJ Platform’s functionality, utility, and monitoring capabilities through the extraction and infusion stages:
 

● | Receiving inventory. When licensed extraction facilities are sent organic materials, such as raw cannabis plants, from other facilities in order to run extractions or processing on that material, the MJ Platform allows the extraction facility to easily receive that inventory into their system through a purchase order. The extraction facility is able to locate the vendor sending them product via the “vendor network” integrated into the MJ Platform, at which point the products they typically receive from the vendor will automatically be displayed. This allows the E&I facility to carefully track the products being sent by each vendor. Any payments made during the transfer are recorded in the MJ Platform and become part of the monitorable data. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Extracting and processing. Monitoring and accounting data for each of the varying pieces of equipment used in cannabis processing jobs can be added to MJ Platform. As equipment is used to transform cannabis material into cannabis oil, live resin, and other products, that processing time is deducted from that equipment’s overall life expectancy, allowing for true product costing capabilities. MJ Platform allows the user to select monitoring of particular starting material to be extracted and processed and the platform will present only the relevant information. Additionally, the platform can monitor individual employee tasking, job completion timelines and process efficiency. 


● | Viewing multiple processing jobs. Larger E&I facilities have more equipment and therefore will have various processes running in various machines at the same time. MJ Platform allows for an E&I facility manager to view and modify details about all of the active processes running in each machine at any point in time. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Inventory listing. E&I facilities have inventory in various stages of processing at any point in time. Cannabis flower may be in the process of being extracted into oil, distilled to achieve high levels of purity, or packaged into a final product. Therefore, it becomes necessary for an E&I facility manager to see in which stage all of this inventory resides at various times and to be able to accurately and immediately track such inventory. The E&I inventory listing within MJ Platform has these inventory stages set up into buckets, which include pre-run, curing infusion concentrate and finished product. This inventory bucketing structure takes the guess work out of knowing where various products are in the extraction and processing phases, ensuring efficient state compliance and the meeting of product “finishing” timelines. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Completing processing jobs. When the processing job has completed, the output product(s) are selected and the new quantity of the output product are captured and become part of the compliance and monitorable data log. Quality ratings can also be assigned at this time to capture product color, clarity, aroma, consistency. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assembling a final product. Once the varying extraction and processing jobs have been run and the output material is in its final form, the final product (such as cartridges, concentrates, oil capsules) can then be assembled for the final patient or consumer. Within MJ Platform, assemblies are monitored based on the facility’s operating procedures. For example, if cartridges are to be filled and packaged, the pre-built platform assembly would contain the appropriate amount of cannabis oil, an empty cartridge, MCT Oil for dilution, and a box to house the cartridge. All of these components are monitored in MJ Platform with their corresponding costs and inventory levels, with the location of each components identifiable and monitored. As employees assemble these cartridges, they will know which components are needed (and monitor the adequacy of inventory levels) and pull from existing inventory (or reorder inventory as necessary). The pre-built assemblies also allow for the comparison of expected cost/completion times relative to actual cost/completion times. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Testing product. In MJ Platform, product testing can be monitored and recorded at any stage of inventory (pre-run, curing, infusion concentrate and finished product). Certain states require tests to be completed at each stage of the cannabis product for consumer sales. For example, if an E&I facility is producing cartridges, it may be necessary to test the oil in the curing stage, the infusion concentrate stage, and the final finished product stage. MJ Platform is easily adaptable for these requirements and provides for traceability and compliance monitoring from one stage to another. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Distributing to retail locations. Once the E&I facility has finished taking in cannabis flower and outputting product, the E&I facility wholesales that product to retail facilities to be sold to patients and consumers. These transactions are recorded by MJ Platform and are monitorable by state governments and other governing bodies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retail
 
The following summarizes MJ Platform’s functionality, utility, and monitoring capabilities through the retail stages:
 

● | Receiving inventory. The process for receiving inventory at the licensed retail facility is the same as at the E&I and cultivation facilities. The licensed vendor sending the product can be easily located via the retail facility’s vendor network, at which point the products which are typically received from this vendor will automatically be displayed on the MJ Platform and tracking of same continues. Any payments made during this transfer are recorded and become part of the monitorable data. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Creating customer records. Licensed retail facilities use MJ Platform to create a record of each customer and capture relevant customer information, including medical history, purchase history, and overall spending. MJ Platform provides retail facilities with the ability to capture demographic information (e.g., phone, email, address, driver’s license and medical ID) and special grouping information (e.g., veteran, senior and repeat customer), which can be used by commercial business to determine any product pricing adjustments, and allows compliance with all customer record keeping requirements. 


● | Tracking sales to customers/patients. Whether a retail facility handles in-store orders, phone orders or third-party online orders, MJ Platform records all sales finalized at or through the retail facility, including amounts of product sold, prices, inventory identification, and the employees handling and delivering product. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adding products to an order. As orders are placed, MJ Platform records all package labeling, retail location and patient or customer information to the monitorable data for the commercial business. MJ Platform also assists clients in the provision of accurate labeling based on information input by the client. Depending on an inventory manager’s need for inventory restriction, packages can be moved within the system to various sales and storage locations to allow them to be visible to (or hidden from) the retail employees completing the sale in order to ensure compliance. In fact, the software can prevent the retail employee from compliantly recording an inventory sale which is not in the virtual sales location to which they’ve been assigned. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enforcing purchase limits. Certain jurisdictions have restrictions on the amount of cannabis or cannabis derivatives which can be purchased during a given time period. MJ Platform allows for retail managers to set limits for their facility while providing the flexibility to override the limits for certain patient-based medical need. If product sale would put an end patient or customer over the applicable purchase limit, MJ Platform provides a warning message to the retail employee and the product is prevented from being compliantly recorded as a sale. Additionally, retail employees see a running total of the amount of cannabis material currently allocated to a patient or customer, allowing for tailored product choices based on the patient or customer’s remaining purchasable amount. If this retail facility’s parent company has multiple retail locations, all of these locations can be linked together to prevent “looping,” ensuring patients or customers aren’t purchasing their full limit at one location then purchasing additional product at another location. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Paying for orders. MJ Platform does not sell or handle cannabis products and does not process any payments for same but can integrate with the client facilities’ payment processors to record all transactions to further enhance state compliance data sets. Currently, there are no U.S. clients who have any integration to payment processing through MJ Platform and only Canadian clients have the ability to integrate to payment processors to receive data back to record a sale. In the U.S., MJ Platform simply records that a sale was made for compliance purposes. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Printing customer labels and receipts. MJ Platform allows for easy printing of labels that can be attached to the products or handed to the customer. Certain jurisdictions require such materials to be given to the customer for law enforcement purposes. Labels can be easily customized within MJ Platform to suit the needs of changing laws. Certain jurisdictions may require “mandated statements” on patient labels which apply to the whole order or which may apply only to certain product categories. Instead of hardcoding these statements, MJ Platform empowers retail personnel to remain in compliance by allowing them to build out their own global label statements, category statements, subcategory statements to allow them to quickly pivot based on new rules or regulations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Intelligence
 
We have two data products: The MJ Platform Business Intelligence (“BI”); and Akerna Acumen Big Data, which both leverage the extensive data captured in each of MJ Platform’s cultivation, E&I, distribution and retail modules.
 
BI gives MJ Platform clients access to aggregate data across their organization to keep track of emerging legal and commercial trends, allowing for informed actionable insights at various levels within the organization, including room, location, state, brand and administration. MJ Platform allows users to align their operational data from three vantage points: in real-time, past trends, and predictive future. This proprietary database assists user in making important decisions in real-time with respect to product monitoring, tracking, planning and pricing.
 
BI is monetized through the provision of Data Analytics subscriptions to clients. The Company typically grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable license to use our industry data for internal management, reporting and business optimization purposes. The information typically supplied to clients is aggregated and anonymized information regarding products, which may or may not be those of the client, sold through sales generated through our online service platforms.


During the cultivation phase, the platform allows for yield and cycle management forecasting. The platform leverages plant growth cycle and expected harvest yield data from the propagation, vegetation and flowering stages to forecast when there will be on-hand inventory for various products, allowing for ramp up in cultivation staffing and marketing/pre-selling of the inventory.
 
During the E&I phase, the platform allows the licensed facility to monitor product efficiency and product quality. It provides the facility manager with insight into the efficiency and quality of extraction, processing, and assembly jobs by employee, and enables the manager to determine with employees are achieving the highest yielded product output, and which are achieving product output with the highest quality ratings.
 
During the retail phase, the platform allows licensed retail locations to run consumer and patient analytics by tracking sales data relative to purchaser information, such as age, gender, zip code, discounts and coupons redeemed, and date of product sale. The platform helps compliantly monitor and track retail locations retention efforts with existing patients or customers by tracking and reporting on the client’s targeted marketing and advertising efforts. The platform also allows retail location managers to view details about product sales by type, strain, vendor and consumer type, allowing for reorder and pricing of products based on data. The tracking of this data also allows retail locations to evaluate gross profit trends. The platform also provides high-level sales data about daily, weekly and monthly sales, sales by payment type, sales by retail employee, sales by product and strain type, sales by consumer segment, and other metrics.
 
We believe we have cultivated a substantial legal cannabis dataset with nearly $16 billion   in sales tracked and 10 years of data across 20+ states and multiple countries. With the contractual ability to aggregate and anonymize this data, we have launched the Akerna Acumen product to provide banks, investors, researchers, cannabis businesses and non-cannabis businesses with cannabis market intelligence and valuable market comparison data. The data is available in various formats and is available with updates as frequently as daily.
 
Partner Integrations
 
MJ Platform is built on a microservices architecture. This structure has a number of benefits, including the ability to segregate certain pieces of the service in order to allow for those pieces to be easily accessed by third-party services. For example, we recently entered into a partnership with solo sciences and Isolocity to bring increased supply chain visibility and compliance to clients. The Isolocity partnership enables cannabis enterprises to pursue international expansion by providing a QMS framework to support local and national compliance needs. By leveraging Isolocity’s QMS, MJ Platform supports GMP certification requirements, including the stricter EU-GMP standard required for the export of medical cannabis into Europe and Asia.

The solo sciences partnership expands our reach across the cannabis supply chain visibility and transparency to the consumer to point-of-purchase and post-purchase feedback. The partnership also includes a proprietary tracking technology, solo*TAG™, that provides a more cost-effective and secure alternative to RFID. The technology is exclusively only available from solo and Leaf Data Systems.
 
As a result of MJ Platform being fully built along Representational State Transfer (“REST”) APIs, we are able to add valuable functionality through integration and strategic partners. The partnerships allow us to offer far more value to clients at a lower development cost to the company and serves as a source of accretive referral revenue to MJ Platform.
 
Consulting
 
Our experienced services team assists our government regulatory and business clients in integrating our platforms into their respective operations and systems. 
 
Entering the cannabis industry is a significant undertaking. We work with clients to efficiently comply with state requirements in connection with the launch and operations of their cannabis businesses. Our management and key personnel bring deep cannabis industry experience to us. Our management team and key personnel have broad experience gained form working with numerous cannabis operations. Our consulting team has experience in every aspect of cannabis operations in every vertical (e.g., cultivation, processing and retail). Our team members have previously managed projects, including cultivation facilities exceeding 100,000 square feet, retail operations with locations in multiple states and online businesses serving an entire country.
 
We provide project-focused consulting services to clients that are initiating or expanding their cannabis businesses or are interested in data consulting engagements regarding the legal cannabis industry. We typically provides our consulting services to clients in emerging markets that are seeking consultation on newly introduced licensing regimes and assistance with the regulatory compliant build-out of operations in newly opened states.
 
We consult with clients on a wide range of areas to help them successfully operate in the cannabis industry in compliance with state law, including:
 

● | reviewing plant and product procedures to ensure compliance and safety, as well as create greater safeguards against diversion (for example, the redirection of medicinal marijuana to a recreational user sales); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | providing role-based, recorded training customized for clients’ businesses and personnel with an emphasis on the applicable state regulatory scheme; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | writing license applications and compliance programs. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------

Strategy
 
We intend to pursue additional growth through organic initiatives, including increased marketing personnel and resources, acquisitions, and strategic relationships. Key elements of our strategy include:
 

● | expanding into new states and countries acquiring new commercial and government clients with a seed-to-sale solution that meets in-market compliance requirements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | capitalizing on the rapidly growing hemp CBD market with marketing investment and additional feature development; 
● | acquiring additional data services clients and expanding data features and data points collected across the supply chain; 

 
13

 


● | expanding services offerings among existing customers 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | exploiting the network effect that results from our strong position in the compliance technology and inventory management market for the cannabis supply chain; 


● | enhancing our systems infrastructure and data security systems; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishing strategic partnerships to provide greater value to clients through increased data collection 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | expanding our products to other organic material industries in the United States and aboard; leveraging our first-to-market position and utilizing our long-standing relationships with thousands of growers, cultivators, dispensaries and government agencies, to continue to develop and sell our platforms and related products and services; and 


● | making strategic acquisitions to enhance product and service offerings and marketing breadth. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Government Regulation
 
We do not grow, handle, process or sell cannabis or cannabis-derived products, nor do we ever possess any such material or process any transactions related to the sale of same. We only provides a technology platform for our clients to ensure their compliance with state law, and to monitor and control their inventory in compliance with state regulatory environments. We do not receive any commissions from sale by our clients and our revenue generation is not based on the sales of cannabis product by our clients, but rather we generate revenues through a set-fee based subscription revenue model. We are not directly subject to state or federal government drug regulation and our products are only intended to be used to ensure compliance with applicable state law under which clients operate. Our clients are subject to state and federal law as it relates to cannabis growth, processing and sale. 33 U.S. states have legalized cannabis in some form. Cannabis, however, is still deemed illegal under federal law. The federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. § 811), which does not recognize the difference between medical and recreational use of cannabis.
 
We believe the existing and emerging state and federal regulatory landscape creates opportunities for us platforms. We are awarded contracts with our government regulatory clients for our products and services through the process of competitive bidding. This process begins when we first learn, formally or otherwise, of a potential contract from a prospective government customer and concludes after all negotiations are completed upon award. When preparing our response to a prospective customer for a potential contract, we evaluate the contract requirements and determine and outline the services and products that we can provide to fulfill the contract at a competitive price.
 
Our government contracts and sub-contracts are subject to the procurement rules and regulations of the individual states. Many of the contract terms are dictated by these rules and regulations. During and after the fulfillment of a government contract, we may be audited in respect of the direct and allocated indirect costs attributed thereto. These audits may result in adjustments to our contract costs. Additionally, we may be subject to government inquiries and investigations because of our participation in government procurement. Any inquiry or investigation can result in fines or limitations on our ability to continue to bid for government contracts and fulfill existing contracts.
 
The applicable state government generally has the ability to terminate our contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. If a government contract were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. The state government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for our convenience. In the event of a stop work order, we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract.
 
In order to obtain a government contract for the Leaf Data Systems, we are required to follow a competitive bidding process in each state where we seek a contract. Any government contract awarded to us could require us:
 

● | to expend material time and money ahead of receipt of revenues thereunder; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to be become subject to potential audits and reviews by government agencies; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to reserve for potential liabilities under such contracts for periods longer than under private, commercial contracts. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Privacy & Customer Data
 
Regulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) that took effect in May 2018, impose new obligations directly on us as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which will take effect in January 2020, continue to evolve and could expose us to further regulatory burdens. Further, laws such as the EU’s proposed e-Privacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals’ online activities.
 
14

 

Although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these developments, such as GDPR and CCPA readiness, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through higher potential penalties for non-compliance. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers’ ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from or commitments to customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.
 
Furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding data privacy and may cause our customers or our customers’ customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.
 
Competition
 
We compete with numerous companies in the cannabis industry that offer services that are similar to some of our services, including, but not limited to, Acumatica, BDS Analytics, BioTrackTHC, Canna Advisors, Cannabis 365, Cova Cannabis, Denver Relief, Flowhub, Greenbits, Guardian, Headset Medicine Man, Metrc, New Frontier, Nextec, 3C, Treez , Trelis and TILT Holdings. We also directly compete with Kind Financial, a company offering substantively similar services to us and which has partnered with Microsoft to deliver such services in the United States.
 
We face competition in each of the revenue segments in which we operate. We believe, however, that we possess relative strengths in each segment that provide us with competitive advantages, including:
 

● | the range of services offered by us; 
--+-----------------------------------------


● | our management personnel and their industry knowledge and experience; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our proprietary databases, which are only available to users of our platforms and consulting services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Range of Services
 
We believe that we possess a unique viewpoint into the industry because we offer solutions to, and works with, both commercial businesses and government regulatory agencies towards the common goal of ensuring regulatory compliance and real-time monitoring of inventory and sales. We offer a complete range of both software and services to meet these needs for both state governments and commercial businesses. While we do not face competition from firms focusing on specific subsets of our markets, there are a very limited number of competitors providing products or services that compete with our complete range of products and services. We compete with software companies offering a product to businesses only in a certain geographic region or of a certain business type. We also compete with consulting firms serving a specific phase of the cannabis plant lifecycle.
Industry Knowledge and Experience
 
Our management personnel have extensive technical and business operations knowledge and experience within the cannabis industry, which has been developed through numerous years of service in key roles with a broad range of cannabis companies, both in terms of product and service type and size. We leverage this knowledge and experience to guide our product and service development and delivery. Our management team possesses significant compliance expertise, allowing us to continually monitor changes in legislation and regulation within the markets we and our customers operate. We face competition from companies who have teams with technical expertise or cannabis industry experience, but there are a limited number of competitors who have both and which understand the interplay between software and technical development and the application of same to the evolving cannabis compliance landscape.
Proprietary Databases
 
Nine years of operations has provided us with a statistically significant dataset of cannabis transaction information that we believe cannot be readily duplicated by new entrants into the marketplace. This growing database includes proprietary sales, market trends, customer preferences, pricing and regulatory data. We use this dataset to more accurately predict trends in the marketplace and makes this dataset available to users of our platforms, providing greater utility to customers in this regard than can be provided by competing platforms.
 
15

 

Size Compared to Direct Competitors
 
Based on numerous private and public sources, including state tax rolls and comparative industry websites, such as https://www.owler.com/company/mjfreeway, we contend that we are the largest competitor in the software-based compliance and inventory monitoring industry with respect to the cannabis industry. The comparative data available indicates that we are at the top of the industry in terms of annual revenues and number of employees. Additionally, we have one of the longest operating histories in the industry amongst these competitors, and holds the largest global footprint amongst these competitors, having served cannabis operators in 29 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and 14 countries globally dating back to 2010.
 
The additional capital resources will allow us to pursue an acquisition strategy in order to accelerate growth. The industry in which we participate is highly fragmented, with many small and thinly-capitalized competitors. As part of our growth strategy, we may seek to acquire assets or companies that are synergistic with our business. We have built a scalable infrastructure to support both rapid organic growth and targeted acquisitions. By providing the full seed-to-sale solution, we believe we are well-positioned to be an acquirer of cannabis technology solutions throughout the supply chain.
 
Company Information
 
The Business Combination
 
On October 10, 2018 (as amended on April 17, 2019), we (f/k/a MTech Acquisition Holdings Inc.) entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with MTech Acquisition Corp. (“MTech”), MJ Freeway, LLC (“MJF”), MTech Purchaser Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akerna (“Purchaser Merger Sub”), MTech Company Merger Sub LLC, a Colorado limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akerna (“Company Merger Sub”), MTech Sponsor LLC (“MTech Sponsor”), a Florida limited liability company, in the capacity as the representative for our equity holders (other than the Sellers) thereunder, and MJF and Jessica Billingsley (as successor to Harold Handelsman), in the capacity as the representative for the Sellers thereunder. The Merger Agreement provided for two mergers: (i) the merger of Purchaser Merger Sub with and into MTech, with MTech continuing as the surviving entity (the “Purchaser Merger”); and (ii) the merger of -Company Merger Sub with and into MJF, with MJF continuing as the surviving entity (the “Company Merger” and together with the Purchaser Merger, the “Business Combination”).
 
The merger consideration was paid in shares of our common stock (the “Consideration Shares”) at a price per share equal to $10.16 per share. In total, 6,520,099 Consideration Shares were issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement. All of the Consideration Shares are subject to the terms of the Lock-Up Agreement (as defined below). In addition, 652,010 of the Consideration Shares (the “Escrow Shares”) are held in an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) to cover any adjustments to the Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or claims for indemnification pursuant to the Merger Agreement until ninety (90) days after we file this Annual Report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with the exception of Escrow Shares held to satisfy then pending claims which shall remain in the Escrow Account until the claims are resolved. In addition, 215,063 of the Consideration Shares are subject to restricted stock agreements with varying vesting terms that reflect the vesting conditions application to equity interests of the applicable MJF equity holders at the time of the Business Combination.
 
In connection with the Merger Agreement, all recipients of the Consideration Shares executed a lock-up agreement (the “Lock-up Agreement”).  Pursuant to the Lock-up Agreement, each holder agreed not to engage in any transfer or other transaction with respect to the Consideration Shares for a period of time.  With respect to 50% of the Consideration Shares, each holder agreed not to engage in a transfer or other transaction until the earlier of (1) one year from the closing of the Business Combination and (2) the date on which we close a subsequent corporate transaction with an unaffiliated third party that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property.  With respect to the remaining 50% of the Consideration Shares, each holder agreed not to engage in a transfer or other transaction until the earlier of (1) one year from the closing the Business Combination, (2) the date on which we close a subsequent corporate transaction with an unaffiliated third party that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property and (3) the date on which the closing share price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for any twenty trading days with any thirty trading day period.  The third condition in the immediately preceding sentence was met and as such, there is no longer a lock-up with respect to 50% of the Consideration Shares.
 
On June 17, 2019, MTech held a Special Meeting at which the MTech stockholders considered and approved, among other matters, the Merger Agreement. On June 17, 2019, the parties consummated the Business Combination.
 
16

 

At the Special Meeting, holders of 4,452,042 shares of MTech’s common stock sold in its initial public offering (the “Public Shares”), or 99 stockholders of MTech, exercised their right to redeem those shares for cash at a price of $10.23841733 per share, for an aggregate of $45,581,864 (which represented 77.98% of the funds held in the trust account of MTech on the date of the Special Meeting). Upon closing of the Business Combination, MTech’s units ceased trading, and our common stock and warrants began trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbols “KERN” and “KERNW,” respectively, we changed our name from MTech Acquisition Holdings Inc. to “Akerna Corp.”, and MJF became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Immediately after giving effect to the Business Combination (including as a result of the redemptions described above and the transfer of the 100,120 Transferred Sponsor Shares (as defined below) pursuant to the Sponsor Stock Transfer Agreement (as defined below)) and the issuance of an additional 901,074 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.2 million in the Private Placement (as defined below) consummated in connection with the Business Combination, there were 10,400,381 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 5,993,750 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. As of the closing date of the Business Combination, the former securityholders of MJF beneficially owned approximately 62.7% of our outstanding shares of our common stock, the former securityholders of MTech beneficially owned approximately 27.7% of our outstanding shares of our common stock, and the Investors (as defined below) beneficially owned approximately 9.6% of our outstanding shares of our common stock. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, our management and principal stockholders beneficially owned approximately 59.70% of our outstanding shares of our common stock.
 
As noted above, the per share redemption price of $10.23841733 for holders of Public Shares electing redemption was paid out of MTech’s trust account, which had a balance immediately prior to closing of the Business Combination of approximately $58.9 million. MTech’s trust account was also reduced by approximately $4.4 million in order to satisfy obligations to vendors for services performed in connection with the Business Combination. In addition, MTech obtained approximately $9.2 million in proceeds from the Private Placement (as defined below), immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination. We received proceeds of approximately $18 million upon the consummation of the Business Combination and the Private Placement, net of the payments to redeeming MTech stockholders of approximately $45.6 million, third party vendors of approximately $4.4 million, and additional capital raised in the Private Placement of $9.2 million.
 
Upon the closing of the Business Combination, the outstanding Common Units, Preferred Units, and Profit Interest Units of MJF were exchanged for shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio of one Unit of MJF to 0.26716 shares of Akerna common stock (the “Exchange Ratio). Except as otherwise noted, all common share amounts and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect this Exchange Ratio, which was effected upon the Merger.
 
The Business Combination has been accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

The accompanying financial statements and related notes reflect the historical results of MJF prior to the merger and of the combined company following the Mergers, and do not include the historical results of MTech prior to the completion of the Mergers. 
 
The Private Placement
 
In connection with the Business Combination, from June 5, 2019, through June 10, 2019, MTech entered into subscription agreements (each, a “Subscription Agreement”) with certain investors, whereby the investors named therein (the “Investors”) committed to purchase an aggregate of 901,074 shares of common stock of MTech for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.2 million (the “Private Placement”). Upon the closing of the Business Combination, such shares issued by MTech in the Private Placement (“Private Placement Shares”) were automatically converted into shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.
 
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, each Investor was granted an option (the “Private Placement Option”) for a period of sixty (60) days starting after the closing of the Business Combination to purchase, subject to certain conditions, additional shares of our common stock (“Option Shares”) at a price of $10.21 per share, up to a number of Option Shares equal to the number of Private Placement Shares purchased and held and not redeemed by such Investor under the Subscription Agreement. The Private Placement Option has expired and no Investor exercised such option.
 
In connection with the execution of the Subscription Agreements, MTech Sponsor and MTech entered into an Agreement to Transfer Sponsor Shares (each, a “Sponsor Stock Transfer Agreement”) with each Investor, pursuant to which MTech Sponsor agreed to transfer to each Investor at the closing of the Private Placement one share of Class B common stock of MTech for each nine Private Placement Shares purchased by such Investor for an aggregate of 100,120 shares of common stock (such shares, the “Transferred Sponsor Shares”). Each Investor agreed to accept its portion of the Transferred Sponsor Shares subject escrow and other restrictions under the Letter Agreement, dated as of January 29, 2018, by and among MTech and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc.
