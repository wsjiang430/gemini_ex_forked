Item 1. Business
Overview
Progress Software Corporation ("Progress," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") offers the leading platform for developing and deploying strategic business applications. We enable customers and partners to deliver modern, high-impact digital experiences with a fraction of the effort, time and cost. Progress offers powerful tools for easily building adaptive user experiences across any type of device or touchpoint, award-winning machine learning that enables cognitive capabilities to be a part of any application, the flexibility of a serverless cloud to deploy modern apps, business rules, web content management, plus leading data connectivity technology. Over 1,700 independent software vendors ("ISVs"), 100,000 enterprise customers, and 2 million developers rely on Progress to power their applications.
Our products are generally sold as perpetual licenses, but certain products also use term licensing models and our cloud-based offerings use a subscription based model. More than half of our worldwide license revenue is realized through relationships with indirect channel partners, principally application partners and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). These ISVs develop and market applications using our technology and resell our products in conjunction with sales of their own products that incorporate our technology.
We operate in North America and Latin America (the "Americas"); Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and the Asia Pacific region, through local subsidiaries as well as independent distributors.
Fiscal Year 2018 Highlights
The key tenets of our strategic plan and operating model are as follows:
Align Resources to Drive Profitability. Our organizational philosophy and operating principles focus primarily on customer and partner retention and success for our core products and a streamlined operating approach in order to more efficiently drive revenue.
Protect and Strengthen Our Core Business. A key element of our strategy is centered on providing the platform and tools enterprises need to build “cognitive applications,” which we believe are the future of application development. We offer this platform to both new customers and partners as well as our existing partner and customer ecosystems. Our platform for cognitive applications enables developers to build the most modern applications quickly and easily, and includes:

• | our leading UI development tools, which enable organizations to easily build engaging user interfaces for any device or front end;


• | our NativeScript offering, which allows developers to use JavaScript to build native applications across multiple mobile platforms;


• | our modern high productivity application development platform, Progress Kinvey, that is cloud-native, is secure, high-performing, and highly-scalable while supporting all modern user interfaces;


• | automated and intuitive machine learning capabilities for accelerating the creation and delivery of cognitive applications;

4


• | our data connectivity and integration capabilities;


• | our business logic and rules capabilities; and


• | web content management for delivering personalized and engaging digital experiences

This strategy builds on our inherent DNA and our vast experience in application development that we’ve acquired over the past 35 years. 
Holistic Capital Allocation Approach. Pursuant to our capital allocation strategy, we have targeted to return approximately 75-80% of our annual cash flows from operations to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and through dividends. We have also adopted a disciplined approach to future mergers and acquisitions. By adopting strict financial criteria for future acquisitions, these acquisitions will enable us to drive significant stockholder returns by providing scale and increased cash flows.
In fiscal 2018, we remained solidly on course with the execution of our strategic plan. Our budget and operating plan for 2018 reflected our focus on managing our business as efficiently as possible. Through our sustained focus on running lean operationally, we succeeded in reducing our expenses by almost $40 million over the past two years. Further, our strategy is producing tangible benefits for stockholders. The strength of our overall business enabled us to return over $145 million of capital to stockholders in fiscal 2018 in the form of share repurchases and dividends as described below.
Share Repurchase Authorization
In September 2017, our Board of Directors increased our total share repurchase authorization to $250.0 million. In fiscal year 2018, we repurchased and retired 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $120.0 million. As of November 30, 2018, there was $100.0 million remaining under this current authorization. We intend to repurchase $100 million in shares of our common stock in fiscal year 2019. However, the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors, and we may choose to suspend, expand or discontinue the repurchase program at any time.
Dividend Declaration
On September 21, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an 11% increase to our quarterly cash dividend from $0.14 to $0.155 per share of common stock. We began paying quarterly cash dividends of $0.125 per share of common stock to Progress stockholders in December 2016 and increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.14 per share in September 2017. We have declared aggregate per share quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.575, $0.515 and $0.125 for the years ended November 30, 2018, November 30, 2017 and November 30, 2016, respectively. We have paid aggregate cash dividends totaling $25.8 million, and $24.1 million for the years ended November 30, 2018 and November 30, 2017, respectively. We expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in subsequent quarters consistent with our capital allocation strategy. However, we may terminate or modify this program at any time.
Tax Reform
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") was enacted in the United States. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Certain international provisions of the Act, including the provisions for global intangible low-taxed income and foreign-derived intangible income, will not become effective until fiscal year 2019. Refer to Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

Application Development and Deployment Business Segment
The Application Development and Deployment ("AD&D") business segment is focused on serving the evolving needs of our substantial developer community, and on generating net new customers for our application development assets. This business segment has the focus and agility of a start-up, able to react quickly to changes in this rapidly-evolving market in order to meet the demands of developers who are seeking to increase their productivity and move toward the cloud.
The solutions within the AD&D business segment include:
DevTools
DevTools is a cross-platform, user experience design, quality assurance, debugging and reporting suite for next generation web, mobile, desktop and HTML5 applications that enables developers to focus on business logic and not infrastructure. Included in DevTools are Fiddler and Kendo UI.
Sitefinity
Sitefinity is a next-generation web content management and customer analytics platform for managing and optimizing digital experiences. Sitefinity combines superior end user experience with a high level of customization capabilities for developers.
Test Studio
Test Studio is an application lifecycle management suite for testing web, mobile and desktop applications that covers the process from idea to deployment.
Product Development
Most of our products have been developed by our internal product development staff or the internal staffs of acquired companies. We believe that the features and performance of our products are competitive with those of other available development and deployment tools and that none of the current versions of our products are approaching obsolescence. However, we believe that significant investments in new product development and continuing enhancements of our current products will be required for us to maintain our competitive position.
As of November 30, 2018, we have four development offices in North America, two primary development offices in India and one primary development office in EMEA. We spent $79.7 million, $77.0 million, and $88.6 million in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on product development, including capitalized software development costs.
Customers
We market our products globally through several channels: directly to end users and indirectly to application partners (or ISVs), OEMs, and system integrators. Sales of our solutions and products through our direct sales force have historically been to business managers or IT managers in corporations and governmental agencies. We also target developers who create business applications, from individuals to teams, within enterprises of all sizes.
We also market our products through indirect channels, primarily application partners and OEMs who embed our products as part of an integrated solution. We use international distributors in certain locations where we do not have a direct presence or where it is more economically feasible for us to do so. More than half of our license revenues are derived from indirect channels.
Application Partners
Our application partners cover a broad range of markets, offer an extensive library of business applications and are a source of recurring revenue. We have kept entry costs, consisting primarily of the initial purchase of development licenses, low to encourage a wide variety of application partners to build applications. If an application partner succeeds in marketing its applications, we obtain recurring revenue as the application partner licenses our deployment products to allow its application to be installed and used by customers. In recent years, a significantly increasing amount of our revenue from application partners has been generated from subscriptions to application partners who have chosen to enable their business applications under a software-as-a-service ("SaaS") platform.

Original Equipment Manufacturers
We enter into arrangements with OEMs in which the OEM embeds our products into its solutions, typically either software or technology devices. OEMs typically license the right to embed our products into their solutions and distribute those solutions for initial terms ranging from one to three years. Historically, most of our OEMs have renewed their agreements upon the expiration of the initial term. However, there is no assurance that they will continue to renew in the future. If any of our largest OEM customers were not to renew their agreements in the future, this could materially impact our DCI segment.
No single customer or partner has accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in any of our last three fiscal years.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products and solutions through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners. We have sold our products and solutions to enterprises in over 180 countries. Our sales and field marketing groups are organized primarily by region. We operate by region in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. We believe this structure allows us to maintain direct contact with our customers and support their diverse market requirements. Our international operations provide focused local sales, support and marketing efforts and are able to respond directly to changes in local conditions.
In addition to our direct sales efforts, we distribute our products through systems integrators, resellers, distributors, and OEM partners in the United States and internationally. Systems integrators typically have expertise in vertical or functional markets. In some cases, they resell our products, bundling them with their broader service offerings. In other cases, they refer sales opportunities for our products to our direct sales force. Distributors sublicense our products and provide service and support within their territories. OEMs embed portions of our technology in their product offerings.
Sales personnel are responsible for developing new direct end user accounts, recruiting new indirect channel partners and new independent distributors, managing existing channel partner relationships and servicing existing customers. We actively seek to avoid conflict between the sales efforts of our application partners and our own direct sales efforts. We use our inside sales team to enhance our direct sales efforts and to generate new business and follow-on business from existing customers.
Our marketing personnel conduct a variety of marketing engagement programs designed to create demand for our products, enhance the market readiness of our products, raise the general awareness of our company and our products and solutions, generate leads for the sales organization and promote our various products. These programs include press relations, analyst relations, investor relations, digital/web marketing, marketing communications, participation in trade shows and industry conferences, and production of sales and marketing literature. We also hold and participate in global events, as well as regional user events in various locations throughout the world.
Our sales and marketing efforts with respect to certain of our products, including DevTools, differ from our traditional sales and marketing efforts because the target markets are different. For these products, we have designed our marketing and sales model to be efficient for high volumes of lower-price transactions. Our marketing efforts focus on driving traffic to our websites and on generating high quality sales leads, in many cases, consisting of developer end users who download a free evaluation of our software. Our sales efforts then focus on converting these leads into paying customers through a high volume, short duration, sales process. Of particular importance to our target market, we enable our customers to buy our products in a manner convenient to them, whether by purchase order, online with a credit card or through our channel partners.
Customer Support
Our customer support staff provides telephone and Web-based support to end users, application developers and OEMs. Customers may purchase maintenance services entitling them to software updates, technical support and technical bulletins. Maintenance is generally not required with our products and is purchased at the customer's option. We provide support to customers primarily through our main regional customer support centers in Bedford and Waltham, Massachusetts; Morrisville, North Carolina; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Hyderabad, India; Melbourne, Australia; and Sofia, Bulgaria. Local technical support for specific products is provided in certain other countries as well.

Professional Services
Our global professional services organization delivers business solutions for customers through a combination of products, consulting and education. Our consulting organization offers project management, implementation services, custom development, programming and other services. Our consulting organization also provides services to Web-enable existing applications or to take advantage of the capabilities of new product releases. Our education organization offers numerous training options, from traditional instructor-led courses to advanced learning modules available via the web or on CDs.
Our services offerings include: application modernization; data management, managed database services; performance enhancements and tuning; and analytics/business intelligence. 
Competition
The computer software industry is intensely competitive. We experience significant competition from a variety of sources with respect to all of our products. Factors affecting competition in the markets we serve include product performance in complex applications, breadth of application solutions, vendor experience, ease of integration, price, training and support.
We compete in various markets with a number of entities, such as salesforce.com, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Software AG, RedHat, Inc., Pivotal Software, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation and other smaller firms. Many of these vendors offer platform-as-a-service, application development, data integration and other tools in conjunction with their CRM, web services, operating systems and relational database management systems. We believe that IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation currently dominate the relational database market. We do not believe that there is a dominant vendor in the other infrastructure software markets, including application development. Some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing or technical resources than we have and/or may have experience in, or be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. Increased competition could make it more difficult for us to maintain our revenue and market presence.
Copyrights, Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We generally distribute our products under software license agreements that grant customers a perpetual nonexclusive license to use our products and contain terms and conditions prohibiting the unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our products. We also distribute our products through various channel partners, including application partners, OEMs and system integrators. We also license our products under term or subscription arrangements.  In addition, we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with employees, consultants and channel partners. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there is no assurance that these measures will be successful.
We seek to protect the source code of our products as trade secrets and as unpublished copyrighted works. We hold numerous patents covering portions of our products. We also have several patent applications for some of our other product technologies. Where possible, we seek to obtain protection of our product names and service offerings through trademark registration and other similar procedures throughout the world.
We believe that due to the rapid pace of innovation within our industry, factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel are as important in establishing and maintaining a leadership position within the industry as are the various legal protections of our technology. In addition, we believe that the nature of our customers, the importance of our products to them and their need for continuing product support may reduce the risk of unauthorized reproduction, although no assurances can be made in this regard.
Business Segment and Geographical Information
We operate and report as three distinct business segments: OpenEdge, Data Connectivity and Integration, and Application Development and Deployment. For additional information on our business segments as well as our geographical financial information, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
