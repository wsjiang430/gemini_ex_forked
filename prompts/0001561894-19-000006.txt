Item 1. | Business

GENERAL
We focus on solutions that reduce carbon emissions and increase resilience to climate change by providing capital and specialized expertise to the leading companies in the energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainable infrastructure markets. Our goal is to generate attractive returns for our shareholders by investing in a diversified portfolio of assets and projects that generate long-term, recurring and predictable cash flows or cost savings from proven commercial technologies.
We believe we were one of the first U.S. public companies exclusively focused on financing solutions to climate change. Our investments, which typically benefit from contractually committed high credit quality obligors, have taken a number of forms including equity, joint ventures, land ownership, lending or other financing transactions. We also generate ongoing fees through gain-on-sale securitization transactions, services and asset management.
We are internally managed, and our management team has extensive relevant industry knowledge and experience, dating back more than 30 years. We have long-standing relationships with the leading energy service companies (“ESCOs”), manufacturers, project developers, utilities, owners and operators. Our origination strategy is to use these relationships to generate recurring, programmatic investment and fee generating opportunities. Additionally, we have relationships with leading banks, investment banks, and institutional investors from which we are referred additional investment and fee generating opportunities.
We completed approximately $1.2 billion of transactions during 2018, compared to approximately $1.0 billion during 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately $2.0 billion of transactions on our balance sheet, which we refer to as our “Portfolio.” For those transactions that we choose not to hold on our balance sheet, we transfer all or a portion of the economics of the transaction, typically using securitization trusts, to institutional investors in exchange for a gain on the transfer and in some cases, ongoing fees. As of December 31, 2018, we managed approximately $3.3 billion in these trusts or vehicles that are not consolidated on our balance sheet. When combined with our Portfolio, as of December 31, 2018, we manage approximately $5.3 billion of assets, which we refer to as our "Managed Assets". 
We use borrowings as part of our strategy to increase potential returns to our stockholders and have available to us a broad range of financing sources including non-recourse or recourse debt, equity, and off-balance sheet securitization structures. A further description of our financing activities can be found below.
We have a large and active pipeline of potential new opportunities that are in various stages of our underwriting process. We refer to potential opportunities as being part of our pipeline if we have determined that the project fits within our investment strategy and exhibits the appropriate risk and reward characteristics through an initial credit analysis, including a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the opportunity, as well as research on the market and sponsor. Our pipeline of transactions that could potentially close in the next 12 months consists of opportunities in which we will be the lead originator as well as opportunities in which we may participate with other institutional investors. As of December 31, 2018, our pipeline consisted of more than $2.5 billion in new equity, debt and real estate opportunities. There can, however, be no assurance with regard to any specific terms of such pipeline transactions or that any or all of the transactions in our pipeline will be completed.
We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013 and operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY
With scientific consensus that climate warming trends are linked to human activities and resulting in various extreme weather events, we believe our firm is well positioned to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in, and managing a portfolio of, assets that reduce climate changing carbon emissions. Further, with increasing weather related events affecting certain of our markets, we see similar investment opportunities in infrastructure assets that mitigate the impact of, and increase the resiliency to, these weather events and climate change.
Our investment thesis is based on the following theories:

• | More efficient technologies are more productive and thus should lead to higher economic returns;


• | Lower portfolio risk is inherent in a portfolio of smaller investments, generated by trends of increasing decentralization and digitalization of energy assets, compared to larger, centralized utility-scale investments;


• | Investing in assets aligned with scientific consensus and society’s general beliefs will reduce potential regulatory and social costs through better internalization of externalities; and


• | Assets that reduce carbon emissions represent an embedded option that may increase in value if carbon regulations were to set a price on carbon emissions.

We believe combining this investment thesis with our multi-decade experience in investing in our markets through multiple interest rate and business cycles, intermittent governmental support for reducing carbon emissions and several ‘boom and bust’ cycles of business expansions in renewable and other sustainable infrastructure markets, will allow us to earn attractive risk adjusted returns on the assets we invest in. We also believe there is potentially a very large market opportunity as the legacy technology for generating and using energy with systems that produce carbon emissions are converted to low-to-no carbon emission systems and mitigation and resiliency investments continue to increase in an effort to address weather events and climate change.
Our investments are focused on three areas:

• | Behind-The-Meter ("BTM"): distributed building or facility projects, which reduce energy usage or cost through the use of solar generation and energy storage or energy efficient improvements including heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (“HVAC”), lighting, energy controls, roofs, windows, building shells, and/or combined heat and power systems;


• | Grid Connected ("GC"): projects that deploy cleaner energy sources, such as solar and wind to generate power where the off-taker or counterparty is part of the wholesale electric power grid; and 


• | Other Sustainable Infrastructure: upgraded transmission or distribution systems, water and storm water infrastructure, seismic retrofits and other projects, that improve water or energy efficiency, increase resiliency, positively impact the environment or more efficiently use natural resources.

We prefer investments where the assets have a long-term, investment grade rated off-taker or counterparties. In the case of BTM, the off-taker or counterparty may be the building owner or occupant, and we may be secured by the installed improvements or other real estate rights. In the case of GC, the off-taker or counterparty may be a utility or electric user who has entered into a contractually committed agreement, such as a power purchase agreement (“PPA”), to purchase some, or all of, the power produced by a renewable energy project at a minimum price with potential price escalators for a portion of the project’s estimated life. 
We make our investments utilizing a variety of structures including:

• | Equity investments in either preferred or common structures in unconsolidated entities;


• | Government and commercial receivables or securities, such as loans for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects; and


• | Real estate, such as land or other assets leased for use by sustainable infrastructure projects typically under long term leases.

Our equity investments in renewable energy projects are operated by various renewable energy companies or by joint ventures in which we participate. These transactions allow us to participate in the cash flows associated with these projects, typically on a priority basis. Our energy efficiency debt investments are usually assigned the payment stream from the project savings and other contractual rights, often using our pre-existing master purchase agreements with the ESCOs. Our debt

investments in various renewable energy or other sustainable infrastructure projects or portfolios of projects are generally secured by the installed improvements or other real estate rights. We also own, directly or through equity investments, over 24,000 acres of land that are leased under long-term agreements to over 50 renewable energy projects, where our rental income is typically senior to most project costs, debt, and equity. 
We focus on projects that use proven technology and that often have contractually committed agreements with an investment grade rated off-taker or counterparties. While we prefer investments in which we hold a senior or preferred position in a project, as our markets evolve and grow, we are seeing increasing opportunities to invest, and have invested, in mezzanine debt or common equity in projects where we are subordinated to project debt and/or preferred forms of equity. Investing greater than 15% of our assets in any individual project requires the approval of a majority of our independent directors. We may adjust the mix and duration of our assets over time in order to allow us to manage various aspects of our portfolio, including expected risk-adjusted returns, macroeconomic conditions, liquidity, availability of adequate financing for our assets, and to maintain our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act.
As of December 31, 2018, our Portfolio consisted of over 185 investments and we seek to manage the diversity of our Portfolio by, among other factors, project type, project operator, type of investment, type of technology, transaction size, geography, obligor and maturity. The mix of our Portfolio is expected to vary over time and approximately 49% of our Portfolio was invested in BTM assets; approximately 45% was invested in GC assets, which includes our land holdings, and approximately 6% was invested in Other Sustainable Infrastructure. 
As part of our investment process, we calculate the ratio of the estimated first year of metric tons of carbon emissions avoided by our investments divided by the capital invested to understand the impact our investments are having on climate change. In this calculation, which we refer to as CarbonCount®, we use emissions factor data, expressed on a CO2 equivalent basis, from the U.S. Government or the International Energy Administration to an estimate of a project’s energy production or savings to compute an estimate of metric tons of carbon emissions avoided. We estimate that our investments originated in 2018 will reduce annual carbon emissions by approximately 496 thousand metric tons. In addition to carbon, we also consider other environmental attributes, such as water use reduction, stormwater remediation benefits or stream restoration benefits.
We believe that our long history of energy efficiency and renewable energy investing, the experience, expertise and relationships of our management team, the anticipated credit strength of the obligors or investees of our investments and the size and growth potential of our market, position us well to capitalize on our strategy.
Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations, for additional discussion on the performance of our investment portfolio.
FINANCING STRATEGY
We believe we have available to us a broad range of financing sources as part of our strategy to increase potential returns to our stockholders. We may finance our investments through the use of non-recourse debt, recourse debt, or equity and may also decide to finance such transactions through the use of off-balance sheet securitization structures.
We have worked to expand our liquidity and access to the debt and bank loan markets and have entered into transactions with a number of new lenders and insurance companies in the last year. For example, in December 2018, we replaced our existing credit facility with two new primary credit facilities with a group of lenders, including several new lenders, that provide for a combined $450 million in borrowing capacity and a maturity in 2023. We often provide, and our sources of financing are increasingly interested in, the estimated carbon emission savings or environmental ratings associated with our financings.
We plan to raise additional equity capital and continue to use other fixed and floating rate borrowings which may be in the form of additional bank credit facilities, including term loans and revolving facilities, warehouse facilities, repurchase agreements and public and private equity and debt issuances, including convertible debt and match funded arrangements, as a means of financing our business. We also expect to use both on-balance sheet and non-consolidated securitizations and believe we will be able to customize securitized tranches to meet investment preferences of different investors. In the future, we may use corporate unsecured debt to finance our investments. We may also consider the use of separately funded special purpose entities or funds to allow us to expand the investments that we make.
The decision on how we finance specific assets or groups of assets is largely driven by capital allocations, risk, and portfolio management considerations, as well as the overall interest rate environment, prevailing credit spreads and the terms of 
- 7 -

available financing and market conditions. Over time, as market conditions change, we may use other forms of leverage in addition to these financing arrangements. Although we are not restricted by any regulatory requirements as to the type or amount of leverage we may utilize, we do have certain targets we seek to, but are not required to, operate within; including maintaining a leverage ratio at or below 2.5 to 1 and the percentage of fixed rate debt to total debt between 60% to 85%. See additional discussion at Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources regarding our ongoing evaluation of our leverage and fixed-rate debt targets.
For those transactions that we choose not to hold on our balance sheet, we transfer all or a portion of the economics of the transaction, typically using securitization trusts, to institutional investors in exchange for a gain on the transfer and in some cases, ongoing fees. As a result of increases in short-term interest rates without a corresponding increase in long-term rates which has resulted in a reduction in the difference in yield between short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates known as a flattening of the yield curve, we have increased our use of securitization transactions and expect to continue to use a higher level of these transactions in the short to intermediate-term. The market for the assets we finance has remained active throughout various market cycles due to investor demand for high credit quality, long-term investments. We may arrange such securitizations of loans or other assets prior to originating the transaction and thus avoid exposure to credit spread, interest rate and funding risks that are normally associated with traditional capital markets conduit transactions. We also typically manage and service these assets in exchange for fees. We may also use other funds or structures where institutional investors purchase all or a portion of the economics of the transaction and where we may receive upfront or ongoing fees for managing the assets. We periodically provide other services, including arranging financings that are held on the balance sheet of other investors and advising various companies with respect to structuring investments. 
Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources, for additional discussion on our financings and our ratios and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 5, 7 and 8 to our financial statements for further information on the types and amounts of our financing activities.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We own and invest in a diversified group of sustainable infrastructure projects focused on reducing or mitigating the impacts of climate change through the allocation of our capital across the energy efficiency, renewable energy and other sustainability focused markets. Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and the board of directors, we are focused on achieving a high level of environmental and social responsibility and strong corporate governance. The Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our board of directors is responsible for our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) oversight, including for our policies and communications. Additionally, we have a committee, comprised of employees from across the organization, that is focused on implementing various ESG strategies, policies and communications that reports to our Chief Executive Officer. 
Our business and business strategy are focused on addressing climate change, including through the reduction of carbon emissions. As described in the Investment Strategy section above, we estimate the carbon impact of each of our investments. In addition, we operate our business in a manner intended to reduce the environmental impact, including by purchasing carbon free electricity for our office and by encouraging recycling. In 2018, we adopted our Environmental Policies focused on our operations. We also participate in a number of climate focused initiatives including Climate Action 100+, We Are Still In and the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (“CDSB”). In 2017, we joined the CDSB’s initiative to pledge to implement the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). Additionally, in 2018, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, an initiative focused on responsible business practices related to human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. 
We are also focused on our social responsibility within our workforce and our community. In 2018, we adopted our Human Rights and Human Capital Management Policies to further our commitment to social responsibility. Our culture is focused on hiring and retaining diverse and highly talented employees and empowering them to create value for our stockholders. In our employee selection process and operation of our business we adhere to equal employment opportunity policies and encourage the participation of our employees in training programs that will enhance their effectiveness in the performance of their duties. Our Chief Executive Officer leads employee meetings intended to encourage employees to understand why sustainability matters and regularly meets with small groups of employees to receive their feedback on the business.
We provide competitive benefits that help our employees and their families be healthy and design compelling job opportunities, aligned with our mission, in an energizing work environment. We also encourage our employees to continue to 
- 8 -

develop in their careers, including by obtaining advanced degrees or professional certifications. We compensate our employees according to our fair remuneration policies and believe deeply in paying for performance. Therefore, employees generally receive a portion of their compensation in the form of stock grants tied to performance. We encourage our employees to contribute their time to support various community and charitable activities and sponsor several local community organizations with a primary focus on environmental organizations.
We have structured our corporate governance in a manner we believe closely aligns our interests with those of our stockholders. Notable features of our corporate governance structure include the following:

• | our board of directors is not staggered, with each of our directors subject to re-election annually;


• | our board of directors has determined that six of our seven directors are independent for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) corporate governance listing standards and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act;


• | two of our directors qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”);


• | two of our directors are women, constituting 29% of the board, in furtherance of our board diversity policy;


• | our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for a majority vote policy for the election of directors pursuant to which any nominee who receives a greater number of votes “withheld” from his or her election than votes “for” such election shall promptly tender his or her resignation to our board of directors, which shall consider whether or not to accept such resignation;


• | we have established a target retirement age of 75 for our directors;


• | we have an active stockholder outreach program, including providing stockholders the right to vote on the fairness of the remuneration of executives;


• | our Statement of Corporate Policy Regarding Equity Transaction prohibits our directors and officers from hedging our equity securities, holding such securities in a margin account or pledging such securities as collateral for a loan;


• | we adopted a Clawback Policy which provides for the possible recoupment of performance or incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance by us with any financial reporting requirements under the securities laws (other than due to a change in applicable accounting methods, rules or interpretations);


• | we have opted out of the control share acquisition statute in the Maryland General Corporations Law (the “MGCL”) and have exempted, from the business combinations statute in the MGCL, transactions that are approved by our board of directors;


• | we do not have a stockholder rights plan; and


• | we have expanded the role of our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee to also focus on directing the strategy and oversight of our ESG strategies, activities, policies and communications.

In order to foster the highest standards of ethics and conduct in all business relationships, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policy (the “Code of Conduct”). This policy, which covers a wide range of business practices and procedures, applies to our officers, directors and employees. In addition, we have implemented Whistleblowing Procedures related to accounting and auditing matters as well as Code of Conduct matters (the “Whistleblower Policy”) that sets forth procedures by which any Covered Persons (as defined in the Whistleblower Policy) may raise, on a confidential basis, concerns regarding, among other things, any questionable or unethical accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters with our Audit Committee as well as any potential code of conduct or ethics violations with our Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee or our General Counsel.
We have adopted a Statement of Corporate Policy Regarding Equity Transactions that governs the process to be followed in the purchase or sale of our securities by any of our directors, officers, employees and consultants and prohibits any such persons from buying or selling our securities on the basis of material nonpublic information, and also prohibits our directors and officers from hedging equity securities of the Company, holding such securities in a margin account or pledging such securities as collateral for a loan. We review all of these policies on a periodic basis with our employees.
Our business is managed by our senior management team, subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of directors. Our directors stay informed about our business by attending meetings of our board of directors and its committees and through supplemental reports and communications. Our independent directors, led by the lead independent director, meet regularly in executive sessions without the presence of our officers.

COMPETITION
We compete against a number of parties, including banks, private equity, hedge or infrastructure investment funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, specialty finance companies, utilities, independent power producers, project developers, pension funds, governmental bodies, public entities established to own infrastructure assets and other entities.
We compete primarily on the basis of service, price, structure and flexibility as well as the breadth and depth of our expertise. We may at times compete, and at other times partner or work as a participant, with alternative financing sources. The continued low interest rate environment and increasing investor acceptance of the sustainable infrastructure market has increased the level of competition we experience. The increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors in this market has resulted, and could continue to result, in less attractive terms on our investments or the need to accept a higher level of risks associated with our investments.
We also encounter competition in the form of potential customers or our origination partners electing to use their own capital rather than engaging an outside capital provider. In addition, we may also face competition based on technological developments that reduce demand for electricity, increase power supplies through existing infrastructure or that otherwise compete with our sustainable infrastructure projects.
Some of our competitors are significantly larger, have greater access to capital and other resources or enjoy other advantages in comparison to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of opportunities and establish more relationships than we can. These competitors may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints (such as REIT compliance or the need to maintain an exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act) that we face.
We believe that a significant part of our competitive advantage is our management team’s experience and industry expertise. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face, including increasing competition as a result of the increasing interest by various investors in our assets classes, including renewable energy, to enhance their investment returns. This, or other increases, in competition among competing providers of capital could adversely affect the returns we generate on our investments, and thereby adversely affect the market price of our common stock. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors—We operate in a competitive market and future competition may impact the terms of our investments.
EMPLOYEES; STAFFING
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 49 people. We intend to hire additional business professionals as needed to assist in the implementation of our business strategy.
