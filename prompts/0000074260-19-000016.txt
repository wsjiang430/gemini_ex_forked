Item 1 - Business
(a) General Description of Business. Old Republic International Corporation is a Chicago based holding company engaged in the single business of insurance underwriting and related services. It conducts its operations principally through a number of regulated insurance company subsidiaries organized into three major segments, namely, it's General Insurance Group (property and liability insurance), Title Insurance Group, and the Republic Financial Indemnity Group ("RFIG") (mortgage guaranty ("MI") and consumer credit indemnity ("CCI")) Run-off Business. References herein to such groups apply to the Company's subsidiaries engaged in these respective segments of business. The results of a small life and accident insurance business are included within the corporate and other caption of this report. "Old Republic" or "the Company" refers to Old Republic International Corporation and its subsidiaries as the context requires. 
The insurance business is distinguished from most others in that the prices (premiums) charged for various insurance products are set without certainty of the ultimate benefit and claim costs that will emerge, often many years after issuance and expiration of a policy. This basic fact casts Old Republic as a risk-taking enterprise managed for the long run. Management therefore conducts the business with a primary focus on achieving favorable underwriting results over cycles, and on the maintenance of financial soundness in support of the insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to policyholders and their beneficiaries. To achieve these objectives, adherence to insurance risk management principles is stressed, and asset diversification and quality are emphasized. The underwriting principles encompass:

• | Disciplined risk selection, evaluation, and pricing to reduce uncertainty and adverse selection;


• | Enhancing the predictability of expected outcomes through insurance of the largest number of homogeneous risks as to each type of coverage;


• | Reducing the insurance portfolio risk profile through:


• | diversification and spread of insured risks; and


• | assimilation of uncorrelated asset and liability exposures across economic sectors that tend to offset or counterbalance one another; and


• | Effective management of gross and net limits of liability through appropriate use of reinsurance.

In addition to income arising from Old Republic's basic underwriting and related services functions, significant investment income is earned from invested funds generated by those functions and from capital resources. Investment management aims for stability of income from interest and dividends, protection of capital, and for sufficiency of liquidity to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future. Securities trading and the realization of capital gains are not primary objectives. The investment philosophy is therefore best characterized as emphasizing value, credit quality, and relatively long-term holding periods. The Company's ability to hold both fixed maturity and equity securities for long periods of time is in turn enabled by the scheduling of maturities in contemplation of an appropriate matching of assets and liabilities, and by investments in large capitalization, highly liquid equity securities.
In light of the above factors, the Company's affairs are managed for the long run and without significant regard to the arbitrary strictures of quarterly or even annual reporting periods that American industry must observe. In Old Republic's view, such short reporting time frames do not comport well with the long-term nature of much of its business. Management therefore believes that the Company's operating results and financial condition can best be evaluated by observing underwriting and overall operating performance trends over succeeding five- or preferably ten-year intervals. A ten-year period in particular can likely encompass at least one economic and/or underwriting cycle and thereby provide an appropriate time frame for such cycle to run its course, and for premium rate changes and reserved claim costs to be quantified and emerge in financial results with greater finality and effect.
The contributions to consolidated revenues and pretax income, and the assets and shareholders' equity of each Old Republic segment are set forth in the following table. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and the "Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations" appearing elsewhere in this report.

General Insurance Group

Old Republic's General Insurance segment is best characterized as a commercial lines insurance business with a strong focus on liability insurance coverages. Most of these coverages are provided to businesses, government, and other institutions. The Company does not have a meaningful exposure to personal lines insurance such as homeowners and private automobile coverages, nor does it insure significant amounts of commercial or other real property. In continuance of its commercial lines orientation, Old Republic also focuses on specific sectors of the North American economy, most prominently the transportation (trucking and general aviation), commercial construction, healthcare, education, retail and wholesale trade, forest products, energy, general manufacturing, and financial services industries. In managing the insurance risks it undertakes, the Company employs various underwriting and loss mitigation techniques such as utilization of policy deductibles, captive insurance risk-sharing arrangements, and retrospective rating and policyholder dividend plans. These underwriting techniques are intended to better correlate premium charges with the ultimate claims experience of individual or groups of assureds.
Over the years, the General Insurance Group's operations have been developed steadily through a combination of internal growth, the establishment of additional subsidiaries focused on new types of coverages and/or industry sectors, and through several mergers of smaller companies. As a result, this segment has become widely diversified with a business base encompassing the following major coverages:
Automobile Extended Warranty Insurance (1992): Coverage is provided to the vehicle owner for certain mechanical or electrical repair or replacement costs after the manufacturer's warranty has expired.
Aviation (1983): Insurance policies protect the value of aircraft hulls and afford liability coverage for acts that result in injury, loss of life, and property damage to passengers and others on the ground or in the air. 
Commercial Automobile Insurance (1930's): Covers vehicles (mostly trucks) used principally in commercial pursuits. Policies cover damage to insured vehicles and liabilities incurred by an assured for bodily injury and property damage sustained by third parties. 
Commercial Multi-Peril ("CMP")(1920's): Policies afford liability coverage for claims arising from the acts of owners or employees, and protection for the physical assets of businesses.
Financial Indemnity: Multiple types of specialty coverages, including most prominently the following four, are underwritten by Old Republic within this financial indemnity products classification. 
Errors & Omissions("E&O")/Directors & Officers ("D&O")(1983): E&O liability policies are written for non-medical professional service providers such as lawyers, architects, and consultants, and provide coverage for legal expenses, and indemnity settlements for claims alleging breaches of professional standards. D&O coverage provides for the payment of legal expenses, and indemnity settlements for claims made against the directors and officers of corporations from a variety of sources, most typically shareholders.
Fidelity (1981): Bonds cover the exposures of financial institutions and commercial and other enterprises for losses of monies or debt and equity securities due to acts of employee dishonesty.
Guaranteed Asset Protection ("GAP")(2003): This insurance indemnifies an automobile loan borrower for the dollar value difference between an insurance company's liability for the total loss (remaining cash value) of an insured vehicle and the amount still owed on an automobile loan. 
Surety (1981): Bonds are insurance company guarantees of performance by a corporate principal or individual such as for the completion of a building or road project, or payment on various types of contracts.
General Liability (1920's): Protects against liability of an assured which stems from carelessness, negligence, or failure to act, and results in property damage or personal injury to others. 
Home Warranty Insurance (1981): This product provides repair and/or replacement coverage for home systems (e.g. plumbing, heating, and electrical) and designated appliances.
Inland Marine (1920's): Coverage pertains to the insurance of property in transit over land and of property which is mobile by nature.
Travel Accident (1970): Coverages provided under these policies, some of which are also underwritten by the Company's Canadian life insurance affiliate, cover monetary losses arising from trip delay and cancellation for individual insureds.
Workers' Compensation (1910's): This coverage is purchased by employers to provide insurance for employees' lost wages and medical benefits in the event of work-related injury, disability, or death.

Commercial automobile, general liability and workers' compensation insurance policy coverages are typically produced in tandem for many assureds. For 2018, production of workers' compensation direct insurance premiums accounted for approximately 31.4% of consolidated General Insurance Group direct premiums written, while commercial automobile and general liability direct premium production amounted to approximately 32.5% and 12.2%, respectively, of such consolidated totals.
Approximately 92% of general insurance premiums are produced through independent agency or brokerage channels, while the remaining 8% is obtained through direct production facilities.

Title Insurance Group

Old Republic's flagship title insurance company was founded in 1907. The Title Insurance Group's business consists primarily of the issuance of policies to real estate purchasers and investors based upon searches of the public records which contain information concerning interests in real property. The policies insure against losses arising out of defects, liens and encumbrances affecting the insured title and not excluded or excepted from the coverage of the policy. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 26% of the Company's consolidated title premium and related fee income stemmed from direct operations (which include branch offices of its title insurers and wholly owned agency subsidiaries of the Company), while the remaining 74% emanated from independent title agents and underwritten title companies.
There are two basic types of title insurance policies: lenders' policies and owners' policies. Both are issued for a one-time premium. Most mortgages made in the United States are extended by mortgage bankers, savings and commercial banks, state and federal agencies, and life insurance companies. These financial institutions secure title insurance policies to protect their mortgagees' interest in the real property. This protection remains in effect for as long as the mortgagee has an interest in the property. A separate title insurance policy may be issued to the owner of the real estate. An owner's policy of title insurance protects an owner's interest in the title to the property.
The premiums charged for the issuance of title insurance policies vary with the policy amount and the type of policy issued. The premium is collected in full when the real estate transaction is closed, there being no recurring fee thereafter. In many areas, premiums charged on subsequent policies on the same property may be reduced depending generally upon the time elapsed between issuance of the previous policies and the nature of the transactions for which the policies are issued. Most of the charge to the customer relates to title services rendered in conjunction with the issuance of a policy rather than to the possibility of loss due to risks insured against. Accordingly, the cost of services performed by a title insurer relates for the most part to the prevention of loss rather than to the assumption of the risk of loss. Claim losses that do occur result primarily from title search and examination mistakes, fraud, forgery, incapacity, missing heirs and escrow processing errors.
In connection with its title insurance operations, Old Republic also provides escrow closing and construction disbursement services, as well as real estate information products, national default management services, and a variety of other services pertaining to real estate transfers and loan transactions. As lenders and the title insurance industry transition into the evolving digital landscape of eClosings and eMortgages, Old Republic believes it is well positioned with technology and business process innovations to remain competitive in the market.

Republic Financial Indemnity Group (RFIG) Run-off Business

Old Republic's RFIG run-off business consists of its mortgage guaranty and CCI operations.
Private mortgage insurance protects mortgage lenders and investors from default related losses on residential mortgage loans made primarily to homebuyers who make down payments of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. The mortgage guaranty operation insures only first mortgage loans, primarily on residential properties incorporating one-to-four family dwelling units. Old Republic's mortgage guaranty business was started in 1973.
There are two principal types of private mortgage insurance coverage: "primary" and "pool". Primary mortgage insurance provides mortgage default protection on individual loans and covers a stated percentage of the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest, and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure. In lieu of paying the stated coverage percentage, the Company may pay the entire claim amount, take title to the mortgaged property, and subsequently sell the property to mitigate its loss. Pool insurance, which is written on a group of loans in negotiated transactions, provides coverage that ranges up to 100% of the net loss on each individual loan included in the pool, subject to provisions regarding deductibles, caps on individual exposures, and aggregate stop loss provisions which limit aggregate losses to a specified percentage of the total original balances of all loans in the pool.
Traditional primary insurance was issued on an individual loan basis to mortgage bankers, brokers, commercial banks and savings institutions through a network of Company-managed underwriting sites located throughout the country. Traditional primary loans were individually reviewed (except for loans insured under delegated underwriting programs) and priced according to filed premium rates. In underwriting traditional primary business, the Company generally adhered to the underwriting guidelines published by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac both of which were purchasers of many of the loans the Company insured. Delegated underwriting programs allowed approved lenders to commit the Company to insure loans provided they adhered to predetermined underwriting guidelines. 
Bulk and other insurance was issued on groups of loans to mortgage banking customers through a centralized risk assessment and underwriting department. These groups of loans were priced in the aggregate on a bid or negotiated 
5

basis. Coverage for insurance issued in this manner was provided through primary insurance policies (loan level coverage) or pool insurance policies (aggregate coverage). The Company considers transactions designated as bulk insurance to be exposed to higher risk (as determined by such characteristics as origination channel, loan amount, credit quality, and extent of loan documentation) than those designated as other insurance.
Before insuring any loans, the Company issued to each approved customer a master policy outlining the terms and conditions under which coverage would be provided. Primary business was then produced via the issuance of a commitment/certificate for each loan submitted and approved for insurance. In the case of business providing pool coverage, a separate pool insurance policy was issued covering the particular loans applicable to each transaction.
As to all types of mortgage insurance products, the amount of premium charge depended on various underwriting criteria such as loan-to-value ratios, the level of coverage being provided, the borrower's credit history, the type of loan instrument (whether fixed rate/fixed payment or an adjustable rate/adjustable payment), documentation type, and whether or not the insured property is categorized as an investment or owner occupied property. Coverage is non-cancelable by the Company (except in the case of non-payment of premium or certain master policy violations) and premiums are paid under single, annual, or monthly payment plans. Single premiums are paid at the inception of coverage and provide coverage for the entire policy term. Annual and monthly premiums are renewable on their anniversary dates with the premium charge determined on the basis of the original or outstanding loan amount. The majority of the Company's direct premiums were written under monthly premium plans. Premiums may be paid by borrowers as part of their monthly mortgage payment and passed through to the Company by the servicer of the loan, or paid directly by the originator of, or investor in the mortgage loan.
During 2011, the Company's flagship mortgage guaranty insurance carrier, Republic Mortgage Insurance Company ("RMIC") and its sister company Republic Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation ("RMGIC"), discontinued writing new business in all states and limited themselves to servicing the run-off of their existing business. RMIC has continually evaluated the potential long-term underwriting performance of the run-off book of business based on various modeling techniques. The resulting models take into account actual premium and paid claim experience of prior periods, together with a large number of assumptions and judgments about future outcomes that are highly sensitive to a wide range of estimates. Many of these estimates and underlying assumptions relate to matters over which the Company has no control, including: 1) The conflicted interests, as well as the varying mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices of a large number of insured lending institutions; 2) General economic and industry-specific trends and events; and 3) The evolving or future social and economic policies of the U.S. Government vis-à-vis such critical sectors as the banking, mortgage lending, and housing industries, as well as its policies for resolving the insolvencies and assigning a possible future role to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These matters notwithstanding, RMIC's standard model of forecasted results extending through 2022 continues to reflect ultimate profitability for the book of business. In this regard a long-used RMIC standard model indicates that underwriting performance of the book of business should be positive over the run-off period assumed to end on or about December 31, 2022, though there is no guaranty of such an outcome.
 As of December 31, 2018, RFIG's mortgage insurance subsidiaries had total statutory capital, inclusive of a contingency reserve of $433.1 million, of $515.0 million. 
CCI policies, which have been issued by the Company since 1954, provide limited indemnity coverage to lenders and other financial intermediaries. The coverage is for the risk of non-payment of loan balances by individual buyers and borrowers. Claim costs are typically affected by unemployment, bankruptcy, and other issues leading to failures to pay. During 2008, the Company ceased the underwriting of new policies and the existing book of business was placed in run-off operating mode. Until year end 2017, CCI underwriting performance was affected negatively by significant litigation costs pertaining to claims settled or otherwise fully provided for through that date.

Corporate and Other Operations

Corporate and other operations include the accounts of a small life and accident insurance business as well as those of the parent holding company and its internal corporate services subsidiaries that perform cash and investment management, payroll, administrative and marketing services. The life and accident business registered net premium revenues of $14.6 million, $18.8 million, and $20.1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Life and accident business is conducted in both the United States and Canada and consists mostly of limited product offerings sold through financial intermediaries such as automobile dealers, travel agents, and marketing channels that are also utilized in some of Old Republic's general insurance operations. Production of term life insurance, accounting for net premiums earned of $6.8 million, $7.1 million, and $10.3 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was terminated and placed in run off as of year-end 2004.

Net Premiums Earned
With few exceptions, General insurance 2018 earned premiums grew for most types of coverages and markets served. The cumulative effects of recent years’ and ongoing premium rate increases for several insurance products, along with new business production were main contributors to premium growth. The greater premium levels stemmed primarily from commercial automobile (trucking), national accounts, executive indemnity and auto warranties. Positive earned premium trends throughout 2017 were unevenly distributed among various insurance coverages and sources of business. Gains were registered most prominently in commercial automobile (trucking), risk management and national accounts, and home and auto warranty. On the other hand, premium growth was constrained by low volume in a large account contractors book of business faced with a particularly competitive market place, and by reduced opportunities in gas and oil energy services and several smaller industry sectors. Premium volume from the new underwriting facility established in early 2015 also added measurably to earned premiums in all three years.
Growth in Title insurance 2018 premiums and fees reflect a slowdown in housing and mortgage lending activity during the year. The continuation of a generally positive mortgage rate environment and reasonably strong housing and commercial property markets were major factors in the year-over-year gain in premiums and fees in 2017.
RFIG Run-off earned premium volume has reflected a continuing decline due to the natural outcome of a run-off book of business devoid of new premium production since at least 2011. 
Claim Ratios
Variations in claim ratios are typically caused by changes in the frequency and severity of claims incurred, changes in premium rates and the level of premium refunds, and periodic changes in claim and claim expense reserve estimates resulting from ongoing reevaluations of reported and incurred but not reported claims and claim expenses. As demonstrated in the table on the previous page, the Company can therefore experience period-to-period volatility in the underwriting results posted for individual coverages. In light of Old Republic's basic underwriting focus in managing its business, a long-term objective has been to dampen this volatility by diversifying coverages offered and industries served. 
The claim ratios include loss adjustment expenses where appropriate. Policyholders' dividends, which apply principally to workers' compensation insurance, are a reflection of changes in loss experience for individual or groups of policies, rather than overall results, and should be viewed in conjunction with claim ratio trends.
The general insurance claim ratios are summarized as follows:
8


 | | | | Effect of Prior Periods' | | 
 | | | | (Favorable)/ | Claim Ratio Excluding
 | Reported | | Unfavorable Claim | Prior Periods' Claim 
 | Claim Ratio | | Reserves Development | Reserves Development 
2014 | | 77.9 | % | | 3.9 | % | 74.0 | %
2015 | | 74.1 | | | 1.5 | | 72.6 | 
2016 | | 73.0 | | | 0.3 | | 72.7 | 
2017 | | 71.8 | | | 0.7 | | 71.1 | 
2018 | | 72.2 | % | | — | % | 72.2 | %

The Company generally underwrites concurrently workers' compensation, commercial automobile (liability and physical damage), and general liability insurance coverages for a large number of customers. Given this concurrent underwriting approach, an evaluation of trends in premiums, claim and dividend ratios for these individual coverages is more appropriately considered for the aggregate of these coverages. As the table above indicates, claim ratios have been on a fairly consistent downtrend during the past five years. The improvement has arisen from slightly lower estimates of current accident years' claim provisions, and by the lessening impacts from developments of prior years' reserve estimates. The claim ratio increase in 2018 resulted from recurring fiscal twelve month reserve evaluations of current and prior years' developing claim experience. Substantially all of this increase stemmed from the past decade's new books of business that are subject to ongoing adjustments to the underwriting and claim management processes. The claim ratio improved in 2017 compared to 2016. While current accident year claim ratios reflected moderate year-over-year declines, these were affected by moderately unfavorable developments of prior years’ reserves. The unfavorable developments were concentrated in the Company’s largest insurance coverages of workers’ compensation and general liability which were partially offset by favorable development trends in commercial automobile (trucking). 
Claims are a major cost factor and changes in them reflect continually evolving pricing and risk selection together with variability in loss severity and frequency trends caused by fortuitous and other events. Changes in commercial automobile claim ratios are primarily due to fluctuations in claim severity. Claim ratios for workers' compensation and liability insurance can reflect greater variability due to chance events in any one year, changes in loss costs emanating from participation in involuntary markets (i.e. insurance assigned risk pools and associations in which participation is basically mandatory), and added provisions for loss costs not recoverable from assuming reinsurers which may experience financial difficulties from time to time. Additionally, workers' compensation claim costs in particular are affected by a variety of underwriting techniques such as the use of captive reinsurance retentions, retrospective premium plans, and self-insured or deductible insurance programs that are intended to mitigate claim costs over time. Claim ratios for a relatively small book of general liability coverages tend to be highly volatile year to year due to the impact of changes in claim emergence and severity of legacy asbestos and environmental claims exposures.
Title insurance claim ratios have remained in the single digits for a number of years due to a continuation of favorable trends in claims frequency and severity. 2018's claim costs trended higher as favorable development of prior years’ claim reserve estimates edged down. 2017 claim costs were lower in the face of declining claims activity since the Great Recession years. Favorable developments of reserves established in prior years further reduced the claim ratios for the periods shown in the following table: 

 | | | | Effect of Prior Periods' | | 
 | | | | (Favorable)/ | Claim Ratio Excluding
 | Reported | | Unfavorable Claim | Prior Periods' Claim 
 | Claim Ratio | | Reserves Development | Reserves Development 
2014 | | 5.2 | % | | (0.8 | )% | 6.0 | %
2015 | | 4.9 | | | (0.6 | ) | 5.5 | 
2016 | | 3.8 | | | (1.1 | ) | 4.9 | 
2017 | | 0.9 | | | (3.3 | ) | 4.2 | 
2018 | | 2.1 | % | | (2.0 | )% | 4.1 | %

The ratio of RFIG Run-off - mortgage guaranty incurred claim costs to earned premiums were reduced by 27.0, 38.3 and 39.8 percentage points for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In each instance, the reductions reflect favorable developments of prior years’ claim reserves. MI claim costs for 2017, however, had risen most significantly due to third quarter additional claim provisions of $23.0 which added 20.9 percentage points to the claim ratio for the year.
The much more favorable RFIG Run-off - CCI claim ratio for 2018 reflects the absence of the litigation-induced claim costs and favorable development of previously established claim reserves. The 2017 year-over-year claim ratio comparison was most significantly affected by the additional $107.0 million claim and related expense provisions related to the final settlement and probable dispositions of all known litigated and other claim costs. 
The consolidated claim, expense, and composite ratios reflect all the above factors and the changing period-to-period contributions of each segment to consolidated results.

General Insurance Claim Reserves
The Company's property and liability insurance subsidiaries establish claim reserves which consist of estimates to settle: a) reported claims; b) claims which have been incurred as of each balance sheet date but have not as yet been reported ("IBNR") to the insurance subsidiaries; and c) the direct costs, (fees and costs which are allocable to individual claims) and indirect costs (such as salaries and rent applicable to the overall management of claim departments) to administer known and IBNR claims. Such claim reserves, except as to classification in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as to gross and reinsured portions and purchase accounting adjustments, are reported for financial and regulatory reporting purposes at amounts that are substantially the same.
The establishment of claim reserves by the Company's insurance subsidiaries is a reasonably complex and dynamic process influenced by a large variety of factors. These factors principally include past experience applicable to the anticipated costs of various types of claims, continually evolving and changing legal theories emanating from the judicial system, recurring accounting, statistical, and actuarial studies, the professional experience and expertise of the Company's claim departments' personnel or attorneys and independent claim adjusters, ongoing changes in claim frequency or severity patterns such as those caused by natural disasters, illnesses, accidents, work-related injuries, and changes in general and industry-specific economic conditions. Consequently, the reserves established are a reflection of the opinions of a large number of persons, of the application and interpretation of historical precedent and trends, of expectations as to future developments, and of management's judgment in interpreting all such factors. At any point in time, the Company is exposed to the incurrence of possibly higher or lower than anticipated claim costs due to all of these factors, and to the evolution, interpretation, and expansion of tort law, as well as the effects of unexpected jury verdicts. 
In establishing claim reserves, the possible increase in future loss settlement costs caused by inflation is considered implicitly, along with the many other factors cited above. Reserves are generally set to provide for the ultimate cost of all claims. With regard to workers' compensation reserves, however, the ultimate cost of long-term disability or pension type claims is discounted to present value based on interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 4.0%. Where applicable, the Company only uses such discounted reserves in evaluating the results of its operations, in pricing its products and settling retrospective and reinsured accounts, in evaluating policy terms and experience, and for other general business purposes. Solely to comply with reporting rules mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, however, Old Republic has made statistical studies of applicable workers' compensation reserves to obtain estimates of the amounts by which claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance, have been discounted. These studies have resulted in estimates of such amounts at $216.5 million, $240.7 million and $231.9 million, as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. It should be noted, however, that these differences between discounted and non-discounted (terminal) reserves are fundamentally of an informational nature, and are not indicative of an effect on operating results for any one or series of years for the above noted reasons.
Early in 2001, the Federal Department of Labor revised the Federal Black Lung Program regulations. The revisions basically require a reevaluation of previously settled, denied, or new occupational disease claims in the context of newly devised, more lenient standards when such claims are resubmitted. Following a number of challenges and appeals by the insurance and coal mining industries, the revised regulations were, for the most part, upheld in June, 2002 and are to be applied prospectively. Since the final quarter of 2001, black lung claims filed or refiled pursuant to these revised regulations have increased, though the volume of new claim reports has abated in recent years.
In March 2010, federal regulations were revised once again as part of the Patient Protection and Affordability Act that reinstates two provisions that can potentially benefit claimants. In response to this most recent legislation and the above noted 2001 change, black lung claims filed or refiled have risen once again. The vast majority of claims filed to date against Old Republic pertain to business underwritten through loss sensitive programs that permit the charge of additional or refund of return premiums to wholly or partially offset changes in estimated claim costs, or to business underwritten as a service carrier on behalf of various industry-wide involuntary market (i.e. assigned risk) pools. A much smaller portion pertains to business produced on a traditional risk transfer basis. The Company has established applicable reserves for claims as they have been reported and for claims not as yet reported on the basis of its historical experience as well as assumptions relative to the effect of the revised regulations.
Old Republic's reserve estimates also include provisions for indemnity and settlement costs for various asbestosis and environmental impairment ("A&E") claims that have been filed in the normal course of business against a number of its insurance subsidiaries. Many such claims relate to policies incepting prior to 1985, including many issued during a short period between 1981 and 1982 pursuant to an agency agreement canceled in 1982. Over the years, the Company's property and liability insurance subsidiaries have typically issued general liability insurance policies with face amounts ranging between $1.0 million and $2.0 million and rarely exceeding $10.0 million. Such policies have, in turn, been subject to reinsurance cessions which have typically reduced the subsidiaries' net retentions to $.5 million or less as to each claim.
Old Republic's exposure to A&E claims cannot be calculated by conventional insurance reserving methods for a variety of reasons, including: a) the absence of statistically valid data inasmuch as such claims typically involve long reporting delays and very often uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds against whom such claims have arisen or will arise; and b) the litigation history of such or similar claims for insurance industry members which has produced inconsistent court decisions with regard to such questions as to when an alleged loss occurred, which policies provide coverage, how a loss is to be allocated among potentially responsible insureds and/or their insurance carriers, how policy coverage exclusions are to be interpreted, what types of environmental impairment or toxic tort claims are covered, when the insurer's duty to defend is triggered, how policy limits are to be calculated, and whether clean-up costs constitute property damage. 
10

Over time, the Executive Branch and/or the Congress of the United States have proposed or considered changes in the legislation and rules affecting the determination of liability for environmental and asbestosis claims. As of December 31, 2018, however, there is no solid evidence to suggest that possible future changes might mitigate or reduce some or all of these claim exposures. Because of the above issues and uncertainties, estimation of reserves for losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for A&E claims in particular is much more difficult or impossible to quantify with a high degree of precision. Accordingly, no representation can be made that the Company's reserves for such claims and related costs will not prove to be overstated or understated in the future. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, Old Republic's aggregate indemnity and loss adjustment expense reserves specifically identified with A&E exposures amounted to approximately $105.8 million and $117.4 million gross, respectively, and $74.4 million and $96.4 million net of reinsurance, respectively. Based on average annual claims payments during the five most recent calendar years, such reserves represented a paid loss survival ratio of 4.3 years (gross) and 5.0 years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2018 and 4.6 years (gross) and 6.3 years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2017. Fluctuations in this ratio between years can be caused by the inconsistent pay out patterns associated with these types of claims. For the five years ended December 31, 2018, incurred A&E claim and related loss settlement costs have averaged .2% of average annual General Insurance Group claims and related settlement costs.

Over the years, the subject of property and liability insurance claim reserves has been written about and analyzed extensively by a large number of professionals and regulators. Accordingly, the above discussion should be regarded as a basic outline of the subject and not as a definitive presentation. The Company believes that its overall reserving practices have been consistently applied over many years, and that its aggregate reserves have generally resulted in reasonable approximations of the ultimate net costs of claims incurred. However, no representation is made nor is any guaranty given that ultimate net claim and related costs will not develop in future years to be greater or lower than currently established reserve estimates.
(b) Investments. In common with other insurance organizations, Old Republic invests most of its capital and operating funds in income producing securities. Investments must comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations which prescribe the nature, form, quality, and relative amounts of investments which may be made by insurance companies. Generally, these laws and regulations permit insurance companies to invest within varying limitations in state, municipal and federal government obligations, corporate debt, preferred and common stocks, certain types of real estate, and first mortgage loans. For many years, Old Republic's investment policy has therefore been to acquire and retain primarily investment grade, publicly traded, fixed maturity securities, and in more recent years, a greater amount of high yielding publicly traded large capitalization equity securities. The investment policy is also influenced by the terms of the insurance coverages written, by its expectations as to the timing of claim and benefit payments, and by income tax considerations. As a consequence of all these factors, the Company's invested assets portfolio is directed in consideration of enterprise-wide risk management objectives. Most importantly, these are intended to ensure solid funding of insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to policyholders and other beneficiaries, as well as the long-term stability of the subsidiaries' capital accounts. To this end, the investment portfolio contains no significant insurance risk-correlated asset exposures to real estate, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations ("CDO's"), derivatives, hybrid securities, or illiquid private equity and hedge fund investments. Moreover, the Company does not engage in hedging or securities lending transactions, nor does it invest in securities whose values are predicated on non-regulated financial instruments exhibiting amorphous or unfunded counter-party risk attributes.
Management considers investment grade fixed maturity securities to be those rated by major credit rating agencies that fall within the top four rating categories, or securities which are not rated but have characteristics similar to securities so rated. The Company had no fixed maturity investments in default as to principal and/or interest at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The status and fair value changes of each of the fixed maturity investments are reviewed at least once per quarter during the year, and estimates of other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI") in the portfolio's value are evaluated and established at each quarterly balance sheet date. 
The realization of investment gains or losses can be highly discretionary and can be affected by such randomly occurring factors as the timing of individual securities sales, the recording of estimated losses from write-downs of impaired securities, tax-planning and tax-rate change considerations, and modifications of investment management judgments regarding the direction of securities markets or the future prospects of individual investees or industry sectors.

(c) Marketing. Commercial automobile (trucking), workers' compensation and general liability insurance underwritten for business enterprises and public entities is marketed primarily through independent insurance agents and brokers with the assistance of Old Republic's trained sales, underwriting, actuarial, and loss control personnel. The remaining property and liability commercial insurance written by Old Republic is obtained through insurance agents or brokers who are independent contractors and generally represent other insurance companies, and by direct sales. No single source accounted for over 10% of Old Republic's premium volume in 2018.
A substantial portion of the Company's title insurance business is referred to it by title insurance agents, builders, lending institutions, real estate developers, realtors, and lawyers. Title insurance and related real estate settlement products are sold through 274 Company offices and through agencies and underwritten title companies in the District of Columbia and all 50 states. The issuing agents are authorized to issue commitments and title insurance policies based on their own search and examination, or on the basis of abstracts and opinions of approved attorneys. Policies are also issued through independent title companies (not themselves title insurers) pursuant to underwriting agreements. These agreements generally provide that the agency or underwritten company may cause title policies of the Company to be issued, and the latter is responsible under such policies for any payments to the insured. Typically, the agency or underwritten title company deducts the major portion of the title insurance charge to the customer as its commission for services. During 2018, approximately 74% of title insurance premiums and fees were accounted for by policies issued by agents and underwritten title companies.
Title insurance premium and fee revenue is closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market. The volume of real estate activity is affected by the availability and cost of financing, population growth, family movements and other socio-economic factors. Also, the title insurance business is seasonal. During the winter months, new building activity is reduced and, accordingly, the Company produces less title insurance business relative to new construction during such months than during the rest of the year. The most important factors, insofar as Old Republic's title business is concerned, however, are the rates of activity in the resale and refinance markets for residential properties.
The Company's flagship mortgage guaranty insurance carrier ceased underwriting new policies and the existing book of business was placed in run-off operating mode effective August 31, 2011. Prior to that date, traditional primary mortgage insurance was marketed principally through a direct sales force which called on mortgage bankers, brokers, commercial banks, savings institutions and other mortgage originators. No sales commissions or other forms of remuneration were paid to the lending institutions or others for the procurement or development of business.
The personal contacts, relationships, reputations, and intellectual capital of Old Republic's key executives and other associates responsible for the production of business are a vital element in obtaining and retaining much of its business. Many of the Company's customers produce large amounts of premiums and fees and therefore warrant substantial levels 
13

of attention and involvement by these persons. In this respect, Old Republic's mode of operation is similar to that of professional reinsurers and commercial insurance brokers, and relies on the marketing, underwriting, and management skills of relatively few key people for large parts of its business.
Historically, several types of insurance coverages underwritten by Old Republic, such as consumer credit indemnity, title, and mortgage guaranty insurance, have been affected in varying degrees by changes in national economic conditions. During periods when housing activity or mortgage lending are constrained by any combination of rising interest rates, tighter mortgage underwriting guidelines, falling home prices, excess housing supply and/or economic recession, operating and/or claim costs pertaining to such coverages tend to rise disproportionately to revenues and can result in underwriting losses and reduced levels of profitability.
At least one Old Republic general insurance subsidiary is licensed to do business in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and each of the Canadian provinces. Title insurance operations are licensed to do business in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. Although not currently writing new business, the mortgage insurance subsidiaries are licensed in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Consolidated direct premium volume distributed among the various geographical regions shown was as follows for the past three years:

 | | Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | %

(d) Reserves, Reinsurance, and Retrospective Adjustments. Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries establish reserves for unearned premiums, reported claims, IBNR claims, and claim adjustment expenses, as required in the circumstances. See "General Insurance Claim Reserves" herein.
In order to maintain premium production within its capacity and limit maximum losses for which it might become liable under its policies, Old Republic, as is the common practice in the insurance industry, may cede all or a portion of its premiums and related liabilities on certain classes of insurance, individual policies, or blocks of business to other insurers and reinsurers. Although the ceding of insurance does not ordinarily discharge an insurer from its direct liability to a policyholder, it is industry practice to establish the reinsured part of risks as the liability of the reinsurer. Old Republic also employs retrospective premium and a large variety of risk-sharing procedures and arrangements for parts of its business in order to reduce underwriting losses for which it might become liable under insurance policies it issues, and to afford its customers or producers a degree of participation in the risks and rewards associated with such business. Under retrospective arrangements, Old Republic collects additional premiums if losses are greater than originally anticipated and refunds a portion of original premiums if loss costs are lower. Pursuant to risk sharing arrangements, the Company adjusts production costs or premiums retroactively to likewise reflect deviations from originally expected loss costs. The amount of premium, production costs and other retrospective adjustments which may be made is either limited or unlimited depending on the Company's evaluation of risks and related contractual arrangements.
The following table displays the Company's General Insurance liabilities reinsured by its ten largest reinsurers as of December 31, 2018.

Reinsured liabilities of the Title Insurance Group, RFIG Run-off Group and small life and accident insurance operations are not material.
Reinsurance recoverable asset balances represent amounts due from or credited by assuming reinsurers for paid and unpaid claims and policy reserves. Such reinsurance balances that are recoverable from non-admitted foreign and certain other reinsurers such as captive insurance companies owned by assureds or business producers, as well as similar balances or credits arising from policies that are retrospectively rated or subject to assureds' high deductible retentions are substantially collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit, securities, and other financial instruments. Old Republic evaluates on a regular basis the financial condition of its assuming reinsurers and assureds who purchase its retrospectively rated or high deductible policies. Estimates of unrecoverable amounts are included in the Company's net claim and claim expense reserves since reinsurance, retrospectively rated and self-insured deductible policies and contracts do not relieve Old Republic from its direct obligations to assureds or their beneficiaries.
Old Republic's reinsurance practices with respect to portions of its business also result from its desire to bring its sponsoring organizations and customers into some degree of joint venture or risk sharing relationship. The Company may, in exchange for a ceding commission, reinsure up to 100% of the underwriting risk, and the premium applicable to such risk, to insurers owned by or affiliated with lending institutions, financial and other intermediaries, and commercial institutions generally whose customers are insured by Old Republic, or individual customers who have formed captive insurance companies. The ceding commissions received compensate Old Republic for performing the direct insurer's functions of underwriting, actuarial, claim settlement, loss control, legal, reinsurance, and administrative services to comply with local and federal regulations, and for providing appropriate risk management services.
Remaining portions of Old Republic's business are reinsured in most instances with independent insurance or reinsurance companies pursuant to excess of loss agreements. Except as noted in the following paragraph, reinsurance protection on property and liability coverages generally limits the net loss on most individual claims to a maximum of: $5.2 million for workers' compensation; $6.4 million for commercial automobile (trucking) liability; $6.4 million for general liability; $12.0 million for executive protection (directors & officers and errors & omissions); $2.0 million for aviation; and $5.0 million for property coverages. Title insurance risk assumptions are generally limited to a maximum of $500.0 million as to any one policy. The vast majority of title policies issued, however, carry exposures of less than $1.0 million. The average direct primary mortgage guaranty exposure is (in whole dollars) $37,700 per insured loan. 
 Since January 1, 2005, the Company has had maximum treaty reinsurance coverage of up to $200.0 million for its workers' compensation exposures. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, however, all workers' compensation primary insurers such as the Company remain liable for unlimited amounts in excess of reinsured limits. Other than the substantial concentration of workers' compensation losses caused by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, to the best of the Company's knowledge there had not been a similar accumulation of claims in a single location from a single occurrence prior to that event. Nevertheless, the possibility continues to exist that non-reinsured losses could, depending on a wide range of severity and frequency assumptions, aggregate several hundred million dollars to an insurer such as the Company. Such aggregation of losses could occur in the event of a catastrophe such as an earthquake that could lead to the death or injury of a large number of persons concentrated in a single facility such as a high rise building. 
As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, the reinsurance industry eliminated coverage from substantially all contracts for claims arising from acts of terrorism. Primary insurers like the Company thus became fully exposed to such claims. Late in 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "TRIA") was signed into law, immediately establishing a temporary federal reinsurance program administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. The program applied to insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from an act of terrorism, as defined in the TRIA. Congress extended and modified the program in late 2005 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act of 2005 (the "TRIREA"). TRIREA expired on December 31, 2007. Congress enacted a revised program 
15

in December 2007 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (the "TRIPRA") of 2007, a seven year extension that expired in December 2014. In January 2015, Congress passed the TRIPRA of 2015 that extended the program through 2020.
The TRIA automatically voided all policy exclusions which were in effect for terrorism related losses and obligated insurers to offer terrorism coverage with most commercial property and casualty insurance lines. The TRIREA revised the definition of "property and casualty insurance" to exclude commercial automobile, burglary and theft, surety, professional liability and farm owners multi-peril insurance. TRIPRA did not make any further changes to the definition of property and casualty insurance, however, it did include domestic acts of terrorism within the scope of the program. Although insurers are permitted to charge an additional premium for terrorism coverage, insureds may reject the coverage. Under TRIPRA, the program's protection is not triggered for losses arising from an act of terrorism until the industry first suffers losses in excess of a prescribed aggregate deductible during any one year. The program deductible trigger is $180 million and $200 million for 2019 and 2020, respectively. Once the program trigger is met, the program will be responsible for a fixed percentage of the Company's terrorism losses that exceed its deductible which ranges from 85% for 2015 and declines by one percentage point per year until it reaches 80% in 2020. The Company's deductible amounts to 20% of direct earned premium on eligible property and casualty insurance coverages. The Company currently reinsures limits on a treaty basis of $195.0 million in excess of $5.0 million for claims arising from certain acts of terrorism for casualty clash and catastrophe workers' compensation liability insurance coverages. The Company also purchases facultative reinsurance on certain accounts in excess of $200.0 million to manage the Company's net exposures.

(e) Competition. The insurance business is highly competitive and Old Republic competes with many stockholder-owned and mutual insurance companies. Many of these competitors offer more insurance coverages and have substantially greater financial resources than the Company. The rates charged for many of the insurance coverages in which the Company specializes, such as workers' compensation insurance, other property and liability insurance and title insurance, are primarily regulated by the states. The basic methods of competition available to Old Republic, aside from rates, are service to customers, expertise in tailoring insurance programs to the specific needs of its clients, efficiency and flexibility of operations, personal involvement by its key executives, and, as to title insurance, accuracy and timely delivery of evidences of title issued.
The Company believes its experience and expertise have enabled it to develop a variety of specialized insurance programs and related services for its customers, and to secure state insurance departments' approval of these programs.
(f) Government Regulation. In common with all insurance companies, Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries are subject to the regulation and supervision of the jurisdictions in which they do business. The method of such regulation varies, but, generally, regulation has been delegated to state insurance commissioners who are granted broad administrative powers relating to: the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; approval of policy forms; reserve requirements; and trade practices. In addition to these types of regulation, many classes of insurance, including most of the Company's insurance coverages, are subject to rate regulations which require that rates be reasonable, adequate, and not unfairly discriminatory.
The majority of states have also enacted insurance holding company laws which require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies controlled by other corporations licensed to transact business within their respective jurisdictions. Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries are subject to such legislation and are registered as controlled insurers in those jurisdictions in which such registration is required. Such legislation varies from state to state but typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurers, or ultimate holding company, and all subsidiaries of the ultimate holding company, and prior approval of certain intercorporate transfers of assets (including payments of dividends in excess of specified amounts by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. Each state has established minimum capital and surplus requirements to conduct an insurance business. At December 31, 2018 each of the Company’s General, Title, Mortgage Guaranty and Life and Accident insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements.
Data Protection and Cybersecurity
The Company is subject to U.S. laws and regulations that require financial institutions, insurance companies and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information and provide notice of their practices relating to the collection and disclosure of personal information. The Company is also subject to laws and regulations requiring notification to affected individuals and regulators of security breaches.
Effective March 1, 2017, the New York Department of Financial Services issued a landmark cybersecurity regulation requiring covered financial services institutions to implement a cybersecurity program designed to protect customer information as well as information technology systems. The regulation imposes specific safeguards as well as governance, risk assessment, monitoring and testing, third party service provider incident response and reporting and other requirements.
In October 2017, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law, which requires insurers, insurance producers and other entities licensed under state insurance laws to develop and maintain a written information security program, conduct risk assessments, oversee the data security practices of third-party service providers and other related requirements. Since the model law’s adoption, numerous states in which the Company operates have approved legislation incorporating the model into statute.

In June 2018, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act. This law provides California residents with broad personal data protections and rights related to the use and collection of their personal information. The Company anticipates additional information security and privacy laws and regulations to be forthcoming.
(g) Employees. As of December 31, 2018, Old Republic and its subsidiaries employed approximately 9,000 persons on a full time basis. Approximately 50% of this total was represented by employees associated with the Company's title insurance segment. A majority of eligible full time employees participate in various pension plans (all of which are frozen) or other plans which provide benefits payable upon retirement. Eligible employees are also covered by hospitalization and major medical insurance, group life insurance, and various savings, profit sharing, and deferred compensation plans. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
(h) Website access. The Company files various reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company's reports are available by visiting the SEC's internet website (http://www.sec.gov) and accessing its EDGAR database to view or print copies of the electronic versions of the Company's reports. Additionally, the Company's reports can be obtained, free of charge, by visiting its internet website (http://www.oldrepublic.com), selecting Investors then SEC Filings to view or print copies of the electronic versions of the Company's reports.
