History 
The Company was incorporated in Nevada on March 20, 2014 under the name Medicine Man Technologies, Inc., and it rebranded its name to Schwazze in April 2020. The Company’s operations began through the licensing of proprietary processes developed, implemented, and practiced at other cannabis facilities relating to the commercial growth, cultivation, marketing and distribution of medical and recreational marijuana pursuant to relevant state laws. The Company continued early expansion with the acquisition of Success Nutrients™ and Pono Publications, including the rights to the book titled “Three A Light” and the proprietary cultivation techniques documented therein, which have been part of the Company’s product and service offerings since the acquisition. The Company then entered into the retail market by way of its acquisition of Two J’s LLC d/b/a The Big Tomato in 2018, a leading supplier of hydroponics and indoor gardening supplies in the Denver metro area.
Prior to 2020, the Company was focused on cannabis dispensary and cultivation consulting and providing equipment and nutrients to cannabis cultivators. In 2019, the Company made a strategic decision to move toward direct plant-touching operations due to changes in Colorado law expanding permitted investments into plant-touching cannabis companies. The Company developed a plan to roll up a number of direct plant-touching dispensaries, manufacturing, and cultivation facilities with the goal of being one of the largest seed-to-sale cannabis businesses in Colorado. In April 2020, the Company acquired its first plant-touching business, Mesa Organics Ltd. d/b/a Purplebee’s (“Purplebee’s”), which consisted of four dispensaries and one manufacturing infused products facility. Following the acquisition of Purplebee’s, the Company established a substantial retail presence in Colorado with its acquisition of 13 Star Buds branded dispensaries between December 2020 and March 2021 and its acquisition of two Emerald Fields branded dispensaries in February 2022, which it has continued to build through additional acquisitions. The Company entered the New Mexico cannabis market in 2022 when it acquired ten R. Greenleaf branded dispensaries, one manufacturing facility, and four cultivation

facilities. Since its first plant-touching acquisition in April 2020, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions in an effort to expand its market presence and achieve complete vertical integration.

Greenleaf, one manufacturing facility, and four cultivation facilities under the terms of a Purchase Agreement, dated November 29, 2021, with Nuevo Holding, LLC and Nuevo Elemental Holding, LLC, both of which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company (collectively, the “Nuevo Purchasers”), Reynold Greenleaf & Associates, LLC (“RGA”), Elemental Kitchen and Laboratories, LLC (“Elemental”), the equity holders of RGA and Elemental, and William N. Ford, in his capacity as Representative, as amended on February 8, 2022 (the “Nuevo Purchase Agreement”). The Nuevo Purchasers acquired substantially all of the operating assets of RGA and all of the equity of Elemental and assumed specified liabilities of RGA and Elemental. Pursuant to existing laws and regulations in New Mexico, the cannabis licenses for certain facilities managed by RGA are held by two not-for-profit entities: Medzen Services, Inc. (“Medzen”) and R. Greenleaf Organics, Inc. (“R. Greenleaf” and together with Medzen, the “NFPs”). At the closing, Nuevo Holding, LLC gained control over the NFPs by becoming the sole member of each of the NFPs and replacing the directors of the two NFPs with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, and the Company’s General Counsel. The business acquired from RGA consists of serving as a branding, marketing and consulting company, licensing certain intellectual property related to the business of THC-based products to Elemental and the NFPs, providing consulting services to Elemental and the NFPs, and supporting Elemental and the NFPs to promote, support, and develop sales and distribution of products. Elemental is engaged in the business of creating and distributing cannabis-derived products to licensed cannabis producers. Elemental and the NFPs are in the business of cultivating, processing and dispensing marijuana in New Mexico, with 10 dispensaries, four cultivation facilities (three operating and one under development) and one manufacturing facility.

Current Operations and Developments
Operating Segments
The Company’s operations are organized into three different segments as follows: (i) Retail, consisting of retail locations for sale of cannabis products; (ii) Wholesale, consisting of manufacturing, cultivation and sale of both wholesale cannabis and non-cannabis products; and (iii) Other, consisting of all other income and expenses, which primarily includes those related to in-store advertising and general corporate operations. Each of our operating segments are discussed in further detail below.
SEGMENT 1 –Retail – This segment currently includes our Retail dispensaries located in Colorado and New Mexico.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned and operated 25 retail cannabis dispensaries in the State of Colorado—19 retail dispensaries under the banner name Star Buds and six retail dispensaries under the banner name Emerald Fields—and 16 retail cannabis dispensaries in the State of New Mexico, all under the banner name R. Greenleaf. 
Our dispensaries sell a wide variety of cannabis products directly to tens of thousands of consumers. These products include loose flower, concentrates, edibles, pre-rolls, topicals, infused beverages, and other associated cannabis products produced by a large variety of cannabis vendors. In Colorado, our retail dispensaries sell products sourced from our Wholesale segment, investment partners, licensing arrangements, and other third party suppliers. In New Mexico, our retail dispensaries sell products predominantly sourced through internal wholesale operations and a small percentage of third party products.

SEGMENT 2 – Wholesale – This segment includes consolidated Wholesale, Cultivation, and Manufacturing. 
The Company supports its retail operations and growth through the operation of wholly-owned manufacturing and cultivation facilities. The Company’s wholly-owned manufacturing and cultivation facilities also engage with the wholesale markets in Colorado and New Mexico. The Company’s wholesale business includes cannabis and non-cannabis operations, although the Company’s cannabis wholesale operations are more substantial than its non-cannabis activities.
Wholesale
The Company participates in the wholesale market through both its cultivation and manufacturing operations based on market conditions and internal needs.
The wholesale cannabis market is influenced by a number of factors outside of the Company’s control largely due to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry. The Company has acquired robust cultivation capacity such that it can expand production and sell its cultivation products to the wholesale market during certain market cycles when advantageous to do so, and it also has the ability to scale back production when the wholesale market is less profitable.
The Company’s manufacturing operations are used to extract oil from the cannabis plant and refine the oil into distillate oil.  It sells this distillate oil to other product manufacturers. Like its cultivation facilities, the Company can increase or curtail its production capacity to adjust to market conditions. 
Lastly, the Company also supplies the wholesale markets through the sale of cannabis cultivation materials, nutrients, and equipment. The Company sells a variety of indoor gardening supplies and hydroponics through its online and retail store, The Big Tomato, located in Aurora, Colorado. While these wholesale activities were a meaningful component of the Company’s operations in the past, the Company’s business strategy has trended away from these revenue sources in recent years due to growth and expansion of the Company’s retail, manufacturing, and cultivation activities as well as the impact of the greater wholesale market downturn in Colorado and nationwide. Management is assessing the ongoing value and anticipated future utilization of these particular wholesale operations. 
Cultivation 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned eight cultivation facilities: four in Colorado and four in New Mexico. The Company leverages its cultivating capacity in both states where it operates to participate in the wholesale market and/or support internal operations based on market conditions and profitability in wholesale transactions. 
The Company operated four active cultivations in Colorado throughout 2022, but it ceased operations at two of its facilities located in Denver, Colorado during the year to consolidate production activities and drive synergies. The Company maintains four active cultivation licenses in Colorado as of March 1, 2023. 
The Company’s primary cultivation facilities in Colorado include (i) a 37,000 square foot building located in Denver, Colorado leased by the Company for indoor cultivation (the “Brow Cultivation”) and (ii) 36 acres of land in Huerfano County, Colorado owned by the Company and designed for indoor and outdoor cultivation (the “SCG Cultivation”). The SCG Cultivation includes a greenhouse and 24 hoop houses, and the Company is expanding the SCG Cultivation to include additional hoop houses for increased outdoor cultivation capacity. 
The Company operated four active indoor cultivations in New Mexico during 2022, and it discontinued operations at one of its cultivation facilities located in Albuquerque, New Mexico during 2022 to consolidate production activities and drive synergies. The Company maintains three active cultivation licenses in New Mexico as of March 1, 2023. 
The Company’s primary cultivation facility in New Mexico is a 40,000 square foot building located in Albuquerque, New Mexico (the “Edith Grow”). The Company completed the first phase of planned renovation of the Edith Grow in 2022 with the goal of completing additional phases of construction and renovation to expand the cultivation capacity of the Edith Grow for increased synergies and cost savings. The Edith Grow, together with the Company’s other indoor 

6



cultivation facilities in New Mexico, primarily support Elemental’s manufacturing operations and the New Mexico Retail segment operations.
Manufacturing and Extraction
As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned and operated two manufacturing facilities: one in Colorado and one in New Mexico. 
The Company’s manufacturing facilities primarily conduct cannabis extraction, distillation, manufacturing, and infusion operations for incorporation into retail cannabis products or sale through internal and external channels. The Company purchases cannabis biomass and trim to support manufacturing operations both internally from its cultivation operations as well as from a number of different vendors across Colorado and New Mexico. The Company maintains the ability to strategically adjust the amount of materials sourced from internal and external sources based on market conditions due to vertical integration in both states. 
The Company’s Colorado manufacturing facility is owned and operated by PBS. PBS leases a facility in Pueblo, Colorado containing approximately 7,000 square feet of space where PBS conducts ethanol extraction, distillation, and manufacturing of cannabis plants and biomass for sale and distribution to external buyers and internally to support the Company’s retail segment. PBS also supports the Colorado Retail segment by processing and packaging products for retail distribution from time to time. The Company acquires cannabis biomass and trim to support PBS’s manufacturing operations both internally from its cultivation operations at SCG and the Brow Cultivation as well as from a number of different vendors across Colorado. However, manufacturing operations in Colorado source raw materials from external vendors to a greater degree than manufacturing operations in New Mexico due to pricing and market conditions. PBS produces vapes, cartridges, and syringes for internal and external distribution, which includes the Company’s proprietary brand of vape products: Purplebee’s and Autograph by Purplebee’s. 
The Company’s New Mexico manufacturing facility is owned and operated by Elemental, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Elemental leases a manufacturing facility located in Albuquerque, New Mexico representing approximately 6,000 square feet where it performs extraction, infusion, and manufacturing operations. Elemental produces a number of cannabis products that are sold in R. Greenleaf dispensaries, including edibles and vapes. Elemental primarily sources the raw materials used for its operations through the Company’s cultivation and wholesale operations due to increased vertical integration in New Mexico, although Elemental does purchase biomass and trim from external sources to support its operations. 
SEGMENT 3 – Other – This segment includes General Corporate and Other.
General Corporate and Other 
The Other segment encompasses the Company’s general corporate operations not otherwise categorized as retail or wholesale, and it also includes revenue from in-store advertisements and certain vendor promotions. This segment also includes the Company’s research and development subsidiary, Schwazze Biosciences LLC, which is committed to pursuing a program of basic and applied research focused on bringing consumers, as well as pets, the most beneficial properties of the cannabis plant. 
Marketing 
The Company markets its products, retail establishments and services to consumers through a variety of channels, including: digital marketing efforts, print advertising, outdoor billboards, coupons, a consolidated loyalty program across all states and retail banners, ecommerce websites, budtender appreciation events, universal gift card program, “search engine optimization” activities, grand opening or newly remodeled store events, brand pop-up events, and in-store promotions. In 2022, the Company’s Colorado retail banner, Star Buds, was the first cannabis sponsor of a professional ultimate frisbee sporting team, The Colorado Summit.

7



Schwazze has created and maintains a database of marketing collateral materials and resources used for the Schwazze parent company brand, its in-house products/brands, and across all retail banners in the states in which it operates. The Company also coalesces interest and a presence within the industry through participation in various industry events, building relationships with key regulatory and government affairs officials, and through direct promotion.

The Company continues to enhance its online presence via its house of brands website, http://www.schwazze.com, and its investor relations website, http://www.ir.schwazze.com. During 2022, the Company revamped its website to include an overview of its retail and wholesale brands, features on management and its Board of Directors, latest investor relations presentations, links to media, analyst coverage and press relations, Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reports, and our industry partners.
​
Intellectual Property, Brand Development, and Licensing
Our operational success and business strategy incorporates various pieces of proprietary intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, and copyrights owned by the Company and licensing of third party intellectual property pursuant to licensing agreements. We also acknowledge that certain protections normally available to us related to design or other utility patents in the cannabis industry are not currently enforceable under federal law. We attempt to protect our intellectual property via the deployment of robust non-disclosure agreements with both prospective partners, employees, and licensees prior to engagement. We also register our owned intellectual property in the states where we operate in an effort to enhance protection against infringement. There are no assurances that these non-disclosure agreements will prevent a third party from infringing upon our rights, and we also cannot enforce our owned cannabis-related intellectual property outside of the states of Colorado and New Mexico where our marks are registered. We intend to register for federal patent and trademark protection that is otherwise currently prohibited if and when the federal government eliminates the cannabis prohibition. 
Schwazze is actively building a house of brands that includes both our active retail banners as well as products for sale at both the retail and wholesale level, manufacturing all products and controlling the quality for such brands through its vertical integration. The Company has developed three internally owned product brands as of March 1, 2023. These brands include: (i) Purplebee’s and (ii) Autograph by Purplebee’s, the Company’s distillate vaporizer product line, and (iii) EDW (Every Day Weed), which is a pre-packaged pouch of loose-ground flower offered in half-ounce increments at an affordable price point. Purplebee’s, Autograph by Purplebee’s, and EDW are available for sale in Indica, Sativa and Hybrid strains. 

In addition to internal brand development efforts, we also enter into advantageous licensing agreements with other cannabis companies with recognizable brand value to maximize the success of our product offerings and sales. Schwazze has an exclusive licensing partnership with the premium California-based cannabis flower brand, Lowell Herb Company, which gives the Company exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and promote Lowell Farms products in the Colorado and New Mexico markets. Current products include: Quicks, Classics and Singles. Quicks and Classics are sold in 3.5g multi-units packs in blends of strains of indica, sativa, and hybrid dominances, while “singles” are 1g, single strain pre-rolls. The Lowell Farms brand is promoted through in-store advertising and promotion, customer loyalty programming, and budtender appreciation events. We also maintain a non-exclusive branding partnership with Mission Holdings pursuant to which we sell Mission Holdings’ proprietary brand of low-cost edibles, Nfuzed gummies, and premium flower, Level 10, in our retail channels in the states where we operate.
We also acquired a number of brands through previous acquisitions of existing dispensaries with varying degrees of brand recognition and loyalty that we actively utilize in our house of brands. In connection with the Star Buds acquisitions, we acquired the exclusive right to use the Star Buds brand in Colorado pursuant to a licensing agreement with the owners of the Star Buds intellectual property. We also acquired all of the rights in and interest to the Emerald Fields intellectual property owned by MCG that was acquired pursuant to the MGC Merger Agreement. In Colorado, we currently operate all of our retail dispensaries under the Emerald Fields or Star Buds banner. In New Mexico, we acquired the intellectual property associated with R. Greenleaf and operate all existing dispensaries under the R. Greenleaf banner.

Government Regulations
Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently involved in the cannabis industry. The Company is directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale, and distribution of cannabis in the adult-use cannabis marketplace in the State of Colorado and the State of New Mexico.
Federal Regulations
The United States federal government regulates drugs through the federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in one of five different schedules. Cannabis, except hemp containing less than .3% (on a dry weight basis) of the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I drug. As a Schedule I drug, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) considers cannabis to have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. The classification of cannabis as a Schedule I drug is inconsistent with what the Company believes to be many valuable medical uses for cannabis accepted by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. As evidence of this, the FDA on June 25, 2018 approved Epidiolex (CBD) oral solution with an active ingredient derived from the cannabis plant for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified drug substance derived from the cannabis plant. CBD is a chemical component of cannabis that does not contain the intoxication properties of THC (“THC”), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. The Company believes the CSA categorization as a Schedule I drug is not reflective of the medicinal properties of cannabis or the public perception thereof, and numerous studies show cannabis is not able to be abused in the same way as other Schedule I drugs, has medicinal properties, and can be safely administered.
The federal position is also not necessarily consistent with democratic approval of cannabis at the state government level in the United States. Unlike in Canada, which has federal legislation uniformly governing the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act, S.C. 2018, c. 16, (Canada) and the Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations, cannabis is largely regulated at the state and local level in the United States. State laws regulating cannabis conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal, and any such acts are criminal acts. Although the Company’s activities are compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to federal criminal charges that may be brought against the Company. The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution establishes that the United States Constitution and federal laws made pursuant to it are paramount and, in case of conflict between federal and state law, federal law shall apply.
Nonetheless, 44 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands have legalized some form of cannabis for medical use, while 21 states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes. As more and more states legalized medical and/or adult-use cannabis, the 
federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal prohibition under the CSA and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, with cannabis listed as a Schedule I drug under the CSA.
Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal law enforcement agencies and banking institutions regarding cannabis through a series of memoranda from the Department of Justice (“DOJ”). The most recent such memorandum was drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 (the “Cole Memorandum”). The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal enforcement agencies as to how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations, and prosecutions regarding cannabis in all states, and acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states have enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis. The Cole Memorandum also noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to
9



control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to be a priority at the federal level. The Cole Memorandum was seen by many state-legal cannabis companies as a safe harbor for their licensed operations that were conducted in full compliance with all applicable state and local regulations. However, on January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. In the absence of a uniform federal policy, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.
Following his election, President Biden appointed Merrick Garland to serve as the U.S. Attorney General. While Attorney General Garland indicated in his confirmation hearing that he did not feel that enforcement of the federal cannabis prohibition against state-licensed business would be a priority target of the DOJ resources, no formal enforcement policy has been issued to date. There is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the U.S. Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law.
As an industry best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company abides by the following standard operating policies and procedures:

1. | Ensure that its operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Ensure that its cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements);
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Implement policies and procedures to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Implement policies and procedures to ensure that funds are not distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs, or cartels;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across any state lines in general;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Ensure that its state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, is engaged in any other illegal activity or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Ensure that its products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition, the Company conducts background checks to ensure that the principals and management of its operating subsidiaries are of good character, have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or use of firearms in cultivation, manufacturing, or distribution of cannabis. The Company will also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of its cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises, including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation. 
One legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry remains in place: Congress has passed a so-called “rider” provision in the fiscal year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Acts to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. The rider is known as the "Rohrabacher-Farr" Amendment after its original lead sponsors (it is also sometimes referred to as the “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer” or “Joyce-Leahy” Amendment). In 2021, President Biden became the first president to propose a budget with the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment included. On February 18, 2022, the amendment was renewed through the signing of a stopgap spending bill, effective through March 11, 2022.

Nevertheless, for the time being, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level. The federal government of the U.S. has always reserved the right to enforce federal law regarding the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use cannabis, even if state law sanctions such sale and disbursement. If the U.S. federal government begins to enforce U.S. federal laws relating to cannabis in states where the sale and use of cannabis is currently legal, or if existing applicable state laws are repealed or curtailed, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
There is a growing consensus among cannabis businesses and numerous members of Congress that prosecutorial discretion is not law and temporary legislative riders, such as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment, are an inappropriate way to protect lawful medical cannabis businesses. Numerous bills have been introduced in Congress in recent years to decriminalize aspects of state-legal cannabis trades. The Company has observed that each year more congressmen and congresswomen sign on and co-sponsor cannabis legalization bills. In light of all this, it is anticipated that the federal government will eventually repeal the federal prohibition on cannabis and thereby leave the states to decide for themselves whether to permit regulated cannabis cultivation, production, and sale, just as states are free today to decide policies governing the distribution of alcohol or tobacco.
The most comprehensive proposal for reform of federal legislation on cannabis was introduced on July 14, 2021, by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) along with Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) when they released draft legislation titled the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (the “CAOA”). The CAOA removes cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act which would permit its decriminalization and allow the expungement of federal non-violent marijuana crimes. The CAOA would impose a federal tax on cannabis of 10% in its first year of enactment, eventually increasing to 25% in 5% increments. The taxes raised would be used to petition fund programs to benefit communities disproportionately impacted by the “War on Drugs”.
The CAOA enshrines the current state cannabis licensing regimes but introduces additional federal permitting of cannabis wholesalers. Regulatory responsibility for cannabis control would be transferred from the DEA to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”) or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (“ATF”). The publication of the CAOA by Democratic congressional leaders represents a significant milestone in the move toward federal legalization of cannabis. While the CAOA indicates that legalization may come with significant federal tax burden, federal legalization will also bring long-awaited benefits to the industry of the removal of the Section 280E tax burden, clarity as to the status of state-licensed cannabis businesses, broad access to the banking and card payment system, and increased availability, and reduced cost, of capital.
At the time of the CAOA announcement, Senator Schumer indicated the bill currently did not have sufficient support in the Congress to pass. Although he originally targeted Spring 2022 for passage of legislation based on the CAOA draft, he then shifted to introducing of a revised draft of the CAOA in the Senate in April 2022. As introduced,  the CAOA lacked clarity regarding the transition of cannabis control from the DEA to TTB and the FDA, which presents the risk that existing operators may face a period of regulatory uncertain if legislation similar to the CAOA is enacted. Such uncertainty may impede growth of, and investment in, incumbent cannabis businesses, while exposing them to increased competition from the illicit market.
Ultimately, the CAOA did not pass and there can be no assurance that similar comprehensive legislation that would de-schedule cannabis and de-criminalize will be passed in the near future or at all. If such legislation is passed, there is no guarantee that it will include provisions that preserve the current state-based cannabis programs under which the Company’s subsidiaries operate or that such legislation will be otherwise favorable to the Company and its business. 
Colorado Regulations
On November 7, 2000, Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the state constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. On November 6, 2012, Colorado voters approved Amendment 64, which amended the state constitution to establish an adult use cannabis program in Colorado and permit the commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. The commercial sale of marijuana for adult use to the general public began on January 1, 2014 at cannabis businesses licensed 

11



under the regulatory framework. As of January 1, 2020, medical and adult use marijuana are regulated together under a single statute – the Colorado Marijuana Code.
Under the Colorado Marijuana Code, the Colorado Department of Revenue is empowered to grant licenses to both adult use and medical marijuana businesses, including cultivation facilities, products manufacturers, testing facilities, transporters, researchers and developers, and (in the adult use context) accelerator cultivators, accelerator stores, and hospitality businesses.
Cannabis businesses must also comply with local licensing requirements. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana businesses.
The Company in Colorado is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Colorado.
Colorado License Requirements
An application for a marijuana business in Colorado requires submission of (1) a copy of any local license required for the marijuana business, (2) a certificate of good standing from the jurisdiction in which the business was formed, (3) the identity and address of the registered agent in Colorado, (4) organizational documents such as articles of incorporation, bylaws, articles of organization, and similar documents, (5) corporate governance documents, (6) a deed, lease, or similar document establishing the applicant’s ability to use the proposed premises, (7) a facility diagram, (8) findings of suitability with respect to the business’ owners, (8) information regarding securities listings (if the business is publicly traded), (9) financial statements, and documents related to payments of taxes. A business is required to obtain permission from its locality as part of the licensing process.
With respect to the renewal process, provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, the Company has no reason to believe it wouldn’t receive an applicable renewed licenses in the ordinary course of business.
Regulatory Requirements
The regulations establish requirements applicable to all marijuana businesses, along with specific requirements for each type of business.
All marijuana businesses in Colorado are required to (1) create and enforce limited access areas for the protection of marijuana and marijuana products, (2) maintain security alarm systems installed and maintained by a licensed alarm installation company, as well as approved locks and surveillance equipment, (3) follow all applicable laws regarding waste disposal (including cannabis-containing waste), (4) implement an inventory tracking system used for inventory tracking and recordkeeping, (5) comply with both state and local requirements as to hours of operation, (6) comply with sanitary requirements applicable to employees and production spaces, including sanitation audits, (7) comply with recordkeeping requirements, and (8) maintain and provide procedures for dealing with product recalls.
Cultivation facilities are additionally required to (1) provide and maintain copies of standard operating procedures for cultivation, harvesting, drying, curing, trimming, packaging, storing, and sampling, (2) comply with requirements related to pesticides, and (3) comply with additional sanitary and product safety requirements. Marijuana products manufacturers are required to (1) comply with labeling and dosing requirements related to standardized doses of marijuana, (2) comply with specific prohibitions regarding the shapes, colors, and similar characteristics of edible products, refrain from use of prohibited additives and ingredients, (3) maintain and provide standard operating procedures related to manufacturing of each category of products. Marijuana dispensaries are subject to additional requirements regarding (1) methods of accepting orders, (2) payments by customers, and (3) identification of customers.
The Marijuana Enforcement Division and local licensing authorities may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of licensees to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Licensees may also be subject to 

12



inspection of the licensed premises by the local fire department, building inspector, or code enforcement officer to confirm that no health or safety concerns are present.
Colorado uses METRC as the Marijuana Enforcement Division’s marijuana inventory tracking system for all medical and adult use licensees. Marijuana is required to be tracked and reported with specific data points from seed to sale through METRC for compliance purposes under Colorado marijuana laws and regulations. This tracking is conducted by using electronic tags on plants and shipments between licensees and facilities.
New Mexico
Until 2021, New Mexico’s cannabis industry was regulated under the Lynn and Erin Compassionate Use Act (the “LECUA”), which permitted and regulated the use of cannabis for qualified and registered patients with certain medical conditions. The LECUA was administrated by the New Mexico Department of Health.
On April 12, 2021, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the Cannabis Regulation Act, which became effective on June 29, 2021 (the “CRA”). The CRA decriminalized the possession, use and cultivation of cannabis for recreational or adult use and created the Cannabis Control Division (the “CCD”) as a new division of the New Mexico Regulation & Licensing Department, to administer the CRA and promulgate, by or before January 1, 2022, a single set of rules for regulation of the State’s medical and adult use cannabis industry, including licensure, sales, testing, security, advertising and labeling of cannabis products. Other than maintenance of the patient registry for medical cannabis under the LECUA, the CRA vested CCD with all authority to administrate and regulate New Mexico’s medical and adult use cannabis activities. Consequently, parties licensed pursuant to the CCD rules can sell both medical and adult use cannabis with the most substantive differences being: (i) medical cannabis is not subject to the New Mexico Cannabis Excise Tax; (ii) persons under 21 can only legally purchase cannabis products if they are a qualified medical patient; and (iii) the CCD has the authority to effectively reserve some cannabis to ensure an “adequate supply” for medical patients.
The CRA permits local jurisdictions to adopt reasonable time, place and manner rules that do not conflict with the CRA, but such rules must not completely prohibit operation of an entity licensed under the CRA or impose criminal, civil or administrative penalties on any such licensee for the use of a property licensed by the CCD. The CRA provides for the following types of licenses: courier, testing laboratory, manufacturer, producer, retailer, research laboratory, vertically integrated, producer microbusiness, integrated microbusiness and cannabis consumption area. The CRA does not create a limit on the number of licenses issued but does limit the number of plants that can be grown under each producer license and requires as a condition of licensure that each producer applicant demonstrate the legal right to enough water for its proposed operation as determined by the CCD and validated by documents from the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer.
Per the CRA’s express requirement, retail sales of adult use cannabis products in New Mexico began on April 1, 2022. In January and March of 2022, the CCD amended its rules to increase plant counts for most license types and modified the testing requirements for cannabis products. Since April 1, 2022, there have been no substantive changes in New Mexico’s regulatory framework.
The Company is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of New Mexico. Any non-compliance citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company’s licensing, business activities or operations are required by Staff Notice 51-352 to be promptly disclosed by the Company.
New Mexico Licensing Requirements
In New Mexico, licenses are renewed annually. In order to operate in New Mexico an operator is required to obtain a license from the CCD, a certificate of occupancy from the applicable local government and a certificate of fitness from the State Fire Marshall. Each year, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per guidelines published by CCD. While renewals are annual, there is no limit to the number of renewals a licensee may obtain. Assuming requisite renewal fees are paid, renewal applications are submitted in a timely manner, and the establishment has not
13



been cited for material violations, renewal applicants can anticipate approval in the ordinary course of business. However, any unexpected denials, delays or costs associated with a licensing renewal could impede planned operations and may have a material adverse effect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
A vertically integrated cannabis establishment license permits the holder to conduct one or more of the following: (i) production of cannabis, (ii) manufacturing of cannabis products, (iii) retail establishment, or (iv) courier of cannabis products. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult-use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual older than 21 years of age who does not possess a physician’s recommendation.
Holders of licenses in New Mexico are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing: security, staffing, sales, manufacturing standards, inspections, inventory, advertising and marketing, product packaging and labeling, records and reporting, and more.
Any non-compliance citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company’s licensing, business activities or operations are required by Staff Notice 51-352 to be promptly disclosed by the Company. 
Cannabis Production Requirements
A producer license permits the holder to cultivate cannabis, including planting, growing and harvesting cannabis. A licensee must submit to the CCD a premises diagram that shows the location of all entrances, exits, rooms, cultivation areas, light locations, and security camera locations, among other things. A producer must develop and implement policies and procedures that include, at a minimum, cannabis testing criteria and procedures consistent with the CRA, employee training materials, training requirements, recordkeeping protocols, transportation, testing protocols, employee policies and procedures.
Licensees must also develop a cultivation plan that details, among other things, the cultivation areas, water usage, pesticide storage areas, processing areas, packaging areas, a light diagram, if applicable, pest management and cannabis waste procedures. A producer must follow stringent health and safety requirements that cover premises, equipment and employees. The use of pesticides is permitted so long as they are used in accordance with the New Mexico Pesticide Control Act.
Manufacturing Requirements
There are four classes of manufacturing licenses:

8. | Class I: A licensee that only packages or repackages cannabis products, or labels or relabels the cannabis product container.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


9. | Class II: A licensee that conducts Class I activities and manufactures edible products or topical products using infusion processes, or other types of cannabis products other than extracts or concentrates, and does not conduct extractions.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10. | Class III: A licensee that conducts Class I and Class II activities and extracts using mechanical methods or non-volatile solvents.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


11. | Class IV: A licensee that conducts Class I, Class II and Class III activities and extracts using volatile solvents or supercritical CO2.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
A manufacturing license permits the holder to manufacture cannabis in accordance with the Class of a license held. A licensee must submit to the CCD a premises diagram that shows the location of all entrances, exits, rooms, cultivation areas, light locations, security camera locations, among other things. A manufacturer must develop and implement policies and procedures that include, at a minimum cannabis testing criteria and procedures consistent with the CRA, employee training materials, training requirements, recordkeeping protocols, transportation, testing protocols, employee policies and procedures and training documentation. The CCD sets forth requirements regarding purity and materials used and requires all extractions to be performed in a closed loop system.

14



Retail Requirements
Adult use retailed licenses permit the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any individual age 21 years of age or older or to any individual 18 years of age or older if such person possesses a valid qualified patient, primary caregiver or reciprocal participant registry card. As with all state-legal cannabis programs, only cannabis grown in New Mexico can be sold in New Mexico.
Cannabis retailers may only display cannabis goods for inspection and sale in the retail area. Such goods may be removed from their packaging and placed in containers to allow for customer inspection, so long as the containers are not readily accessible to customers without the assistance of retailer personnel. A container must be provided to the customer by the licensed retailer or its employees, who must remain with the customer at all times that the container is being inspected by the customer. Cannabis goods removed from their packaging in this way may not be sold or consumed. They must be destroyed appropriately when they are no longer being used for display. Retailers may also sell live, immature cannabis plants and seeds. A retailer may not sell more than two ounces of cannabis, sixteen grams of cannabis extract, eight hundred milligrams of edible cannabis, or six immature cannabis plants to a customer in a single purchase. 
Courier Requirements
A licensee may deliver cannabis products directly to a qualified patient who is at least 18 years of age, a primary caregiver or a reciprocal participant, or directly to a consumer who is at least 21 years of age. Payment for cannabis and cannabis products cannot be requested or received by a cannabis courier. Licensees may only deliver cannabis products to the person who is identified by the retail cannabis licensee as an intended, authorized recipient.
Licensees must obtain cannabis from a licensed retailer and the courier must be employed by the retailer or have established a delivery agreement. Licensees must also comply with any local laws restricting time of deliveries and can only be delivered to a residential address.
Reporting Requirements
New Mexico uses BioTrackTHC (“BioTrack”) as the state’s track-and-trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the distribution chain for all sate-issued annual licensees. The system allows for other third-party system integration via application programming interface. Only licensees have access to BioTrack.
Storage, Transportation and Security Requirements
To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, the CCD requires licensed businesses to do the following:


● | maintain a video surveillance system that records continuously 24 hours a day;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintain a fully operational security alarm system;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | ensure that the facility’s outdoor premises have sufficient lighting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | not dispense from its premises outside of permissible hours of operation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | store all cannabis and cannabis products in a secured, locked room or a vault;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | report to local law enforcement within 24 hours after being notified or becoming aware of the theft, diversion or loss of cannabis; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ensure the safe transport of cannabis and cannabis products between licensed facilities and maintain a delivery manifest in any vehicle transporting cannabis and cannabis products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition to CCD storage and security requirements, local jurisdictions may have additional storage and security requirements. Such requirements, to the extent they exist, may vary from one locality to another.

15



Site Visits and Inspections
The CCD and its authorized representatives have broad authority, with or without notice, to inspect licensed cannabis operations, including premises, facilities, equipment, books and records (which may be copied, and such copies retained) and cannabis products. In addition, a licensed producer must submit annual reports to the CCD on inventory, sales, revenue, and other matters. Failure to grant representatives from CCD full and immediate access to facilities, property and premises, or to cooperate with inspections and investigations, may result in disciplinary action and referral to law enforcement. Any non-compliance citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company’s licensing, business activities or operations are required by Staff Notice 51-352 to be promptly disclosed by the Company
Compliance Activities
Despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company continues to do the following towards ensuring compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum, the FinCEN Guidance, and other best industry practices:

● | The Company and its subsidiaries operate in compliance with licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company’s cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained – for example, in the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, products are sold only to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company performs due diligence on contractors or anyone provided access to secure areas of its facilities to prevent products from being distributed to minors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company works to ensure that the licensed operators have an adequate inventory tracking system and adequate procedures in place so that its compliance system can track inventory effectively. This is done so that there is no diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or across state lines in general.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company conducts background checks as required by applicable state law.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company conducts reviews of activities of the cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate, and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of its licensed premises (including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation – e.g. transfer of products between licensed premises). These reviews are completed to ensure that licensed operators do not possess or use cannabis on federal property or engage in manufacturing or cultivation of cannabis on federal lands.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company’s product packaging complies with applicable regulations and contains necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition, the Company ensures compliance with its obligations under New Mexico law and regulations by (i) engaging third-party cannabis monitoring services who provide legislative monitoring and regulatory compliance services, and (ii) periodic reviews with external counsel who audit compliance checks on the Company’s suppliers and other industry partners to ensure their ongoing compliance and ensure that the Company’s internal processes are sufficient to maintain with its obligations under New Mexico law.
Employees and Human Capital
As of March 1, 2023, the Company employed 651 full time and 93 part time employees across all reporting segments, and the Company expects its labor demand to increase as it continues to expand operations in Colorado and New Mexico and into potential new markets in the future. The Company also employs several specialty contractors to provide support for various roles in retail sales, wholesale, cultivation, and distribution operations and general corporate roles. The Company intermittently engages temporary staffing agencies to fill labor demand during peak times in the Company’s cultivation and harvest cycle. Full time employees are distributed among several departments, including retail, cultivation, 

16



manufacturing, integration and operations, construction and project management, supply chain and distribution, facilities and security, information technology, sales and marketing, human resources, finance, mergers, acquisitions and real estate, regulatory licensing and compliance, and legal. 
The Company offers company-sponsored benefits packages to all eligible full-time employees, which includes participation in a 401(k) retirement savings plan (for which full-time and part-time employees are both eligible), medical, vision, and dental plans, disability insurance, employee assistance programs, life insurance, and other voluntary benefits such as accident insurance, hospital indemnity, critical illness coverage, and pet insurance. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement. Management currently evaluates employee performance-based on financial metrics such as EBITDA, revenue, and free cash flow, along with specific individual performance goals for certain roles, to assess and reward employee performance. 
The Company is committed to attracting, developing, and retaining qualified, hard-working individuals to contribute to a diverse and successful culture. During 2022, the Company expanded its team dedicated to human capital needs for more direct engagement with its employees and the labor needs of the organization, specifically hiring a Head of Human Resources in May 2022 and further expanding its human resources function through deployment of various resources throughout the organization. The Company engages with its employees to evaluate overall satisfaction and culture through anonymous surveys and interviews, the results of which are aggregated and compiled into action plans designed to address pressure points in its workforce. The Company anticipates implementing additional policies in future periods to further its efforts to attract and retain qualified talent across the organization.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
The Company strives to be an exemplary steward for the cannabis industry in the markets in which it operates, and the Company is committed to its contribution to a more equitable and sustainable industry. 
The cannabis industry experiences a higher degree of organic diversity than is often common in other industries, and the Company seeks to capitalize on this unique characteristic to build a more diverse workforce to foster new ideas and innovation within the cannabis community. The Company seeks to hire diverse talent at every level in the organization, including management. The Company adopted a diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy in 2022 for implementation in 2023 that seeks to attract and support a diverse workforce. 
The Company believes that strong governance and processes are key to maximizing operational synergies and success while managing and minimizing risk. Management incorporates automation and organizational checks and balances in its corporate processes to manage human resources, and it maintains good communication with the Company’s board of directors. Management meets regularly with a subset of directors of the Company to discuss acquisition activity and strategy, and the Company appointed Jonathan Berger as Lead Independent Director of the Company’s board of directors to strengthen its governance position. 
The cannabis industry is dependent on certain resources such as water and electricity to succeed. The Company strives to achieve efficient and sustainable practices so as to conserve these resources. The cost of these resources, and the cost of compliance with expanding environmental regulations, could increase in the future. 
COVID-19 and Future Pandemics
In March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized coronavirus disease 2019 (together with its variants “COVID-19”) as a pandemic. COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the U.S. and other countries across the world, and the duration and severity of its effects and those of its variants are currently unknown. The Company remains committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees and customers in accordance with recommended actions of the government and health authorities as COVID-19 persists. In the future, a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or an unrelated pandemic illness may present similar or unique operational challenges faced by the Company during the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to labor shortages, supply chain disruption, travel and work restrictions, and recessionary macroeconomic conditions impacting consumer behavior.

The Company’s financial results of operations were not materially negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for the year-ended December 31, 2022. However, the uncertain nature of the spread of COVID-19 and any future pandemics may impact the Company’s business operations in future periods.

Competition
As discussed above, our business has recently expanded. In addition to operational expansions in Colorado, we also entered the New Mexico market in 2022. With expansion in existing and new markets and operational developments, our competition has also increased. As a multi-state operator (“MSO”) with vertically integrated operations, we compete with a variety of other operators for market share, including other regional MSOs, single store operators, consumer packaged goods companies, cultivators, illicit market participants, and potentially pharmaceutical companies in the future.
In the majority of states that have legalized adult-use cannabis sales, there are specific license caps that create high barriers to entry. There are not state-wide license caps prescribed by state law in Colorado and New Mexico where we currently operate; however, some local jurisdictions place caps, outright prohibition, and/or restrictions on new license issuances, which can add additional complexity and practical barriers to our expansion efforts in certain geographic areas. 
As of December 31, 2022, there were 669 recreational cannabis licenses issued in Colorado, up from 651 recreational cannabis licenses issued as of December 31, 2021, meaning approximately 18 recreational cannabis licenses were issued in 2022 (which does not account for licenses surrendered or terminated throughout the year). Our most direct competitors within Colorado include The Green Solution, Native Roots, Green Dragon, LivWell, Columbia Care Inc., Craft Concentrates, Mammoth Manufacturing, Colorado Cannabis Company, and Spherex Inc.
In New Mexico, there were 200 cannabis licenses as of December 31, 2021, which increased to 550 cannabis licenses as of December 31, 2022. Our most direct competitors within New Mexico include Ultra Health, PurLife, Pecos Valley, Assurance, Everest, and Bloom.
Outside of Colorado and New Mexico, we also view other vertically integrated MSOs as potential competitors due to our growth and future plans; these competitors include Green Thumb Industries, Inc., iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc., Acreage Holdings, Inc., and Curaleaf Holdings, Inc. Like us, these companies can realize centralized synergies to produce higher margins. 
Additionally, we compete with the illicit markets. The New Mexico market presents more competition from illicit participants as compared to the Colorado market due to the infancy of the cannabis industry in that state as well as fewer caps and restrictions on new license issuances. As the regulatory environment continues to develop in Colorado, New Mexico, and nationwide, management believes there will be a meaningful reduction of the illicit market.
Industry Analysis
Nationally, the marijuana industry has continued to expand through the passage of legislation in many states permitting medical and/or recreational use of cannabis under state law. While there certainly appears to be a trend towards acceptance of cannabis on a state-by-state basis, there are no assurances offered that this business will be able to sustain itself over time if the Federal government changes its current position related to state legalized operations.
As of March 1, 2023 at least 38 states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam have legalized marijuana for medical use. Twenty-one of those states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have legalized the adult-use of cannabis.
Sales in the Colorado market decreased in 2022 following two years of strong growth.  The Colorado market dropped 21% from $2.23 billion in gross sales during 2021 to $1.77 billion in gross sales during 2022. The New Mexico market showed strong growth in 2022 following legalization of adult-use cannabis sales starting on April 1, 2022.  According to BDSA, the leading provider of market intelligence for the cannabis industry, the New Mexico market generated approximately

$461 million in sales in 2022, up from approximately $264 in sales during 2021, representing an increase of approximately 75%.

Recent Developments 
The Company previously reported that it signed an agreement on January 25, 2023 with Cannabis Care Wellness Centers, LLC and Green Medicals Wellness Center #5, LLC (collectively referred to as “Smokey’s”) and the owners of Smokey’s, pursuant to which the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, will purchase two retail and medical marijuana stores located in Fort Collins, Colorado and Garden City, Colorado. The aggregate consideration for the Smokey’s acquisition will be up to $7.5 million, payable in cash and Common Stock. At the closing, the Company will pay the purchase price (i) in cash in the amount of $3,750,000 and (ii) in shares of the Common Stock in the amount of $3,150,000 divided by the price per share of the Common Stock as of market close on the first trading day immediately before the closing. At the closing, the Company will use a portion of the purchase price to pay off certain indebtedness and transaction expenses of Smokey’s and then pay the balance to Smokey’s. The Company will hold back from issuance additional shares of Common Stock in the amount of $600,000 divided by the price per share of the Common Stock as of market close on the first trading day immediately before the closing and $150,000 of the cash portion of the purchase price as collateral for potential claims for indemnification from Smokey’s under the purchase agreement. Any portion of the indemnity holdback not used to satisfy indemnification claims will be issued or released (as applicable) to the owners of Smokey’s on the 18-month anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition in accordance with the purchase agreement. The cash portion of the indemnity holdback is also subject to post-closing reduction if any of the actual marijuana inventory or cash at closing is less than certain targets stated in the purchase agreement.

The closing of the Smokey’s acquisition is subject to closing conditions customary for a transaction of this nature, including, without limitation, obtaining licensing approval from the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division and local regulatory authorities.
