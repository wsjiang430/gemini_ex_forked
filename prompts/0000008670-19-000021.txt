ADP’s Strategy
Our Strategic Pillars. Our business strategy is based on three strategic pillars, which are designed to position us as the global market leader in HCM technology and services:

• Grow and scale our market-leading HR Outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes (HRO Solutions). We offer comprehensive HRO solutions in which we provide complete management solutions for HR administration, payroll administration, talent management, employee benefits, benefits administration, employer liability management, and other HCM and employee benefits functions.
• Leverage our global presence to offer clients HCM solutions wherever they do business (Global Solutions). We are expanding our international HCM and HRO businesses, comprised of our established local, in-country software solutions and our market-leading, cloud-based multi-country solutions.


With a large and growing addressable market, we are strongly positioned to continue delivering sustainable long-term value across our strategic pillars. We are doing this by successfully executing on product and technology innovation, providing industry-leading service and compliance expertise, and enhancing our world-class distribution.

Innovation at ADP
Innovation is in our DNA. For 70 years, we have reimagined the world of work by designing cutting-edge products, robust services and exceptional experiences that touch millions of people’s lives daily. We pioneered automation in HCM, HCM in the cloud, mobile HCM and the establishment of an HCM marketplace. As the business and digital technology landscape rapidly evolves, what ‘work’ means, ‘how’ and ‘where’ it gets done, and ‘how’ workers are paid is changing as well. We innovate by anticipating the future of work, the future of HCM and the future of pay in order to meet the evolving and unique needs of our clients and their workers.
Our next-gen platforms are built for the ever-changing world of work. Designed from the ground up to be cloud-native, global, scalable and secure, our next-generation platforms provide our clients with the flexibility they need to address today’s and tomorrow’s workplace challenges, regardless of their size and complexity. Our next-generation HCM platform enables our clients to personalize their experience based on their needs. Built for dynamic teams, our next-gen HCM platform provides our clients with visibility into where work actually happens rather than into rigid organizational hierarchies and worker types. With our “HR your way” approach, clients can easily tailor the solution to their needs by deploying low-code applications. Our next-generation payroll solution supports workers of all types and enables real-time, transparent, continuous payroll calculations. Our next-gen payroll solution also unlocks flexible pay choices for our clients so they can provide the best pay experience for their workers. Compliance capabilities are built-in, enabling our clients to focus on managing their business. Our next-gen platforms are designed to meet the needs of our clients in an ever-changing world of work.
Today, harnessing big data for use in artificial intelligence (AI) is a real competitive advantage. That is why we are accelerating the deployment of AI - driven by big data based on our unmatched HCM dataset - into our solutions and into the hands of our clients and their decision-makers. This is the same HCM dataset that drives our renowned ADP National Employment Report®. We are leading this innovation effort with ADP® DataCloud, a workforce intelligence engine which provides clients with in-depth workforce and business insights driven by unmatched big data that enables critical HR decisions. Powered by ADP Datacloud, ADP’s Executive and Manager Insights solution continually sifts through wage, time, location, industry and other client data, to spot meaningful trends and patterns, such as which departments have the highest overtime or the locations where turnover might be spiking, and compares those trends and patterns to those in the client's industry. ADP’s Pay Equity Explorer combines analytics and benchmarking to help employers better understand potential pay gaps and provide them with real, up-to-date, aggregated and anonymized market data to understand how their compensation for a particular job compares to other similar employers. These innovative 


offerings combine HR expertise and data transparency in a way that connects HR to the bottom line.
Through our acquisition of WorkMarket, a cloud-based workforce management solution, we became the first HCM provider with robust freelancer management functionality and reporting insights, enabling clients to manage their extended workforce effectively. 
Wisely by ADP® is our latest advancement in the future of pay. Our innovative payment offerings support an employer’s need for flexible payment solutions in order to meet the individual needs of its workers. The Wisely Pay by ADP™ payroll card is a network-branded payroll card and digital account that enables employers to pay their employees, and enables employees to access their payroll funds immediately, including via a network member bank or an ATM, make purchases or pay bills, load additional funds onto the card, such as tax refunds and military pensions, and transfer funds to a bank account in the United States. We also launched Wisely Direct by ADP®, a network-branded general purpose reloadable card and digital account, which provides similar features and functionality as Wisely Pay by ADP but is offered directly to consumers. Our digital card offerings are true banking alternatives that feature innovative services such as savings, budgeting, digital wallet and other personal financial management features. With Wisely by ADP, we received the “Awesome New Tech” award at the 2018 HR Technology Conference for a record-breaking fourth straight year.
In addition, our mobile apps simplify how work gets done by enabling clients to process their payroll, and giving millions of their employees convenient access to their payroll and HR information around the world and in 29 languages. We have also opened access for developers and system integrators to some of our platforms’ application programming interface libraries through ADP Marketplace. With ADP Marketplace, clients can integrate employee data from our core services across their other business systems or platforms. This access enables the exchange of client data housed in our databases, and creates a unified HCM ecosystem for clients informed by a single, comprehensive repository of their workforce data. Clients can choose from over 370 apps and integrations, allowing them to choose solutions that are tailored to their needs, industry requirements and preferences.

HCM Solutions
Integrated HCM Solutions.  Our premier suite of HCM products offers complete solutions that assist employers of all types and sizes in all stages of the employment cycle, from recruitment to retirement.
Our suite of HCM solutions are powered by our strategic, cloud-based, award-winning platforms:
• RUN Powered by ADP combines a software platform for managing small business payroll, HR management and tax compliance administration, with 24/7 service and support from our team of small business experts. RUN Powered by ADP also integrates with other ADP solutions, such as workforce management, workers’ compensation insurance premium payment plans, and retirement plan administration systems.

• ADP Vantage HCM is a solution for large enterprises in the United States. It offers a comprehensive set of HCM capabilities within a single solution that unifies the five major areas of HCM: HR management, benefits administration, payroll services, time and attendance management, and talent management.
Payroll Services. We pay approximately 26 million (approximately 1 out of every 6) workers in the United States. We provide flexible payroll services to employers of all sizes, including the preparation of employee paychecks, pay statements, supporting journals, summaries, and management reports. We provide employers with a wide range of payroll options, including using mobile technology, connecting their major enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) applications with ADP’s payroll services or outsourcing their entire payroll process to us. Employers can choose a variety of payroll payment options including ADP’s electronic wage payment and, in the United States, payroll card solutions and digital accounts. On behalf of our clients in the United States, we prepare and file federal, state and local payroll tax returns and quarterly and annual Social Security, Medicare, and federal, state and local income tax withholding reports. 


Benefits Administration.  In the United States, we provide powerful and agile solutions for employee benefits administration. These options include health and welfare administration, leave administration services, insurance carrier enrollment services, employee communication services, and dependent verification services. In addition, ADP benefits administration solutions offer employers a simple and flexible cloud-based eligibility and enrollment system that provides their employees with tools, communications, and other resources they need to understand their benefits options and make informed choices.
Talent Management. ADP’s Talent Management solutions simplify and improve the talent acquisition, management, and activation process from recruitment to ongoing employee engagement and development. Employers can also outsource their internal recruitment function to ADP. Our solutions provide performance, learning, succession and compensation management tools that help employers align goals to outcomes, and enable managers to identify and mitigate potential retention risks. Our talent activation solutions include ADP’s StandOut® and Compass® solutions, which provide team leaders with data and insights to drive employee engagement and leadership development, which in turn help drive employee performance.
Workforce Management.  ADP’s Workforce Management offers a range of solutions to over 75,000 employers of all sizes, including time and attendance, absence management and scheduling tools. Time and attendance solutions include time capture via online timesheets, timeclocks with badge readers, biometrics and touch-screens, telephone/interactive voice response, and mobile smartphones and tablets. These tools automate the calculation and reporting of hours worked, helping employers prepare payroll, control costs and overtime, and manage compliance with wage and hour regulations. Absence management tools include accrued time 


7

off, attendance policy and leave case modules. Our employee scheduling tools simplify visibility, offer shift-swapping capabilities and can assist managers with optimizing schedules to boost productivity and minimize under- and over-staffing. We also offer analytics and reporting tools that provide clients with insights, benchmarks and performance metrics so they can better manage their workforce. In addition, industry-specific modules are available for labor forecasting, budgeting, activity and task management, grant and project tracking, and tips management.
Compliance Solutions.  ADP’s Compliance Solutions provides industry-leading expertise in payment compliance and employment-related tax matters that complement the payroll, HR and ERP systems of its clients.
• ADP SmartCompliance. In the United States, ADP SmartCompliance integrates client data delivered from our integrated HCM platforms or third-party payroll, HR and financial systems into a single, cloud-based solution. Our specialized teams use the data to work with clients to help them manage changing and complex regulatory landscapes and improve business processes. ADP SmartCompliance includes HCM-related compliance solutions such as Employment Tax and Wage Payments, as well as Tax Credits, Health Compliance, Wage Garnishments, Employment Verifications, Unemployment Claims and W-2 Management.
• ADP SmartCompliance Employment Tax. As part of our full service employment tax services in the United States, we prepare and file employment tax returns on our clients’ behalf and, in connection with these stand-alone services, collect employment taxes from clients and remit these taxes to more than 7,100 federal, state and local tax agencies. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, in the United States, we processed and delivered approximately 67 million employee year-end tax statements, and moved more than $2.1 trillion in client funds to taxing and other agencies and to our clients’ employees and other payees.
• ADP SmartCompliance Wage Payments. In the United States, we offer compliant pay solutions for today's workforce, including electronic payroll disbursement options such as payroll cards, digital accounts and direct deposit, as well as traditional payroll checks, which can be integrated with clients’ ERP and payroll systems.


Human Resources Management. Commonly referred to as Human Resource Information Systems, ADP’s Human Resources Management Solutions provide employers with a single system of record to support the entry, validation, maintenance, and reporting of data required for effective HR management, including employee names, addresses, job types, salary grades, employment history, and educational background. 
Insurance Services. ADP’s Insurance Services business, in conjunction with our licensed insurance agency, Automatic Data Processing Insurance Agency, Inc., facilitates access in the United States to workers’ compensation and group health insurance for small and mid-sized clients through a variety of insurance carriers. Our automated Pay-by-Pay® premium payment program calculates and collects workers’ compensation premium payments each pay period, simplifying this task for employers.
Retirement Services. ADP Retirement Services helps employers in the United States administer various types of retirement plans, such as traditional and Roth 401(k)s, profit sharing (including new comparability), SIMPLE and SEP IRAs, and executive deferred compensation plans. ADP Retirement Services offers a full service 401(k) plan program which provides recordkeeping and administrative services, combined with an investment platform offered through ADP Broker-Dealer, Inc. that gives our clients’ employees access to a wide range of non-proprietary investment options and online tools to monitor the performance of their investments.

HRO Solutions
As a leader in the growing HR Outsourcing market, we partner with our clients to offer a full range of seamless technology and service solutions for HR administration, workforce management, payroll services, benefits administration and talent management. From small businesses to enterprises with thousands of employees, with HRO our clients gain proven technology and processes and robust service and support. Whether a client chooses our PEO or other HR Outsourcing solutions, we offer solutions tailored to a client’s specific needs and preferences - designed to meet the client’s needs today, and as its business and needs evolve.
Professional Employer Organization.  ADP TotalSource, our PEO business, offers small and mid-sized businesses a comprehensive HR outsourcing solution through a co-employment model. With a PEO, both ADP and the client have a co-employment relationship with the client’s employees. We assume certain employer responsibilities such as payroll processing and tax filings, and the client maintains control of its business and all management responsibilities. ADP TotalSource clients are able to offer their employees services and benefits on par with those of much larger enterprises, without the need to staff an enterprise-size HR department. With our cloud-based HCM software at the core, we serve more than 12,500 clients and approximately 562,000 worksite employees in all 50 U.S. states. ADP TotalSource is the largest PEO certified by the Internal Revenue Service as meeting the requirements to operate as a Certified Professional Employer Organization under the Internal Revenue Code. As a full-service PEO, ADP TotalSource provides complete HR management and core administrative services while the client continues to direct the day-to-day job-related duties of the employees. 
With constantly changing business regulations, global economies and technology, our clients benefit from partnering with ADP TotalSource to help them protect their business and drive growth and success. Some of the rich offerings available through ADP TotalSource to address today’s workplace challenges include:
• Better Benefits: Through our PEO, many of our clients discover that they can offer a richer overall benefits package than they could afford to offer on their own. We give clients 


access to a new patent-pending approach to help them target the best benefit plan offerings for their employees. They can compare plan options and make more educated decisions about what plan offering is best for their company and budget. In addition, ADP TotalSource integrates with our award-winning ADP Marketplace to further tailor offerings, such as helping employees pay off student loans with payroll contributions and integrating a client’s U.S. PEO population with its global workforce’s HR system of record.
• Protection and Compliance: ADP TotalSource HR experts help clients manage the risks of being an employer by advising how to handle properly a range of issues - from HR and safety compliance to employee-relations. This includes access to workers' compensation coverage and expertise designed to help them handle both routine and unexpected incidents, including discrimination and harassment claims. 
• Talent Engagement: Featuring a talent blueprint, ADP TotalSource HR experts work with clients to help them better engage and retain their workforce through solutions that support the core needs of an employee at work. In addition, our full-service recruitment team is dedicated to helping our clients find and hire new talent, while reducing the stress of uncovering top talent.
• Expertise: Each client is assigned a designated HR specialist for day-to-day and strategic guidance. Clients can also access data-driven benchmarks in areas such as turnover and overtime, staffing and understanding profit leaks, and have their ADP HR expert help tailor recommendations to continue to drive their business forward.

Global Solutions
Our premier global solutions consist of multi-country and local in-country solutions for employers of any type or size. We partner with clients to help them navigate the most complex HR and payroll scenarios using tailored and scalable technology supported by our deep compliance expertise.
ADP Global Payroll is a solution for multinational organizations of all sizes. As a highly scalable and flexible suite of products supported by a team of experts, ADP Global Payroll allows small and mid-sized companies, as well as the largest multinationals, to standardize their HCM strategies globally (including payroll, HR, talent, time and labor, and benefits management) and adapt to changing local needs, while helping to drive overall organizational agility and engagement.
We also offer comprehensive HCM solutions on local, country-specific platforms. These suites of services offer various combinations of payroll services, HR management, time and attendance management, talent management and benefits management, depending on the country in which the solution is provided.


We pay approximately 15 million workers outside the United States with our local in-country solutions and with ADP GlobalView, ADP Celergo and ADP Streamline - our simplified and intuitive multi-country payroll solutions. As part of our global payroll services, we supply year-end regulatory and legislative tax statements and other forms to our clients’ employees. Our global talent management solutions elevate the employee experience, from recruitment to ongoing employee engagement and development. Our comprehensive HR solutions combined with our deep expertise make our clients’ global HR management strategies a reality. Our configurable, automated time and attendance tools help global clients understand the work being performed and the resources being used, and ensure the right people are in the right place at the right time.
MARKETS AND SALES
Our HCM solutions are offered in 140 countries and territories across North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The most material markets for HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions (other than PEO) are the United States, Canada and Europe. In each market, we have both country-specific solutions and multi-country solutions, for employers of all sizes and complexities. The major components of our offerings throughout these geographies are payroll, HR outsourcing and time and attendance management. In addition, we offer wage and tax collection and remittance services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Australia, India, and China. Our PEO business offers services exclusively in the United States.
We market our solutions primarily through our direct sales force. We also market HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions (other than PEO) through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with certified public accountants and banks, among others. None of our major business units has a single homogeneous client base or market. While concentrations of clients exist in specific 


10

industries, no one client, industry or industry group is material to our overall revenues. We are a leader in each of our major service offerings and do not believe any of our major services or business units is subject to unique market risk.
COMPETITION
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We know of no reliable statistics by which we can determine the number of our competitors, but we believe that we are one of the largest providers of HCM solutions in the world. HCM Solutions, Global Solutions and HRO Solutions (other than PEO) compete with other business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services, providers of cloud-based HCM solutions and financial institutions. Our PEO business competes with other PEOs providing similar services, as well as business outsourcing companies, companies providing ERP services and providers of cloud-based HCM solutions. Other competitive factors include a company’s in-house function, whereby a company installs and operates its own HCM system.
Competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on product and service quality, reputation, ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of offerings, and price. We believe that we are competitive in each of these areas and that our leading-edge technology, together with our commitment to service excellence, distinguishes us from our competitors.
INDUSTRY REGULATION
Our business is subject to a wide range of complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to them. We have, and continue to enhance, compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our operations and client solutions, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs.


As one of the world’s largest providers of HCM solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection and cybersecurity-related laws, including federal, state and foreign security breach notification laws with respect to both client employee data and our own employee data. The changing nature of these laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the European Union’s (the “EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), will impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients. The GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, imposes stricter and more comprehensive requirements on us as both a data controller and a data processor. As part of our overall data protection compliance program, including with respect to data protection laws in the EU, we have implemented Binding Corporate Rules (“BCRs”). Compliance with our BCRs permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in accordance with the GDPR and other data protection laws in the EU. The CCPA will become effective on January 1, 2020 and will require companies to provide new data disclosure, access, deletion and opt-out rights to consumers in California. In addition, in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 applies to our insurance services businesses and ADP TotalSource.
As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to taxing authorities, our clients’ employees, and other payees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, prepaid access and ADPCheck. Some elements of our U.S. money transmission activities, including our electronic payment and prepaid access (payroll pay card) offerings, are subject to certain licensing requirements. In addition, our U.S. prepaid access offering is subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2000 (the “BSA”). Elements of our money movement activities outside of the United States are subject to similar licensing and anti-money laundering and reporting laws and requirements in the countries in which we provide such services. Our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. ADP TotalSource is subject to various state licensing requirements and maintains certifications with the Internal Revenue Service. Because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees, we may be subject to limited obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws. Our registered investment adviser provides certain investment management and advisory services to retirement plan administrators under a heightened “fiduciary” standard and is regulated by the SEC and the U.S. Department of Labor.
In addition, many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain U.S. and foreign laws 


11

and regulations that apply to them. Although these laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services. For example, our payroll services are designed to facilitate compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to the payment of wages. In addition, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. Similarly, our Tax Credit Services business, which helps clients in the United States take advantage of tax credit opportunities in connection with the hiring of new employees and certain other activities, is based on federal, state, or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits, which are subject to renewal, amendment or rescission.
The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing or impacting our business. See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition or have other adverse consequences.
CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS
We provide services to more than 810,000 clients. In fiscal 2019, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of our annual consolidated revenues.
We are continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients. Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients can vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to nine months). In some cases, the period may exceed two years for a large, multi-country GlobalView client or other large, multi-phase implementation. Although we monitor sales that have not yet been installed, we do not view this metric as material to an understanding of our overall business in light of the recurring nature of our business. This metric is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool to allocate resources needed to install services, and as a means of assessing our performance against the expectations of our clients. In addition, some of our products and services are sold under longer term contracts with initial terms ranging from two to seven years. However, this anticipated future revenue under contract is not a significant portion of our expected future revenue, is not a meaningful indicator of our future performance and is not material to management's estimate of our future revenue.
Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue. Our services are provided under written price quotations or service 


agreements having varying terms and conditions. No one price quotation or service agreement is material to us. Our client retention is estimated at approximately 11 years in Employer Services, and approximately 6 years in PEO, and has not varied significantly from period to period.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
We continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our solutions and services. In general, new solutions and services supplement rather than replace our existing solutions and services and, given our recurring revenue model, do not have a material and immediate effect on our revenues. We believe that our strategic solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.
SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we invested approximately $911 million, $1 billion and $859 million, respectively, in systems development and programming. These investments include expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic cloud-based platforms, purchases of new software and software licenses, additions to software resulting from business combinations, as well as the development of new products and maintenance expenses associated with our existing technologies.
LICENSES
We are the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases. Our business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to our business as a whole.
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES
We employed approximately 58,000 persons as of June 30, 2019.
