Item 1. Business.
The Company
 TransAct Technologies Incorporated (“TransAct”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in June 1996 and began operating as a stand-alone business in August 1996 as a spin-off of the printer business that was formerly conducted by certain subsidiaries of Tridex Corporation.  We completed an initial public offering on August 22, 1996.
 
TransAct is a global leader in developing and selling software-driven technology and printing solutions for high growth markets including restaurant solutions, point of sale (“POS”) automation and banking, casino and gaming, lottery, and oil and gas.  Our world-class products are designed from the ground up based on market and customer requirements and are sold under the AccuDate™, EPICENTRAL™, Epic®, Ithaca®, and Printrex® brand names. Known and respected worldwide for innovative designs and real-world service reliability, our thermal, and inkjet printers and terminals generate top-quality labels, coupons and transaction records such as receipts, tickets and other documents, as well as printed logging and plotting of data. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), value-added resellers, select distributors, as well as directly to end-users. Our product distribution spans across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean Islands and the South Pacific. We also offer world-class service, spare parts, accessories and printing supplies to our growing worldwide base of products currently in use by our customers. Through our TransAct Services Group (“TSG”), we provide a complete range of supplies and consumables used in the printing and scanning activities of customers in the restaurant and hospitality, banking, retail, casino and gaming, government and oil and gas exploration markets.  Through our webstore, www.transactsupplies.com, and our direct selling team, we address the demand for these products. Our primary operating, hardware research and development, and eastern region service center is located in Ithaca, New York.  In addition, we have a casino and gaming sales headquarters, software research and development and western region service center in Las Vegas, Nevada; a European sales and service center at our subsidiary in the United Kingdom (“UK”), and a sales office located in Macau, China.  Our executive offices are located at One Hamden Center, 2319 Whitney Avenue, Suite 3B, Hamden, Connecticut, 06518, with a telephone number of (203) 859-6800.
 
Products, Services and Distribution Methods
 
Printers and terminals: TransAct designs, develops and markets a broad array of transaction-based and specialty printers and terminals utilizing thermal and inkjet printing technology for applications, primarily in the restaurant solutions, POS automation and banking, casino and gaming, lottery, and oil and gas printing markets.  Our printers and terminals are configurable and offer customers the ability to choose from a variety of features and functions.  Options typically include interface configuration, mounting configuration, paper cutting devices, paper handling capacities and cabinetry color.  Our restaurant solutions terminals also offer configurable menu options.  In addition to our configurable printers and terminals, we design and assemble custom printers for certain OEM customers.  In collaboration with these customers, we provide engineering and manufacturing expertise for the design and development of specialized printers tailored to our customers' business.
 
Restaurant Solutions: Our line of AccuDate™ terminals for the restaurant solutions market combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and “enjoy by” date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve, convenient stores  and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations.  Our newest addition to the AccuDate™ product line, the AccuDate XL2e, is a unique Android® 5.0-based restaurant management terminal specifically designed to meet the food preparation management and labeling needs of the restaurant and hospitality industries.  In 2019, we rebranded the AccuDate XL2e as BOHA!TM.  The BOHA!TM terminal can be used for food expiration date labeling and grab and go labeling, along with account management and an analytics portal.  In the restaurant solutions market, we use an internal sales force and, to a lesser extent distributors, to solicit sales directly from end-users.
 
POS automation and banking: In the POS market, we sell several models of printers utilizing thermal printing technology.  Our POS printers are used primarily by quick-serve restaurants located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels.  In the POS market, we primarily sell our products through a network of domestic and international distributors and resellers.  We use an internal sales force to manage sales through our distributors and resellers, as well as to solicit sales directly from end-users.  In the banking market, we sell inkjet printers that are used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit and withdrawal receipts and to validate checks at bank teller stations.   In the banking market, we primarily sell our products directly to end-user banks and financial institutions through the use of our internal sales force and, to a lesser extent, resellers.  We exited the banking market as of December 31, 2018 and therefore did not expect any future sales.
 
Casino and gaming:  We sell several models of printers used in slot machines and video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins (“ticket-in, ticket-out” or “TITO”) at casinos, racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide.  These printers utilize thermal printing technology to print tickets and receipts in monochrome, and offer various other features such as jam resistant bezels and a dual port interface that enables casinos to print coupons and promotions.  In addition, we sell printers using thermal roll-fed printing technology for use in non-casino establishments, including game types such as Amusements with Prizes, Skills with Prizes, Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and other off-premise gaming type machines around the world.  We sell our casino and gaming products primarily (1) to slot machine manufacturers, who incorporate our printers into slot machines and, in turn, sell completed slot machines directly to casinos and other gaming establishments and (2) through distributors.  Until December 31, 2017, the Suzo-Happ Group was our primary worldwide distributor.  However, effective January 1, 2018, we replaced Suzo-Happ Group with new distributors in Asia and Australia and adopted a direct selling model in Europe utilizing our UK sales office.  We also maintain a dedicated internal sales force to solicit sales from slot machine manufacturers and casinos, and to manage sales through our distributors.

We also offer a software solution, the EPICENTRAL™ Print System (“EPICENTRAL™” and “EPICENTRAL® SE”), including annual software maintenance, that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine. With EPICENTRAL™, casinos can utilize the system to create multiple promotions and incentives to either increase customer time spent on the casino floor or encourage additional visits to generate more revenue to the casinos.  In 2017, we introduced EPICENTRAL® SE, a system edition version our software solution, that is specifically designed to work with the existing bonusing modules of casino slot machine management systems.  In addition, EPICENTRAL® SE provides an upgrade path to a full EPICENTRALTM implementation in the event that an operator seeks to expand its promotion and bonusing options beyond the slot machine management systems currently offered.
 
Lottery:  We primarily supply lottery printers to International Gaming Technology and its subsidiaries (“IGT”), our largest customer and the world’s largest provider of lottery terminals.  We also sell the Epic 3000 printer, to our other lottery system customers.  Our lottery printers are designed for high-volume, high-speed printing of lottery tickets for various lottery applications.  Sales of our lottery products are made directly to IGT and other lottery system customers, and are managed by an internal sales representative.
 
Printrex:  Printrex printers include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black and white thermal printers used by customers in the oil and gas exploration industry to log and plot oil field and down hole well drilling data.  The Printrex® brand of printers also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used by oil and gas field service companies to print logs at their data centers.  We primarily sell our Printrex® products directly to oil field service and drilling companies and OEM’s, as well as through regional distributors in the United States, Europe, Canada and Asia.  We also maintain a dedicated Printrex® internal sales representative.
 
TSG:  Through TSG, we proactively market the sale of consumable products (including inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services and testing services for all of our products and certain competitor’s products.  Our maintenance services include the sale of extended warranties, multi-year maintenance contracts, 24-hour guaranteed replacement product service called TransAct Xpress™ and TransAct Care™, and other repair services for our printers and terminals.  Within the United States, we provide repair services through our eastern region service center in Ithaca, New York and our western region service center in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Internationally, we provide repair services through our European service center located in Doncaster, UK, and through partners strategically located around the world.
 
We also provide customers with telephone sales and technical support, and a personal account representative to handle orders, shipping and general information.  Technical and sales support personnel receive training on all of our manufactured products and services.
 
In addition to personalized telephone and technical support, we also market and sell consumable products 24 hours a day, seven days a week, via our online webstore www.transactsupplies.com.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 We design our products to optimize product performance, quality, reliability and durability.  These designs combine cost efficient materials, sourcing and assembly methods with high standards of workmanship.  Approximately 99% of our printer and terminal production is primarily through three third-party contract manufacturers in Asia.  The remaining 1% of our products are assembled in our Ithaca, New York facility largely on a configure-to-order basis using components and subassemblies that have been sourced from vendors and contract manufacturers around the world.
 
We procure component parts and subassemblies for use in the assembly of our hardware products in Ithaca, New York.  Critical component parts and subassemblies include thermal and inkjet print heads, printing/cutting mechanisms, power supplies, motors, injection molded plastic parts, LCD screens, circuit boards and electronic components, which are obtained from domestic and foreign suppliers at competitive prices.  As a result of the majority of our production being performed by our contract manufacturers, the majority of our purchases consist of fully-assembled printers and terminals produced by our contract manufacturers and, to a much lesser extent, component parts.  We typically strive to maintain more than one source for our component parts, subassemblies and fully assembled printers and terminals to reduce the risk of parts shortages or unavailability.  However, we could experience temporary disruption if certain suppliers ceased doing business with us, as described below.
 
We currently buy substantially all of our thermal print mechanisms, an important component of our thermal printers, and fully assembled printers for several of our printer and restaurant solutions terminal models, from one foreign contract manufacturer and to a much lesser extent, one other foreign contract manufacturer.  Although we believe that other contract manufacturers could provide similar thermal print mechanisms or fully assembled printers and terminals, on comparable terms, a change in contract manufacturers could cause a delay in manufacturing and possible loss of sales, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  Although we do not have supply agreements with our foreign contract manufacturers, our relationship with our largest one remains strong and we have no reason to believe that they will discontinue their supply of thermal print mechanisms or fully assembled printers to us during 2019 or that their terms to us will be substantially less favorable than they have been historically.  We are currently seeking to find a second source for our largest contract manufacturer in 2020.
 
Hewlett-Packard Company (“HP”) is the sole supplier of inkjet cartridges that are used in all of our banking inkjet printers.  Though we have exited the banking market as of December, 31, 2018, we still sell a substantial number of HP inkjet cartridges as a consumable product through TSG.  Although other inkjet cartridges are compatible with our banking inkjet printers, the loss of the supply of HP inkjet cartridges could have a material adverse effect on the sale of our TSG consumable products.  Our relationship with HP remains stable and we have no reason to believe that HP will discontinue its supply of inkjet cartridges to us or that their terms to us will be materially different than they have been historically.  The inkjet cartridges we purchase from HP are used not only in our inkjet printers for the POS automation and banking market, but also in other manufacturer’s printing devices across several other markets.
 
 2
 
Canon, Inc. (“Canon”) is the sole supplier of inkjet cartridges and other consumable items (“Canon Consumables”) that are used in our Printrex® 980 oil and gas printer.  The loss of supply of Canon Consumables would have a material adverse effect on the sale of Printrex 980® printers and the Canon Consumables.  We have a supply agreement with Canon to supply us with Canon Consumables until May 2019.  Prices under this agreement were fixed through May 2013, but may be changed during the remainder of the agreement if the exchange rate fluctuates significantly between the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar.
 
 Patents and Proprietary Information
 TransAct relies on a combination of trade secrets, patents, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws and contractual rights to establish and protect its proprietary rights in its products.  We hold 35 United States and 37 foreign patents and have 8 United States and 5 foreign patent applications pending pertaining to our products.  The duration of these patents range from 1 to 15 years.  The expiration of any individual patent would not have a significant negative impact on our business.  We regard certain manufacturing processes and designs to be proprietary and attempt to protect them through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and similar means.  It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use, to our detriment, information that we regard as proprietary.  Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries do not afford the same protection to our proprietary rights as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that legal protections we rely upon to protect our proprietary position will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies.
Trademarks, Service Marks and Copyrights
 We own or have rights to trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights that we use in connection with the operation of our business, including our corporate names, logos and website names. Other trademarks, service marks and trade names appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.  The trademarks we own include TransAct®, BOHA!TM, AccuDate™, Epic, EPICENTRAL™, Ithaca® and Printrex®. Solely for convenience, some of the trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K are listed without the ©, ® and ™ symbols, but we will assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our trademarks, service marks, trade names and copyrights.
Seasonality
 Restaurants typically reduce purchases of equipment in the fourth quarter due to the increased volume of transactions during the holiday period, which may negatively impact sales of our restaurant solutions terminals or POS printers.
Working Capital
 Inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable levels, payment terms, and where applicable, return policies are in accordance with the general practices of the industry and standard business procedures.  See also Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Certain Customers
 IGT is our most significant customer and has been since 1996.  On May 29, 2015, we signed an agreement with IGT to sell on-line lottery and casino printers to IGT on a non-exclusive basis through December 31, 2019.   Under the terms of the agreement, we sell on-line lottery and casino printers to IGT on a non-exclusive basis, and IGT purchases such printers from us on a non-exclusive basis. This agreement allows TransAct to sell printers to other lottery system customers beyond IGT.
 
In September 2013, we signed an agreement with Suzo-Happ to be our exclusive worldwide distributor of casino and gaming products through December 31, 2017.  We did not renew the agreement upon its expiration.  Beginning January 1, 2018, we replaced Suzo-Happ with new distributors in Asia and Australia and expanded our sales office in the UK to begin selling directly to end-user customers in Europe.
 
Sales to IGT and Suzo-Happ representing 10% or more of our total net sales were as follows:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
----------+-------------------------+---
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
IGT | | 18 | % | | 35 | % | 26 | %
Suzo-Happ | | 1 | % | | 8 | % | 15 | %

Backlog
 Our backlog of firm orders was approximately $6.9 million as of February 28, 2019, compared to $10.3 million as of February 28, 2018.  Based on customers’ current delivery requirements, we expect to fill and recognize as revenue $5.4 million of our current backlog during 2019 and the remaining $1.5 million during 2020.
Competition
 The market for transaction-based and specialty printers and restaurant solutions terminals is extremely competitive, and we expect such competition to continue in the future.  However, we experience less competition for EPICENTRALTM software due to the highly customized nature of the product.  We compete with a number of companies, many of which have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than TransAct.  We believe our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control, including durability, reliability, quality, design capability, product customization, price, customer support, success in developing new products, manufacturing expertise and capacity, supply of component parts and materials, strategic relationships with suppliers, the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors, general market, economic and political conditions and, in some cases, the uniqueness of our products.

In the restaurant solutions market, we compete with Avery Dennison Corporation, Ecolab Inc., ITD Food Safety, CMC Daymark and Integrated Control Corp.  We compete in this market based largely on our ability to provide highly specialized software and purpose-built products and ongoing technical support.
 
In the POS automation and banking market, we primarily compete with Epson America, Inc., which holds a dominant market position of the POS markets into which we sell.  We also compete, to a much lesser extent, with CognitiveTPG, Star Micronics America, Inc., Citizen -- CBM America Corporation, Pertech Industries, Inc., Addmaster, and Samsung/Bixolon.  Certain competitors of ours have greater financial resources and lower costs attributable to higher volume production which enables them to occasionally offer lower prices than us.  However, we have exited the banking market and will continue to deemphasize efforts in the POS automation market going forward as we have shifted our focus toward our higher-value, technology enabled restaurant solutions and casino and gaming products.
 
In the casino and gaming market (consisting principally of slot machine printing, VLT transaction printing and promotional coupon printing), we compete with several companies including JCM Global, Nanoptix, Inc., Custom Engineering SPA, Eurocoin and others.  Certain of our products sold for casino and gaming applications compete based upon our ability to provide highly specialized products, custom engineering and ongoing technical support.
 
In the lottery market (consisting principally of on-line lottery transaction printing), we compete with other lottery printer providers such as Custom Engineering SPA, Star Micronics and Wincor Nixdorf.
 
In the oil and gas market, our Printrex® products compete primarily with the products of Imaging Systems Group, Inc. and Neuralog Inc.  We compete in this market based largely on our ability to provide specialized, custom-engineered products.
 
The market in which TSG competes is highly fragmented, and we compete with numerous competitors of various sizes, including POS and internet resellers, and label converters depending on the geographic area.
 
Our strategy for competing in our markets is to continually develop new products (hardware and software), such as BOHA!TM in 2019, and product line extensions that are technologically advanced and provide differentiated features and functions, to increase our geographic market penetration, to take advantage of strategic relationships, and to lower the cost of our product by sourcing certain products overseas.  Although we believe that our products, operations and relationships provide a competitive foundation, there can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the future.  In addition, our products utilize certain thermal and inkjet printing technologies.  If other technologies, or variations to existing technologies, were to evolve or become available to us, it is possible that we would incorporate these technologies into our products.  Alternatively, if such technologies were to evolve or become available to our competitors, our products could become obsolete, which could have a significant negative impact on our business.
