Item 1. Business.
Overview
Noble Corporation plc (formerly known as Noble Finco Limited), a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry. We provide contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry with our global fleet of mobile offshore drilling units. We focus on a high-specification fleet of floating and jackup rigs and the deployment of our drilling rigs in oil and gas basins around the world. Noble and its predecessors have been engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells since 1921. As of December 31, 2022, our fleet of 32 drilling rigs consisted of 19 floaters and 13 jackups.
On July 31, 2020 (the “Petition Date”), our former parent company, Noble Holding Corporation plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (“Legacy Noble” or the “Predecessor”), and certain of its subsidiaries, including Finco, filed voluntary petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) seeking relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). On September 4, 2020, the Debtors (as defined herein) filed with the Bankruptcy Court the Joint Plan of Reorganization of Noble Corporation plc and its Debtor Affiliates, which was subsequently amended on October 8, 2020 and October 13, 2020 and modified on November 18, 2020 (as amended, modified or supplemented, the “Plan”), and the related disclosure statement. On September 24, 2020, six additional subsidiaries of Legacy Noble (together with Legacy Noble and its subsidiaries that filed on the Petition Date, as the context requires, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions in the Bankruptcy Court. The chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption Noble Corporation plc, et al. (Case No. 20-33826) (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). On November 20, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the Plan, on and prior to the Emergence Effective Date (as defined herein), Legacy Noble and certain of its subsidiaries effectuated certain restructuring transactions pursuant to which Legacy Noble formed Noble Cayman, as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Noble and transferred to Noble Cayman substantially all of the subsidiaries and other assets of Legacy Noble. On February 5, 2021 (the “Emergence Effective Date”), the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms, the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases and Noble Cayman became the new parent company. In accordance with the Plan, Legacy Noble and its remaining subsidiary will in due course be wound down and dissolved in accordance with applicable law. The Bankruptcy Court closed the Chapter 11 Cases with respect to all Debtors other than Legacy Noble, pending its wind down.
On September 30, 2022 (the “Merger Effective Date”), pursuant to a Business Combination Agreement, dated November 10, 2021 (as amended, the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among Noble, Noble Cayman, Noble Newco Sub Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble (“Merger Sub”), and The Drilling Company of 1972 A/S, a Danish public limited liability company (“Maersk Drilling”), Noble Cayman merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble. As a result of the Merger, Noble became the ultimate parent of Noble Cayman and its respective subsidiaries. 
On October 3, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, Noble completed a voluntary tender exchange offer to Maersk Drilling’s shareholders (the “Offer” and, together with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”) and because Noble acquired more than 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Maersk Drilling, nominal value Danish krone (“DKK”) 10 per share (“Maersk Drilling Shares”), Noble redeemed all remaining Maersk Drilling Shares not exchanged in the Offer for, at the election of the holder, either A ordinary shares, par value $0.00001 per share, of Noble (“Ordinary Shares”) or cash (or, for those holders that did not make an election, only cash), under Danish law by way of a compulsory purchase (the “Compulsory Purchase”) which was completed in early November 2022. Upon completion of the Compulsory Purchase, Maersk Drilling became a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble.
For additional information on the Business Combination, see “Note 4— Acquisitions and Divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As a result of the emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, Noble Cayman became the successor issuer to Legacy Noble for purposes of and pursuant to the Exchange Act. As a result of the Merger, Noble became the successor issuer to Noble Cayman for purposes of and pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) of the Exchange Act. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K 
to “Noble,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer collectively to (i) Legacy Noble and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the Emergence Effective Date, (ii) Noble Cayman and its consolidated subsidiaries on and after the Emergence Effective Date and prior to the Merger Effective Date, and (iii) Noble and its consolidated subsidiaries (including Noble Cayman) on and after the Merger Effective Date, as applicable.
Upon emergence, the Company applied fresh start accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 852 – Reorganizations (“ASC 852”). The application of fresh start accounting resulted in a new basis of accounting and the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, our financial statements and notes after the Emergence Effective Date are not comparable to our financial statements and notes on and prior to that date. 
Finco was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Noble prior to the Emergence Effective Date and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Cayman on and after the Emergence Effective Date and prior to the Merger Effective Date, and has been an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Noble on and after the Merger Effective Date. As of December 31, 2022, Noble’s principal asset is all of shares of Finco. Finco has no public equity outstanding. The consolidated financial statements of Noble include the accounts of Finco, and Noble conducts substantially all of its business through Finco and its subsidiaries. As such, the terms “Predecessor” and “Successor” also refers to Finco, as the context requires. 
Strategy
Our business strategy is centered around efficient, reliable and safe offshore drilling to provide the best services for our customers. The Business Combination with Maersk Drilling created one of the youngest and highest specification fleets of global scale in the industry, with diversification across asset classes, geographic regions and customers. The Combined company has a track record of industry-leading utilization; coupled with an unwavering commitment to best-in-class safety performance and customer satisfaction. We strive to be a leader in industry innovation and first-mover in sustainability.
Our fleet consists predominately of technologically advanced units, equipped with sophisticated systems and components prepared to execute our customers’ increasingly complicated offshore drilling programs safely and with greater efficiency contributing to an overall reduction of our carbon footprint. We are primarily focused on the ultra-deepwater market and the harsh, and ultra-harsh environment jackup markets, which typically present more technically challenging conditions in which to operate.
We emphasize safe operations, environmental stewardship, and superior performance through a structured management system, the employment of qualified and well-trained crews and onshore support staff, the care of our surroundings and the neighboring communities where we operate, and other activities advancing our environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and good governance. We also manage rig operating costs through the implementation and continuous improvement of innovative systems and processes, which includes the use of data analytics and predictive maintenance technology.
Our organization prioritizes financial discipline, cash flow generation and returning cash to shareholders. We will focus on ensuring that our fleet of floating and jackup rigs meet the demands of increasingly complex drilling programs required by our customers as well as ensuring that we continue to maintain a strong financial position.
Climate change is an environmental, social and economic challenge facing everyone today. We are committed to continuous improvement and a sustainable energy future, supported by our efforts to protect the environment throughout our operations and safely provide reliable and efficient services to allow access to resources essential for human and economic prosperity. We actively look to partner with our customers to evaluate economic alternatives for reducing the carbon footprint of our drilling rigs. Oversight of our sustainability is at the Board level, with the Safety and Sustainability Committee assisting in that oversight role with respect to the Corporation’s sustainability policies and practices.
Contract Drilling Services
We report our contract drilling operations as a single reportable segment, Contract Drilling Services, which reflects how we manage our business. The mobile offshore drilling units comprising our offshore rig fleet operate in a global market for contract drilling services and are often redeployed to different regions due to changing demands of our customers, which consist primarily of large, integrated, independent and government-owned or controlled oil and gas companies throughout the world.
We typically provide contract drilling services under an individual contract, on a dayrate basis. Each contract’s final terms and conditions are the result of negotiations with our customers, and many contracts are awarded through a competitive bidding process. The following terms generally describe the key aspects of our contracts:
•contract duration extending over a specific period of time or a period necessary to drill a defined number of wells;
•payment of compensation to us (generally in US Dollars although some customers, typically national oil companies, require a part of the compensation to be paid in local currency) on a “daywork” basis, so that we receive a fixed amount for each day (“dayrate”) that the drilling unit is operating under contract (a lower rate or no compensation is payable during periods of equipment breakdown and repair or adverse weather or in the event operations are interrupted by other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control);
•provisions permitting early termination of the contract by the customer (i) if the unit is lost or destroyed, (ii) if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to breakdown of equipment or breach of contract or (iii) for convenience with the payment of contractually specified termination amounts;
•provisions allowing the impacted party to terminate the contract if specified “force majeure” events beyond the contracting parties’ control occur for a defined period of time;
•payment by us of the operating expenses of the drilling unit, including labor costs and the cost of incidental supplies;
•provisions that allow us to recover our mobilization and demobilization costs associated with moving a drilling unit from one regional location to another which, under certain market conditions, may not allow us to receive full reimbursement of such costs;
•provisions that allow us to recover certain cost increases from our customers in certain long-term contracts; 
•provisions that require us to lower dayrates for documented cost decreases in certain long-term contracts; and
•provisions that allocate responsibility and liability through indemnification provisions for risks related to personal injury, property damage or loss, environmental damages, damage to the reservoir and other matters.
During periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we recently experienced for a number of years, our customers may attempt to renegotiate or repudiate their contracts with us although we seek to enforce our rights under our contracts. The renegotiation may include changes to key contract terms, such as pricing, termination and risk allocation.
For a discussion of our backlog of commitments for contract drilling services, please read Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Contract Drilling Services Backlog.”
Drilling Fleet
Noble is a leading offshore drilling contractor for the oil and gas industry. Noble owns and operates one of the most modern, versatile and technically advanced fleets of mobile offshore drilling units in the offshore drilling industry. Noble provides, through its subsidiaries, contract drilling services with a fleet of 32 offshore drilling units, consisting of 19 floaters and 13 jackups at the date of this report, focused largely on ultra-deepwater and harsh environment drilling opportunities in both established and emerging regions worldwide. Each type of drilling rig is described further below. Several factors determine the type of unit most suitable for a particular job, the most significant of which include the water depth and the environment of the intended drilling location, whether the drilling is being done over a platform or other structure, and the intended well depth. At December 31, 2022, our fleet was located in Africa, Far East Asia, the Middle East, the North Sea, Oceania, South America and the US Gulf of Mexico. Our fleet consists of the following types of mobile offshore drilling units: 
Floaters. A drillship is a type of floating drilling unit that is based on the ship-based hull of the vessel and equipped with modern drilling equipment that gives it the capability of easily transitioning from various worldwide locations and carrying high capacities of equipment while being able to drill ultra-deepwater oil and gas wells in up to 12,000 feet of water. Drillships can stay directly over the drilling location without anchors in open seas using a dynamic positioning system (“DPS”), which coordinates position references from satellite signals and acoustic seabed transponders with the drillship's six to eight thrusters to keep the ship directly over the well that is being drilled. Drillships are selected to drill oil and gas wells for programs that require a high level of simultaneous operations, where drilling loads are expected to be high, or 
where there are occurrences of high ocean currents, where the drillship's hull shape is the most efficient. Noble's fleet consists of 15 drillships capable of water depths from 10,000 feet to 12,000 feet.
Semisubmersible drilling units are designed as a floating drilling platform incorporating one or several pontoon hulls, which are submerged in the water to lower the center of gravity and make this type of drilling unit exceptionally stable in the open sea. Semisubmersible drilling units are generally categorized in terms of the water depth in which they are capable of operating, from the mid-water range of 300 feet to 4,000 feet, the deepwater range of 4,000 feet to 7,500 feet, to the ultra-deepwater range of 7,500 feet to 12,000 feet as well as by their generation, or date of construction. This type of drilling unit typically exhibits excellent stability characteristics, providing a stable platform for drilling in even rough seas. Semisubmersible drilling units hold their position over the drilling location using either an anchored mooring system or a DPS and may be self-propelled. Noble’s fleet consists of four moored ultra-deepwater semisubmersible drilling units.
Jackups. Jackup drilling units are designed to provide drilling solutions in depths ranging from less than 100 feet to as deep as 500 feet of water with drilling hookloads up to 2,500,000 pounds. Jackup rigs can be used in open water exploration locations, as well as over fixed, bottom-supported platforms. A jackup drilling unit is a towed mobile vessel consisting of a floating hull equipped with three or four legs, which are lowered to the seabed at the drilling location. The hull is then elevated out of the water by the jacking system using the legs to support the weight of the hull and drilling equipment against the seabed. Once the hull is elevated to the desired level, or jacked up, the drilling package can be extended out over an existing production platform or the open water location and drilling can commence. Noble’s fleet of 13 jackups consists of high-specification units capable of drilling in up to 500 feet of water.
The following table presents certain information concerning our offshore fleet at February 26, 2023. We own and operate all of the units included in the table.

Market
The offshore contract drilling industry is a highly competitive and cyclical business. Demand for offshore drilling services is driven by the offshore exploration and development programs of oil and gas operators, which in turn are influenced by many factors. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the price and price stability of oil and gas, the relative cost and carbon footprint of offshore resources within each operator’s broader energy portfolio, global macroeconomic conditions, world energy demand, the operator’s strategy toward renewable energy sources, environmental considerations and governmental policies.
In the provision of offshore contract drilling services, success in securing contracts is primarily governed by price, a rig’s availability, drilling capabilities and technical specifications and the drilling contractor’s safety performance record. Other factors include experience of the workforce, process efficiency, condition of equipment, operating integrity, reputation, industry standing and client relations.
We maintain a global operational presence and compete in many of the major offshore oil and gas basins worldwide with a primary focus on the ultra-deepwater market and the harsh, and ultra-harsh environment jackup markets. All our drilling rigs are mobile, and we may reposition our drilling rigs among regions for a variety of reasons, including in response to customer requirements. We compete in both the jackup and floating rig markets, each of which may have different supply and demand dynamics at a given period in time or in different regions.
The Business Combination with Maersk Drilling created one of the youngest and highest specification fleets of global scale in the industry, with diversification across asset classes, geographic regions and customers. The combined company has a track record of industry-leading utilization; coupled with an unwavering commitment to best-in-class safety performance and customer satisfaction. We strive to be a leader in industry innovation and first-mover in sustainability.
Over the last decade, the offshore drilling industry has experienced significant volatility and change, which has meaningfully impacted both the supply of, and demand for, offshore rigs. After several years of a significantly oversupplied rig market, industry conditions had started to gradually improve in 2019, which was evidenced by increasing utilization and improving dayrates. However, in the first half of 2020, this gradual recovery was abruptly halted as oil prices experienced concurrent supply and demand shocks. The supply shock was driven by production disagreements among OPEC+ members that resulted in a sudden and a significant oversupply of oil, and the demand shock by the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in a meaningful reduction in global economic activity and produced significant uncertainty among our customers. This had a negative impact on both utilization and dayrates for the offshore drilling industry and led to further financial challenges for many drilling and other service companies. However, by early 2021, oil prices returned to pre-pandemic levels and continued to rise throughout 2021. 
During 2022, oil prices generally remained at levels that were supportive of offshore exploration and development activity. While the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions, inflationary pressures and the subsequent government and central bank efforts to curb inflation, recession concerns, and supply chain disruptions did create some uncertainty relating to future global energy demand, global rig demand increased in 2022. 
This rise was the result of the combination of growing confidence in commodity prices remaining at or above current levels, heightened focus on energy security, recent multi-year underinvestment in the development and exploration of hydrocarbons, and relative attractiveness of offshore plays with respect to both cost and a carbon emissions perspective resulted in an overall increase in global rig demand in 2022. This had a positive impact on both utilization and day rates for certain of our rig classes. 
The global rig supply has come down from historic highs as Noble and other offshore drilling contractors have retired less capable and idle assets. Concurrently, the incoming supply of newbuild offshore drilling rigs has diminished materially, with 
several newbuild rigs stranded in shipyards. However, we expect many of these stranded newbuild rigs may make their way into the global market over the next few years.
Although the market outlook in our business varies by geographical region and water depth, we remain encouraged by the recovery in the ultra-deepwater floater market, with overall demand having increased from 2020 lows. Our customers continue to focus on the highest specification floaters, which represents the majority of our floater fleet. We have also experienced an overall increase in the global jack-up market, with the Middle East being the largest component of this increase.
As of the date of this report, the majority of our jack-up fleet is positioned in the North Sea. While we are starting to see some increased tender activity in the UK North Sea, overall activity levels remain subdued compared to historical levels. It is currently a similar story in the Norway ultra-harsh environment jackup market where current activity also remains below historical levels, despite the market being attractive to operators given it is characterized by low-cost and low-emission barrels.
The energy transition from hydrocarbons to renewables poses a challenge to the oil and gas sector and our market. Energy rebalancing trends have accelerated in recent years as evidenced by promulgated or proposed government policies and commitments by many of our customers to further invest in sustainable energy sources. Our industry could be further challenged as our customers rebalance their capital investments more towards alternative energy sources. However, at the same time, there continues to be a global dependence on the combustion of hydrocarbons to provide reliable and affordable energy. Low-cost and low-emission barrels are still necessary to meet energy needs, both current and future. Global energy demand is predicted to increase over the coming decades, and we expect that offshore oil and gas will continue to play an important and sustainable role in meeting this demand.
We expect inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions to persist, and potentially accelerate, which has led or may lead to increased costs of services.

Human Capital
In connection with the completion of the Business Combination with Maersk Drilling in October 2022, we increased the size of our combined workforce. As such, at December 31, 2022, we had approximately 3,800 employees, excluding approximately 2,000 persons we engaged through labor contractors or agencies. Approximately 80 percent of our workforce is located offshore. Certain of our employees and contractors in international markets, such as Norway and Denmark, are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation, and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
For additional information, please read Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risk Related to Our Business and Operations—Unionization efforts, labor interruptions and labor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.”
Our compliance program is focused on ensuring adherence with high ethical standards and applicable laws and setting the tone for an ethical business practices and work environment throughout the Company. Noble’s commitment to a strong compliance culture is fundamental to who we are as a leading offshore drilling contractor. We are also committed to uphold 
our Core Value of respecting the dignity and worth of all employees and are committed to advancing a more diverse and inclusive workplace. The Noble Code, Noble’s code of business conduct and ethics (the “Code of Conduct”), exemplifies the foundation of our commitments to our Core Values of safety, environmental stewardship, honesty and integrity, respect and performance. The Code of Conduct also includes our responsibility and commitment to follow all applicable laws as well as our own internal policies, and extends requirements to any supplier or third party who works with Noble to comply with similar fundamental principles.
Operating our business in a socially responsible way is integral to our identity. Internally, our employee-focused programs, such as training and continuing education, our promotion and advancement program, diversity, equity, and inclusion, recruitment initiatives, and retirement and benefits, are key to our commitment to the personal and professional growth of our workforce. Externally, our dedication is evidenced by our affiliations and how we contribute to and invest in the communities where we operate. 
Recruitment and Promotions. We value a healthy culture of ingenuity and adaptability where everyone has an equal opportunity to thrive. We recognize that an inclusive and diverse workforce is key to the advancement and retention of the best qualified people leading to strong innovation and our continued success. We are committed to a policy of recruitment and promotion based upon job qualifications, performance and merit without discrimination.
Safety and Environmental Stewardship. Noble is committed to operating with excellent health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) performance as part of our business strategy in order to add further value for employees, customers and shareholders. Safety and environmental stewardship are cornerstones of who we are, what we stand for and what we do every day to deliver a high-quality operation. All personnel, regardless of job or position onboard our vessels or at any Noble facility, has the authorization and obligation to immediately stop any unsafe act, practice or job that poses an unaddressed or unreasonable risk or danger to people or the environment. Noble’s pursuit of exceptional HSE performance begins with our strong corporate culture and by starting SAFE every day: one tour, one task and one person at a time. SAFE is an acronym for the phrase: follow Standards, be Accountable, stay Focused, achieve Excellence. Daily, the crew onboard each rig work together to achieve specific safety and environmental objectives and if all objectives are met, then the day is counted as a SAFE Day. Under our SAFE Day program, in 2022, our rigs achieved the SAFE objectives 98.4% of available days, which is a slight decrease over 2021 performance. As of December 31, 2022, this metric was only available to vessels owned by Noble prior to the Business Combination with Maersk Drilling, and is being phased in across the vessels acquired as part of the Business Combination. When integration activities are complete, all current Noble vessels will be utilizing this program.
Training and Continuing Education. We place considerable value on the training and development of our employees and maintain a practice of keeping them informed on matters affecting them, as well as on the performance of the Company. Accordingly, we conduct formal and informal meetings with employees, regular executive-led podcasts, issue periodic publications of Company activities and other matters of interest to the Company’s OneNoble app and offer a variety of training, including in-house through NobleAdvances, our state-of-the-art training facility in Sugar Land, Texas. NobleAdvances and our experienced team of instructors have provided introductory level training, intermediate and advanced well-specific scenario training for Noble employees, industry professionals and third party industry service providers.
NobleAdvances allows us to deliver Noble-specific training that includes our policies, procedures and culture. Incorporating this into our well control and cyber training has proven to be important to training. The commitment to keep the center running and provide world-class training throughout the downturn has shown our clients that our commitment to safety and excellence is the Noble way. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and incorporated virtual and worksite training courses into our existing infrastructure, some of which are facilitated through our rig-based leadership and are accredited through the International Association of Drilling Contractors.

Our environmental commitment is to protect our world and its resources in a manner consistent with our Mission and Core Values. With our experience and procedural discipline, we are able to operate with excellence, and deliver efficient and reliable services for the benefit of our customers as well as our community, which includes everyone from our investors, to our workers and the communities where we live and operate. 
Political developments and numerous governmental regulations, which may relate directly or indirectly to the contract drilling industry, may affect different aspects of our operations. Our contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the equipping, supplying and operation of drilling units; environmental protection and related recordkeeping; health and safety of personnel, maintaining 
an effective safety management systems; the reduction of air emission gasses that are attributed to the destabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere (commonly referred to as greenhouse gases); economic sanctions; currency conversions and repatriation; oil and gas exploration and development; taxation of capital equipment, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; employee benefits and use of local employees, content and suppliers by foreign contractors. A number of countries actively regulate and control the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exportation of oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In addition, government actions, including initiatives by OPEC and OPEC+, may continue to contribute to oil price volatility. In some areas of the world, this government activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by oil and gas companies and influenced their need for offshore drilling services, and likely will continue to do so.
The regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge or release of materials into the environment or require remediation of contamination under certain circumstances. Many of the countries in whose waters we operate from time to time regulate the discharge of oil and other potential contaminants in connection with drilling and marine operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to obtain or comply with permits, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial requirements, or the imposition of injunctions to force future compliance. Although these requirements impact the oil and gas and offshore energy services industries, generally, they do not appear to affect us in any material respect that is different, or to any materially greater or lesser extent, than other companies in the offshore energy services industry. However, our business and prospects could be adversely affected by regulatory activity that prohibits or restricts our customers’ exploration and production activities, resulting in reduced demand for our services or imposing environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to us, our customers or the oil and natural gas industry in general.
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws and regulations that apply in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, which serves as an example of the various laws and regulations to which we are subject. While laws vary widely in each jurisdiction, each of the laws and regulations summarized below addresses regulatory issues similar to those in most of the other jurisdictions in which we operate.
Offshore Regulation and Safety. The United States Congress, the US Department of Interior, through the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), the US Department of Homeland Security, through the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) undertook an aggressive overhaul of the offshore oil and natural gas related regulatory processes in response to the Macondo well blowout incident in April 2010, which has significantly impacted oil and gas development and operational requirements in the US Gulf of Mexico. Such actions by the US government have, on occasion, served as a leading indicator for similar regulatory developments or requirements by other countries where, from time to time, new rules, regulations and requirements in the United States and in other countries have been proposed and implemented that materially limit or prohibit, and increase the cost of, offshore drilling and related operations. Other similar regulations impact certain operational requirements on rigs and govern liability for vessel or cargo loss, or damage to life, property, or the marine environment. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors —Regulatory and Legal Risks—Changes in, compliance with, or our failure to comply with the certain laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Regulatory and Legal Risks—Governmental laws and regulations may add to our costs, result in delays, or limit our drilling activity” for additional information.
Spills and Releases. The US Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act in the United States (“CERCLA”), and similar regulations, including but not limited to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”), adopted by the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), as enforced in the United States through the domestic implementing laws, such as the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, impose certain operational requirements on offshore rigs operating in the United States and govern liability for leaks, spills and blowouts involving pollutants. OPA imposes strict, joint and several liabilities on “responsible parties” for damages, including natural resource damages, resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an offshore facility and the lessee or permit holder of the area in which an offshore facility is located. CERCLA and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, impose joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate waste that may fall within the scope of CERCLA's definition of a “hazardous substance.” However, we have to-date not received any notification that we are, or may be, potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA.
Regulations under OPA require owners and operators of rigs in United States waters to maintain certain levels of financial responsibility. The failure to comply with OPA’s requirements may subject a responsible party to civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement actions. We are not aware of any action or event that would subject us to liability under OPA, and we believe that compliance with OPA’s financial assurance and other operating requirements will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Waste Handling. The US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and similar state, local and foreign laws and regulations govern the management of wastes, including the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA imposes stringent operating requirements, and liability for failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either a “generator” or “transporter” of hazardous waste or an “owner” or “operator” of a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility. RCRA and many state counterparts specifically exclude from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas. As a result, our operations generate minimal quantities of RCRA hazardous wastes. We do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as they are presently classified, to be significant. However, any repeal or modification of this or similar exemption in similar state statutes, would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of, and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses with respect to our US operations.
Water Discharges. The US Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,” and similar state laws and regulations impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. These laws also regulate the discharge of cooling water in process areas. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits, or report information related to the discharge of wastewater and cooling water. In addition, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments requires ships to manage their ballast water to remove, render harmless, or avoid the uptake or discharge of aquatic organisms and pathogens within ballast water and sediments. The US Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 and the US National Invasive Species Act (NISA 1996) have served as the foundation for requirements for ballast water management as well as supplemental ballast water requirements, which includes limits and, in some cases, water treatment requirements applicable to specific discharge streams, such as deck runoff, bilge water and gray water. Further, in 2018 the US Vessel Incidental Discharge Act was signed into law, which was intended to restructure how the EPA and USCG would regulate incidental discharges, primarily from commercial vessels, into waters of the United States and the contiguous zone by adding a new subsection (p) to Section 312 of the Clean Water Act. In 2020, the EPA published a proposed rule that would establish discharge standards for a range of vessels, including mobile offshore drilling units. With limited exceptions, proposed standards are anticipated to be at least as stringent as National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) requirements established under the Clean Water Act. The regulations anticipated from the USCG may also include requirements governing the design, construction, testing, approval, installation, and use of devices to achieve EPA standards of performance. In the interim, the NPDES and VGP requirements remain in place and we do not anticipate that compliance with these new laws and regulations will cause a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Air Emissions. The US Clean Air Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authorizes the Department of the Interior (DOI) to regulate US Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) activities authorized by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and the EPA has air quality jurisdiction over all other parts of the US OCS. In addition, associated state laws and regulations restrict certain air emissions from many sources, including oil and natural gas operations. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. In general, we believe that compliance with the Clean Air Act and corresponding regulations, and similar state laws and regulations will not have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.
Climate Change. Climate change is an environmental, social and economic challenge facing everyone today. We are committed to continuous improvement and a sustainable energy future, supported by our efforts to protect the environment throughout our operations and safely provide reliable and efficient services to allow access to resources essential for human and economic prosperity. There is ongoing attention concerning the global climate and the effect of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Various regulators have proposed or adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among other things, certain offshore activities relating to oil and gas production.
Moreover, in 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which operationalized the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change set binding emission reduction targets 
against 1990 levels for 37 countries (including the US and UK) and the European Union. In 2015, the United Nations (“U.N.”) Climate Change Conference in Paris resulted in an agreement (“Paris Agreement”) to which the US returned as a party in February 2021. The Paris Agreement required countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions every five years beginning in 2020. The various international conventions and agreements are expected to result in additional laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations, including energy conservation incentives, in the US, UK, Denmark, and other countries where we have a presence and could have a material adverse effect on our business and the business of our customers. For additional information, see Part I, Item1A, “Risk Factors—Regulatory and Legal Risks— Governmental laws and regulations may add to our costs, result in delays, or limit our drilling activity”.
The United Kingdom (“UK”) and countries in the European Union (“EU”) implemented an Emissions Trading Systems (“ETS”), and in July 2022, the Council of the EU adopted a proposal to revise the EU ETS Directive to include maritime transport activities; however, while negotiations are ongoing so the final text with the inclusion of shipping in the EU ETS has not yet been adopted and is subject to change, the expected results could have a material adverse effect on our business and the business of our customers.
The cost of compliance with the UK ETS and the EU ETS can be expected to increase over time. UK and additional EU member state climate change legislation may result in potentially material capital expenditures.
Combustion of ultra-low sulfur fuel oil aboard all of our vessels worldwide (Scope 1) is the Company’s primary source of GHG emissions, which includes carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Based upon the emissions calculation factor provided by the Environmental and Emissions Monitoring System (“EEMS”), for our vessels worldwide we estimate our carbon dioxide equivalent (“CO2e”) gas emissions for the year ended December 31, 2022 to be 597,706 tons and our operational intensity measure of tons of CO2e gas emissions per contract day for the year ended December 31, 2022 to be 94 tons per contract day.
In 2020, the scope of reporting of energy, GHG and other emissions changed from a financial scope to an operational scope.
Our Scope 1 CO2e gas emissions reporting has been prepared with reference to the UK Companies Act 2006 Regulations 2013, the Environmental Reporting Guidelines (June 2013) issued by the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs, the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard Revised and the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 14064-1, “Specification with guidance at the organizational level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals (2018).” 
Worker Safety. The US Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and other similar laws and regulations govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens. EU member states have also adopted regulations pursuant to EU Directive 2013/30/EU, on the safety of offshore oil and gas operations within the exclusive economic zone (which can extend up to 200 nautical miles from a coast) or the continental shelf. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements and EU directive 2013/30/EU (as well as the extensive current health and safety regimes implemented in the member states in which we operate), but future developments could require the Company to incur significant costs to comply with the directive's implementation.
International Regulatory Regime. The IMO provides international regulations governing shipping and international maritime trade. IMO regulations have been widely adopted by U.N. member countries, and in some jurisdictions in which we operate, these regulations have been expanded upon. The requirements contained in the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code, promulgated by the IMO, govern much of our drilling operations. Among other requirements, the ISM Code requires the party with operational control of a vessel to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies.
The IMO has also adopted and revised MARPOL, including Annex VI to MARPOL, which limits the main air pollutants contained in exhaust gas from ships, including sulfur oxides (“SOx”) and nitrous oxides (“NOx”), prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, regulates shipboard incineration and the emissions of volatile organic 
compounds from tankers, sets a progressive reduction globally in emissions of SOx, NOx and particulate matter, introduces emission control areas to reduce emissions of those air pollutants further in designated sea areas, and effective from January 1, 2020, reduces the global sulfur limit in fuel oil from the current 3.50% to 0.50% m/m (mass by mass) sulfur content. Prior to January 1, 2020, our rigs were operating and continue to operate with low sulfur fuel oil at or below the global limits of 0.50%. The IMO has also targeted greenhouse gas emissions in recent amendments to Annex VI. For example, as of January 1, 2023, Annex VI requires all ships to calculate an Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and establish an annual operational carbon intensity indicator (“CII”) and CII rating. Ships with low ratings over certain timeframes will be required to submit corrective action plans and improve their performance. The IMO is expected to continue implementing initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which could add to our costs or have an adverse impact on our operations.
The IMO has also negotiated international conventions that impose liability for oil pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatory to such conventions such as the Ballast Water Management Convention, (the “BWM Convention”) and the International Convention for Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage of 2001 (the “Bunker Convention”). The BWM Convention's implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast of water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with a requirement for mandatory ballast water treatment. The Bunker Convention provides a liability, compensation and compulsory insurance system for the victims of oil pollution damage caused by spills of bunker oil. We believe that all of our drilling rigs are currently compliant in all material respects with these regulations. However, the IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulation may have on our operations.
Insurance and Indemnification Matters
Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling business, including blowouts, fires, collisions, groundings, punch-throughs, and damage or loss from adverse weather and sea conditions. These hazards could cause personal injury or loss of life, loss of revenues, pollution and other environmental damage, damage to or destruction of property and equipment and oil and natural gas producing formations, and could result in claims by employees, customers or third parties and fines and penalties.
Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers and in most cases also require us to indemnify our customers for certain losses. Under our drilling contracts, liability with respect to personnel and property is typically assigned on a “knock-for-knock” basis, which means that we and our customers assume liability for our respective personnel and property, generally irrespective of the fault or negligence of the party indemnified. In addition, our customers may indemnify us in certain instances for damage to our down-hole equipment and, in some cases, our subsea equipment. Also, we generally obtain a mutual waiver of consequential losses in our drilling contracts. 
Our customers typically assume responsibility for and indemnify us from loss or liability resulting from pollution or contamination, including third-party damages and clean-up and removal, arising from operations under the contract and originating below the surface of the water. We are generally responsible for pollution originating above the surface of the water and emanating from our drilling units. Additionally, our customers typically indemnify us for liabilities incurred as a result of a blow-out or cratering of the well and underground reservoir loss or damage. In the current market, we are under increasing pressure to accept exceptions to the above-described allocations of risk and, as a result, take on more risk. In such cases where we agree, we generally limit the exposure with a monetary cap and other restrictions. 
In addition to the contractual indemnities described above, we also carry Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) and liability insurance, which comprises a comprehensive general liability insurance program covering liability resulting from offshore operations. Our liability insurance includes coverage for liability resulting from personal injury or death of third parties and our offshore employees, third-party property damage, pollution, spill clean-up and containment and removal of wrecks or debris. We also carry hull and machinery insurance that protects us against physical loss or damage to our drilling rigs. 
As of the closing of the Business Combination between Noble and Maersk Drilling on October 3, 2022, each company retained, except for certain corporate insurance policies, their respective legacy insurance programs with legacy Noble insurance covering legacy Noble assets and liabilities and legacy Maersk Drilling insurance covering legacy Maersk Drilling assets and liabilities. Noble is in the process of combining the two legacy programs into a single comprehensive, company wide insurance program.
The Noble legacy liability and hull and machinery insurance programs are renewed in April of each year, with the P&I program currently carrying a limit of $50.0 million per occurrence of which Noble retains the first $5.0 million per occurrence, plus excess liability coverage of $700.0 million in the aggregate. Our hull and machinery insurance is subject to 
a deductible that is currently $5.0 million, except with respect to loss or damage from named windstorms in the Gulf of Mexico, in which event the current deductible is $10.0 million. 
The legacy Maersk Drilling P&I and hull and machinery program is renewed in April and June respectively. The P&I program currently carries a limit of $200 million per occurrence ($500 million in the US Gulf of Mexico) of which the legacy Maersk Drilling group retains de minimis levels per occurrence outside the US Gulf of Mexico and a $0.5 million retention inside the US Gulf of Mexico. This program also includes excess liability coverage, which provides a total of $900 million in the aggregate. The legacy Maersk Drilling hull and machinery insurance is subject to a deductible of $7.5 million.
Our insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover our losses and liabilities in all cases. For additional information, please read Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We may have difficulty obtaining or maintaining insurance in the future and our insurance coverage and contractual indemnity rights may not protect us against all the risks and hazards we face.”
The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts is only a summary as of the time of preparation of this report and is general in nature. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling contracts may change in the future. In addition, the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and enforcement of those provisions may be limited by public policy and other considerations.
