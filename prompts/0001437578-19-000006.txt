Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are a leading provider of high-quality child care and early education, back-up care and educational advisory services designed to help employers and families better address the challenges of work and family life. We provide services primarily under multi-year contracts with employers who offer child care, as well as other dependent care solutions and educational advisory services, as part of their employee benefits packages to improve employee engagement, productivity, recruitment and retention. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 1,100 client relationships with employers across a diverse array of industries, including more than 150 Fortune 500 companies and more than 80 of Working Mother magazine’s 2018 “100 Best Companies.” Our service offerings include:

• | full service center-based child care and early education (representing approximately 83% of our 2018 revenue);


• | back-up care (representing approximately 13% of our 2018 revenue); and


• | educational advisory services (representing approximately 4% of our 2018 revenue).

As of December 31, 2018, we operated a total of 1,082 child care and early education centers across a wide range of customer industries with the capacity to serve approximately 120,000 children and their families in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada and India. We have consistently achieved satisfaction ratings of approximately 98% among respondents in our employer and parent satisfaction surveys and maintained an annual client retention rate of approximately 95% for employer-sponsored centers over each of the past ten years.
Our History
Since 1986, we have operated child care and early education centers for employers and working families. In 1998, we transformed our business through the merger of Bright Horizons, Inc. and Corporate Family Solutions, Inc., both then Nasdaq-listed companies that were founded in 1986 and 1987, respectively. We were listed on Nasdaq from 1998 to May 2008 when we were acquired by investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners LLC (referred to as our “going private transaction”). On January 30, 2013, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) and our common stock became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “BFAM.”
Throughout our history, we have continued to grow while investing in our future. We have grown our international footprint to become a leading provider in the center-based child care market in the United Kingdom and have expanded into the Netherlands, Canada and India as a platform for further international expansion. In the United States, we have grown our partnerships with employer clients by expanding and enhancing our back-up care services and by developing and growing our educational advisory services. We have and continue to invest in new technologies to better support our full suite of services as well as enhance our customers’ user experience, and we have expanded our marketing efforts with additional focus on driving use of our services and maximizing occupancy levels in centers where we can improve our economics with increased enrollment.
Industry Overview
We compete in the global market for child care and early education services as well as the market for work/life services offered by employers as benefits to their employees. The child care industry can generally be subdivided into center-based and home-based child care. We operate primarily in the center-based market, which is highly fragmented.
The center-based child care market includes both retail and employer-sponsored centers and can be further divided into full-service centers and back-up centers. The employer-sponsored model has always been central to our business and is characterized by a single employer or consortium of employers entering into a long-term contract for the provision of child care at a center located at or near the employer sponsor’s worksite. The employer sponsor generally funds the development as well as ongoing maintenance and repair of a child care center and subsidizes the provision of child care services to make them more affordable for its employees.
Additionally, we compete in the growing markets for back-up care and educational advisory services, and we believe we are the largest and one of the only multi-national providers of back-up care services.
Industry Trends
We believe that the following key factors contribute to growth in the markets for employer-sponsored child care and for back-up care and educational advisory services.
5

Increasing Participation by Women and Two Working Parent Families in the Workforce.  A significant percentage of mothers currently participate in the workforce. In 2017, 62% of mothers with children under the age of 6 participated in the workforce in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2017, women earned 53% of all doctorate degrees and 57% of master’s degrees in the United States, according to a 2018 report by the Council of Graduate Schools. We expect that the number of working mothers and two working parent families will continue to increase over time, resulting in an increase in the need for child care and other work/life services.
Greater Demand for High-Quality Center-Based Child Care and Early Education.  We believe that recognition of the importance of early education and consistent quality child care has led to increased demand for higher-quality center-based care and education. In 2007, the number of children aged 3 years to 6 years enrolled in center-based child care was 55%, compared to approximately 60% of such children in 2016, according to data gathered by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics.
With the shift towards center-based care, there is an increased focus on the establishment of objective, standards-based methods of defining and measuring the quality of child care, such as accreditation. In a highly fragmented market comprised largely of center operators lacking scale, we believe this trend will favor larger industry participants with the size and capital resources to achieve quality standards on a consistent basis.
Recognized Return on Investment to Employers.  Based on studies we have conducted through our workforce consulting practice, we believe that employer sponsors of center-based child care and back-up care services realize strong returns on their investments in terms of reduced turnover and increased productivity. We estimate that users of our back-up care services have been able to work, on average, six days annually that they otherwise would have missed due to breakdowns in child care arrangements. Additionally, according to a 2018 survey of our clients, 98% of respondents reported that access to back-up care helps their employees be more productive. We believe that this return on investment for employers will result in additional growth in employer-sponsored center-based child care and back-up care services.
Growing Global Demand for Child Care and Early Education Services.  We expect that a long-term shift to service-based economies and an increasing emphasis on education and child care by government and families will contribute to further growth in the global child care and early education market as well as the developing markets for back-up care and educational advisory services. In addition, in certain countries in which we operate, public policy decisions have facilitated increased demand for child care and early education services. For example, in 2017, the United Kingdom increased the child care subsidy for 3 and 4 year olds from 15 hours per week to 30 hours per week, and the Netherlands increased the maximum hourly subsidy for future years ahead of cost of living increases. Both actions represent efforts to make child care more affordable for working families and thereby encourage parents to return and remain in the workforce.
Evolving Workforce.  Employers are facing potentially significant labor shortages and skills gaps as roughly 3.5 million baby boomers per year are now reaching retirement age of 65. We believe there is a renewed focus on the importance of recruiting and retention, as well as the continued education and training of the existing workforce, including the alignment of learning and development goals with tuition reimbursement and student loan repayment programs. In addition, the evolution of the composition of the global workforce is contributing to a change in employee perception of compensation and benefits, particularly with an increase in the value of workplace flexibility and work-life balance. We believe these growing needs and changing trends will encourage employers to invest in full service center-based child care, back-up care and educational advisory services as a means to bolster employee engagement, recruitment and retention.
Our Competitive Strengths
Market Leading Service Provider
We believe we are the leader in the markets for employer-sponsored center-based child care and back-up care, and that the breadth, depth and quality of our service offerings—developed over a successful 30-year history—represent significant competitive advantages. We estimate that we have approximately six times more employer-sponsored centers in the United States than our closest competitor, according to data obtained from the Child Care Information Exchange’s 2018 Employer Child Care Trend Report on center-based providers. We believe the broad geographic reach of our child care centers, with targeted clusters in areas where we believe demand is generally higher and where income demographics are attractive, provides us with a competitive platform to market our services to new and existing clients.
Collaborative, Long-term Relationships with Diverse Customer Base
We have more than 1,100 client relationships with employers across a diverse array of industries, including more than 150 of the Fortune 500 companies. Our largest client contributes less than 2% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 and our largest 10 clients represented approximately 8% of our revenue in the same year. Our business model emphasizes multi-year employer sponsorship contracts where our clients typically fund the development of new child care centers at or near their worksites and frequently support the ongoing operations of these centers.
6

Our multiple service points with both employers and employees give us unique insight into the corporate culture of our clients and enables us to identify and provide innovative and tailored solutions to address our clients’ specific work/life needs. In addition to full service center-based child care, we provide access to a multi-national back-up care network and educational advisory support, allowing us to offer various combinations of services to best meet the needs of specific clients or specific locations for a single client. We believe our tailored, collaborative approach to employer-sponsored child care has contributed to an annual client retention rate for employer-sponsored centers of approximately 95% over each of the past ten years.
Commitment to Quality
Our business is anchored in our commitment to consistently provide high-quality service offerings to employers and families. We have designed our child care centers to meet or exceed applicable accreditation and rating standards in all of our key markets, including standards set in the United States by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs, a division of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), and in the United Kingdom by the Office of Standards in Education (OFSTED). We believe our commitment to achieving accreditation standards offers a competitive advantage in securing employer sponsorship opportunities and in attracting and retaining families as an increasing number of potential and existing employer clients require adherence to accreditation criteria.
We maintain our proprietary curriculum at the forefront of early education practices by introducing elements that respond to the changing expectations and views of society and new information and theories about the ways in which children learn and grow. We also believe that strong adult-to-child ratios are a critical factor in delivering our curriculum effectively as well as helping to facilitate more focused care. Our programs provide adult-to-child ratios that meet or exceed state licensing standards.
Market Leading People Practices
Our ability to deliver consistently high-quality care, education and other services is directly related to our ability to attract, retain and motivate our highly skilled workforce. We have consistently been named as a top employer by third-party sources in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, including being named as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” by Fortune Magazine 18 times, as well as a great place to work in the United Kingdom and in the Netherlands by the Great Place to Work Institute. We have also been named one of the “Top Places to Work” by the Boston Globe 11 times.
We believe the education and experience of our center leaders and teachers exceed the industry average. In addition to ongoing in-center training, we have an in-house online training academy that allows our employees to earn nationally-recognized child development credentials. In 2018, we also launched the Teacher Degree Program, an expanded tuition reimbursement program, whereby our teachers are able to earn associate and bachelor’s degrees in early childhood education at no cost to the employee. We believe this program is unique in our industry, and will continue to distinguish us as an employer of choice.
Capital Efficient Operating Model Provides Platform for Growth with Attractive Economics
We have achieved uninterrupted year-over-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for more than 15 years despite broader macro-economic fluctuations. With employer sponsors funding the majority of the capital required for new centers developed on their behalf, we have been able to grow our business with limited capital investment, which has contributed to strong cash flows from operations.
Proven Acquisition Track Record
We have an established acquisition team to pursue potential targets using a proven framework to effectively evaluate potential transactions with the goal of maximizing our return on investment while minimizing risk. Over the last ten fiscal years we have completed the acquisition of 434 child care centers in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as providers of back-up care services and educational advisory services in the United States.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe that there are significant opportunities to continue to grow our business globally and expand our leadership position by continuing to execute on the following strategies.
Grow Our Client Relationships

• | Secure Relationships with New Employer Clients. Our addressable market includes approximately 13,000 employers, each with at least 1,000 employees, within the industries that we currently serve in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our dedicated sales force focuses on establishing new client relationships and is supported by our workforce consulting practice, which helps potential clients to identify the precise work/life offerings that will best meet their strategic goals. 

7


• | Cross-Sell and Expand Services to Existing Employer Clients. We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase the number of our clients that use more than one of our services, and to expand the services we provide to existing clients. Over the past five years, we have doubled the number of our clients who utilize more than one of our services to 260 clients as of December 31, 2018. 


• | Continue to Expand Through the Assumption of Management of Existing Sponsored Child Care Centers. We occasionally assume the management of existing centers from the incumbent management, which enables us to develop new client relationships, typically with no capital investment and no purchase price payment. 

Sustain Annual Price Increases to Enable Continued Investments in Quality
We look for opportunities to invest in quality as a way to enhance our reputation with our clients and their employees.  By developing a strong reputation for high-quality services and facilities, we have been able to support consistent price increases that have kept pace with our cost increases. Over our history, these price increases have contributed to our revenue growth and have enabled us to drive margin expansion.
Increase Utilization at Existing Centers and Use of Back-up Care and Educational Advisory Services
In addition to continuing to increase enrollment levels in our more recently opened profit and loss centers, we also look for opportunities to maximize enrollment at our mature profit and loss centers (centers that have been open for more than three years, as more fully described below) in order to achieve continued growth and improved center economics. We also look for opportunities to increase the use of our back-up care and educational advisory services, not only by growing client relationships, but also by driving use at existing clients.
Selectively Add New Lease/Consortium Centers and Expand Through Acquisitions
We have typically added approximately fifteen new lease/consortium centers (as more fully described below) annually for the past five years, focusing on urban or city surrounding markets where demand is generally higher and where income demographics are generally more supportive of a new center. In addition, we have a long track record of successfully completing and integrating selective acquisitions. The domestic and international markets for child care and other family support services remain highly fragmented and we will continue to seek attractive opportunities both for center acquisitions and the acquisition of complementary service offerings.
Our Operations
Our operating and reporting segments are comprised of full-service center-based child care, back-up care, and educational advisory services. Full-service center-based child care includes traditional center-based child care, preschool and elementary education. Back-up care includes center-based back-up child care, and in-home care for children and adult/elder dependents. Educational advisory services primarily consist of tuition reimbursement program management, student loan repayment, related educational advising, and college advisory services. The following table sets forth our segment information for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands, except percentages):

 | Full ServiceCenter-BasedChild Care | | Back-upCare | | EducationalAdvisory Services | | Total
Revenue | $ | 1,586,323 | | | $ | 245,498 | | | $ | 71,361 | | $ | 1,903,182
As a percentage of total revenue | 83 | % | | 13 | % | | 4 | % | | 100 | %
Income from operations | $ | 152,006 | | | $ | 68,462 | | | $ | 18,627 | | $ | 239,095 
As a percentage of total income from operations | 64 | % | | 28 | % | | 8 | % | | 100 | %

Additional segment information is included in Note 15, “Segment and Geographic Information,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Full-Service Center-Based Child Care Services
We operate our centers under two principal business models: (1) a cost-plus model, where we are paid a fee by an employer client for managing a child care center on a cost-plus basis; and (2) a profit and loss (“P&L”) model, where we assume the financial risk of operating a child care center. The P&L model is further classified into two subcategories:

• | a sponsor model, where we provide child care and early education services on either an exclusive or priority enrollment basis for the employees of an employer sponsor; and


• | a lease/consortium model, where we provide child care and early education services to the employees of multiple employers located within a real estate development (for example, an office building or office park), as well as to families in the surrounding community. 

8

In both our cost-plus and sponsor P&L models, the development of a new child care center, as well as ongoing maintenance and repair, is typically funded by an employer sponsor with whom we enter into a multi-year contractual relationship. In addition, employer sponsors typically provide subsidies for the ongoing provision of child care services for their employees.
Our full-service center operations are led by a Senior Vice President and are organized into geographic divisions. Each division is further divided into regions, each supervised by a Regional Manager who oversees the operational performance of approximately six to eight centers and is responsible for supervising the program quality, financial performance and client relationships. A typical center is managed by a small administrative team under the leadership of a Center Director. A Center Director has day-to-day operating responsibility for the center, including training, management of the business and staff, licensing compliance, implementation of curricula, conducting child assessments and enrollment. Our corporate offices provide centralized administrative support for accounting, finance, information systems, legal, payroll, risk management, marketing and human resources functions. We follow this underlying operational structure for center operations in each country in which we operate.
Center hours of operation are designed to match the schedules of employer sponsors and working families. Most of our centers are open 10 to 12 hours a day, Monday through Friday, and we offer a variety of enrollment options, ranging from full-time to part-time scheduling.
Tuition paid by families varies depending on the age of the child, the child’s attendance schedule, the geographic location and the extent to which an employer sponsor subsidizes tuition. Based on a sample of 360 of our child care and early education centers in the United States, the current average tuition rates at our centers are $1,970 per month for infants (typically ages 3 to 16 months), $1,765 per month for toddlers (typically ages 16 months to 3 years) and $1,410 per month for preschoolers (typically ages 3 to 5 years). Tuition at most of our child care and early education centers is payable in advance and is due either monthly or weekly. In most cases, families pay tuition through payroll deductions or through Automated Clearing House withdrawals.
Revenue per center typically averages between $1.5 million and $2.0 million at our centers in North America, and averages between $1.2 million and $1.3 million at our centers in Europe, primarily due to the larger average size of our centers in North America. Gross margin at our centers typically averages between 20% and 25%, with our cost-plus model centers typically at the lower end of that range and our lease/consortium centers at the higher end.
Cost of services consists of direct expenses associated with the operation of child care and early education centers primarily comprised of payroll and benefits for personnel, food costs, program supplies and materials, parent marketing and facilities costs, which include depreciation. Personnel costs are the largest component of a center’s operating costs and comprise approximately 70% of a center’s operating expenses. In a P&L model center, we are often responsible for additional costs that are typically paid or provided directly by a client in centers operating under the cost-plus model, such as facilities costs. As a result, personnel costs in centers operating under P&L models will often represent a smaller percentage of overall costs when compared to centers operating under cost-plus models.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SGA”) relating to full-service center-based child care consist primarily of salaries, payroll taxes and benefits (including stock-based compensation costs) for non-center personnel, which includes corporate, regional and business development personnel, accounting and legal, information technology, occupancy costs for corporate and regional personnel, management/advisory fees and other general corporate expenses.
Back-up care Services
We provide back-up care services through our full-service centers, dedicated back-up centers, in-home care providers, and back-up care network. Back-up care offers access to a contracted network of approximately 3,000 in-home care agencies and center-based providers in locations where we do not otherwise have in-home care providers or centers with available capacity.
Our back-up care division is led by a Senior Vice President. The dedicated back-up centers that we operate are organized in a similar structure to full-service centers, with Regional Managers overseeing approximately six to eight centers each and with center-based administrative teams that mirror the administrative teams in full-service centers. The dedicated back-up centers are either exclusive to a single employer or are consortium centers that have multiple employer sponsors and are part of our back-up care program.
Care is arranged through a 24 hours-a-day contact center, online or via our mobile application, allowing employees to reserve care in advance or at the last minute. We operate our own contact center in Broomfield, Colorado and we contract with additional contact centers located in North Carolina and Missouri to complement our ability to handle demand fluctuations, provide business continuity, and deliver seamless service 24 hours a day.

Back-up care revenue is comprised of fees or subsidies paid by employer sponsors, as well as co-payments collected from users. Cost of services consist of fees paid to providers for care delivered as part of their contractual relationships with us, personnel and related direct service costs of the contact centers and any other expenses related to the coordination or delivery of care and service. For our dedicated back-up centers, cost of services also includes all direct expenses associated with the operation of the centers. SGA related to back-up care is similar to SGA for full-service center-based child care, with additional expenses related to the information technology necessary to operate this service, the ongoing development and maintenance of the provider network, and additional personnel needed as a result of more significant client management and reporting requirements.
Educational Advisory Services
Our educational advisory services consist of our EdAssist Solutions and Education and College Advising (also known as College Coach) services. Educational advisory services revenue is comprised of fees paid by employer clients, as well as retail fees collected from users at the point of service. Cost of services consist of personnel and direct service costs of the contact centers, and other expenses related to the coordination and delivery of tuition reimbursement program management, student loan repayment, advisory and counseling services. SGA related to educational advisory services is similar to SGA for back-up care. The educational advisory services segment is managed by a Senior Vice President who has responsibility for the growth and profitability of this division.
EdAssist Solutions.  EdAssist Solutions provides tuition reimbursement program management services and student loan repayment services for corporate clients. Administration services are provided through a proprietary software system for processing and data analytics, as well as a team of compliance professionals who audit and process employee’s applications for tuition reimbursement or student loan repayment and enforce the employer client’s policies. We also provide educational advising to client employees on a one-on-one basis through our team of advisors, who help employees make better decisions regarding their education and financial wellness. Customer service is also provided through the contact center in Broomfield, Colorado. The EdAssist Solutions services derive revenue directly from fees paid by employers under contracts that are typically three years in length.
Education and College Advising (also known as College Coach).  Education and College Advising provides college admissions and college financing advisory services through our team of experts, all of whom have experience working at senior levels in admissions or financial aid at colleges and universities. We work with employer clients who offer these services as a benefit to their employees, and we also provide these services directly to families on a retail basis through our College Coach brand. We have various College Coach offices across the United States, located primarily in metropolitan areas, where we believe the demand for these services is greatest. Education and College Advising derives revenue mainly from employer clients who contract with us for a specified number of workshops, access to our proprietary online learning center and individual counseling.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations. Demand for child care and early education and elementary school services has historically decreased during the summer months when school is not in session, at which time families are often on vacation or have alternative child care arrangements. In addition, our enrollment declines as older children transition to elementary schools. Demand for our services generally increases in September and October coinciding with the beginning of the new school year and remains relatively stable throughout the rest of the school year. In addition, use of our back-up care services tends to be higher when schools are not in session and during holiday periods, which can increase the operating costs of the program and impact the results of operations. Our educational advisory services have limited seasonal fluctuations. Results of operations may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of, among other things, the performance of existing centers, including enrollment and staffing fluctuations, the number and timing of new center openings, acquisitions and management transitions, the timing of new client launches in our back-up and educational advisory services, the length of time required for new centers to achieve profitability, center closings, refurbishment or relocation, the contract model mix (P&L versus cost-plus) of new and existing centers, the timing and level of sponsorship payments, competitive factors and general economic conditions.

Geography
We operate in two primary regions: North America, which includes the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, and Europe, which we define to include the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and India. The following table sets forth information by geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands, except percentages):

 | North America | | Europe | | Total
Revenue | $ | 1,455,349 | | | $ | 447,833 | | | $ | 1,903,182
As a percentage of total revenue | 76 | % | | 24 | % | | 100 | %
Long-lived assets, net | $ | 347,715 | | | $ | 249,426 | | | $ | 597,141 
As a percentage of total fixed assets, net | 58 | % | | 42 | % | | 100 | %

Our international business primarily consists of child care centers throughout the United Kingdom and the Netherlands and is overseen by a Managing Director. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 374 centers in Europe and 708 centers in North America. Additional geographical information is included in Note 15, “Segment and Geographic Information,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Marketing
We market our services to prospective employer sponsors, current clients and their employees, and to parents. Our sales force is organized on both a centralized and regional basis and is responsible for identifying potential employer sponsors, and managing the overall sales process. We reach out to employers via word of mouth, direct mail campaigns, digital outreach and advertising, conference networking, webinars and social media. In addition, many employer sponsors promote our child care and early education centers as an important employee benefit and we communicate regularly with existing clients to increase awareness of the full suite of services that we provide for key life stages and to explore opportunities to enhance current partnerships. We work closely with clients to execute coordinated employee engagement plans that include targeted email, webinars, on-site events, and more to drive awareness and utilization of the Bright Horizons benefits within their workforces.
As a result of our visibility among human resources professionals as a high-quality dependent care service provider, potential employer sponsors regularly contact us requesting proposals, and we often compete for employer-sponsorship opportunities through a request for proposal process. Our management team is involved at the national level with education, work/life and children’s advocacy, and we believe that their prominence and involvement in such issues also helps attract new business.
We also have a direct-to-consumer (parent) marketing department that supports parent enrollment efforts through the development of marketing programs, including the preparation of promotional materials. The parent marketing team is organized on both a centralized and regional basis and works with center directors and our contact centers to build enrollment. New enrollment is generated by word of mouth, targeted digital marketing, parent referral programs, print advertising, direct mail campaigns, and business outreach. Individual centers may receive assistance from employer sponsors, who often provide access to channels of internal communication, such as e-mail, websites, intranets, mailing lists and internal publications. We have expanded our marketing efforts with additional focus on maximizing occupancy levels in centers where we can improve our economics with increased enrollment. We continue to invest in expanded digital marketing capabilities to personalize communication with our users, which over time is expected to drive increased utilization within the workforce of the employer clients and parents we serve.
Competition
We believe that we are a leading provider in the markets for employer-sponsored center-based child care and back-up care. We estimate that we have approximately six times more market share in the United States than our closest competitors who provide employer-sponsored center-based child care. The market for child care and early education services is highly fragmented, and we compete for enrollment and for sponsorship of child care and early education centers with a variety of other businesses including large community-based child care companies, regional child care providers, family day care (operated out of the caregiver’s home), nannies, for-profit and not-for-profit full- and part-time nursery schools, private schools and public elementary schools, and not-for-profit and government-funded providers of center-based child care. Our principal competitors for employer-sponsored centers include KinderCare Education and New Horizons Academy in the United States and Childbase and Busy Bees in the United Kingdom. Competition for back-up care and educational advising comes from some of these same competitors in addition to employee assistance programs and smaller work/life companies. We compete for enrollment on a center-by-center basis with some of the providers named above, along with many local and national providers, such as Learning Care Group, Goddard Schools, Primrose Preschools, Little Pioneers, KidsFoundation, and Partou in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
11

We believe that the key factors in the competition for enrollment are quality of care, site convenience and cost. We believe that many center-based child care providers are able to offer care at lower prices than we do by utilizing less intensive adult-to-child ratios and offering their staff lower compensation and limited or less affordable benefits. While our tuition levels are generally higher than our competitors, we compete primarily based on the convenience of a work-site location and a higher level of program quality. In addition, many of our competitors may have access to greater financial resources (such as access to government funding or other subsidies), or may benefit from broader name recognition (such as established regional providers) or comply, or are required to comply, with fewer or less costly health, safety, and operational regulations than those with which we comply (such as the more limited health, safety and operational regulatory requirements typically applicable to family day care operations in caregivers’ homes). We believe that our primary focus on employer clients and track record for achieving and maintaining high-quality standards distinguishes us from our competitors.
We have and continue to invest in technology to better support our full suite of services, enhance our customers’ user experience, to build utilization levels of our services within our client workforces and across our existing client base, and to deliver more efficient and automated support services. Investments to integrate our web and mobile functionality across all of our services as well as expand mobile capabilities are designed to ensure that our key systems deliver the value we expect and provide us with the platform to grow our position in the market. We believe we are well-positioned to continue attracting new employer sponsors due to our extensive service offerings, established reputation, position as a quality leader and track record of serving major employer sponsors for more than 30 years.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our name and logo have significant value and are important to our operations. We own and use various registered and unregistered trademarks covering the names Bright Horizons and Bright Horizons Family Solutions, our logo and a number of other names, slogans and designs. We frequently license the use of our registered trademarks to our clients in connection with the use of our services, subject to customary restrictions. We actively protect our trademarks by registering the marks in a variety of countries and geographic areas, including North America, Asia, Europe, India, Australia and New Zealand. These registrations are subject to varying terms and renewal options. However, not all of the trademarks or service marks have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and we are aware of persons using similar marks in certain countries in which we currently do not do business. Meanwhile, we monitor our trademarks and vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our registered marks as appropriate. We do not hold any patents, and we hold copyright registrations for certain materials that are important to the operation of our business. We generally rely on common law protection for those copyrighted works which are not critical to the operation of our business. We also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our business. Such licenses are not individually or in the aggregate material to our business.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of our business, including various licensing, health, fire and safety requirements and standards.  In most jurisdictions in which we operate, our child care centers are required by law to meet a variety of operational requirements, including minimum qualifications and background checks for our teachers and other center personnel.  State and local regulations may also impact the design and furnishing of our centers.
Internationally, we are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting us in the United States, including laws and regulations concerning various licensing, health, fire and safety requirements and standards. We believe that our centers comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations in these countries.
Health and Safety
The safety and well-being of children and our employees is paramount for us. We employ a variety of security measures at our child care and early education centers, which typically include secure electronic access systems as well as sign-in and sign-out procedures for children, among other site-specific security measures. In addition, our trained teachers and open center designs help ensure the health and safety of children. Our child care and early education centers are designed to minimize the risk of injury to children by incorporating such features as child-sized amenities, rounded corners on furniture and fixtures, age-appropriate toys and equipment and cushioned fall zones surrounding play structures.
Each center is further guided by policies and procedures that address protocols for safe and appropriate care of children and center administration. These policies and procedures establish center protocols in areas including the safe handling of medications, managing child illness or health emergencies and a variety of other critical aspects of care to ensure that centers meet or exceed all mandated licensing standards. These policies and procedures are reviewed and updated continuously by a team of internal experts and center personnel are trained on center practices using these policies and procedures. Our proprietary We Care system supports proper supervision of children and documents the transitions of children to and from the care of teachers and parents or from one classroom to another during the day.

Environmental
Our operations, including the selection and development of the properties that we lease and any construction or improvements that we make at those locations, are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including environmental, zoning and land use requirements. In addition, we have a practice of conducting site evaluations on each freestanding or newly constructed or renovated property that we own or lease. Although we have no known material environmental liabilities, environmental laws may require owners or operators of contaminated property to remediate that property, regardless of fault.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 33,350 global employees (including part-time and substitute teachers), of whom approximately 2,300 were employed at our corporate, divisional and regional offices, and the remainder of whom were employed at our child care and early education centers. Child care and early education center employees include teachers and support personnel. The total number of employees includes approximately 11,650 employees working outside of the United States. We conduct annual surveys to assess employee engagement and overall well-being, and can adjust programs, benefits offerings, trainings, communications and other support to meet employee needs and enhance retention. We continue to make investments in our employees and most recently added the Teacher Degree Program in 2018. This program is designed to enable the teachers in our child care centers to earn associates and bachelor’s degrees in early childhood education at no cost to the employee. We have a long track record of being named a “Best Place to Work” by Fortune Magazine in the United States and as a great place to work in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands by the Great Place to Work Institute based largely upon employee responses to surveys. One child care center in the United States, comprised of approximately 30 employees, is represented by a labor union. We believe we have a good relationship with the labor union, its representatives and these employees. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.
Facilities
Our child care and early education centers are primarily operated at work-site locations and vary in design and capacity in accordance with employer sponsor needs and state and local regulatory requirements. Our North American child care and early education centers typically have an average capacity of 126 children. Our locations in Europe have an average capacity of 81 children. As of December 31, 2018, our child care and early education centers had a total licensed capacity of approximately 120,000 children, with the smallest center having a capacity of 12 children and the largest having a capacity of approximately 511 children.
We believe that attractive, spacious and child-friendly facilities with warm, nurturing and welcoming atmospheres are an important element in fostering a high-quality learning environment for children. Our centers are designed to be open and bright and to maximize supervision visibility. We devote considerable resources to equipping our centers with child-sized amenities, indoor and outdoor play areas comprised of age-appropriate materials and design, family hospitality areas and computer centers. Commercial kitchens are typically only present in those centers where regulations require that hot meals be prepared on site.
