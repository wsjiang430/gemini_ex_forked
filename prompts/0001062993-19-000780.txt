ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
We are a biotechnology company specializing in the development, manufacturing and provision of technologies and services in the cell and gene therapy industry. We operate through two platforms: (i) a point-of-care (“POCare”) cell therapy platform (“PT”) and (ii) a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (“CDMO”) platform conducted through our subsidiary, Masthercell Global. Through our PT business, our aim is to further the development of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (“ATMPs”) through collaborations and in-licensing with other pre-clinical and clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies and research and healthcare institutes to bring such ATMPs to patients. We out-license these ATMPs through regional partners to whom we also provide regulatory, pre-clinical and training services to support their activity in order to reach patients in a point-of-care hospital setting. Through our CDMO platform, we are focused on providing contract manufacturing and development services for biopharmaceutical companies.
 
Activities in our PT business include a multitude of cell therapies, including autoimmune, oncologic, neurologic and metabolic diseases and other indications. We provide services for our joint venture (“JV”) partners, pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as research institutions and hospitals that have cell therapies in clinical development. Each of these customers and collaborations represents a revenue and growth opportunity upon regulatory approval. Furthermore, our trans-differentiation technology demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver or other tissues and transdifferentiating them into “pancreatic beta cell-like” Autologous Insulin Producing (“AIP”) cells for patients with Type 1 Diabetes, acute pancreatitis and other insulin deficient diseases. This technology, which has yet to be proven in human clinical trials, has shown in pre-clinical animal models that the human derived AIP cells produce insulin in a glucose-sensitive manner. This trans-differentiation technology is licensed by our Israeli Subsidiary and is based on the work of Prof. Sarah Ferber, our Chief Scientific Officer and a researcher at Tel Hashomer Medical Research Infrastructure and Services Ltd. (“THM”) in Israel. Our development plan calls for conducting additional pre-clinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to diabetes and other potential indications prior to initiating human clinical trials. With respect to this trans-differentiation technology, we own or have exclusive rights to ten (10) United States and nineteen (19) foreign issued patents, nine (9) pending applications in the United States, thirty-two (32) pending applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Singapore, and four (4) international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications. These patents and applications relate, among others, to (1) the trans-differentiation of cells (including hepatic cells) to cells having pancreatic β-cell-like phenotype and function and to their use in the treatment of degenerative pancreatic disorders, including diabetes, pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis, and (2) scaffolds, including alginate and sulfated alginate scaffolds, polysaccharides thereof, and scaffolds for use for cell propagation, transdifferentiation, and transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including diabetes.

Our CDMO platform operates through Masthercell Global, which currently consists of the following subsidiaries: MaSTherCell in Belgium, Atvio in Israel and CureCell in South Korea and Masthercell U.S., LLC in the United States, each having unique know-how and expertise for manufacturing in a multitude of cell types. As part of our United States (“U.S.”) activity, we intend to also set up a CDMO facility in the United States. We believe that, in-order to provide the optimal service to our customers, we need to have a global presence. We target the international market as a key priority through our network of facilities that provide development, manufacturing and logistics services, utilizing our advanced quality management system and experienced staff. All of these capabilities offered to third-parties are utilized for our internal development projects, with the goal of allowing us to be able to bring new products to patients faster and in a more cost-effective way. Masthercell Global strives to provide services that are all compliant with Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements, ensuring identity, purity, stability, potency and robustness of cell therapy products for clinical phase I, II, III and through commercialization.
 
We operate our CDMO and the PT platforms as two separate business segments.
 
Overview for Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs)
 
Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (“ATMP”) means any of the following medicinal products for human use:
 

· | a somatic cell therapy medicinal product (“STMP”);
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | a tissue engineered product (“TEP”);
--+-------------------------------------


· | a gene therapy medicinal product (“GTMP”); or
--+----------------------------------------------


· | a combined ATMP.
--+-----------------

 
An STMP contains cells or tissues that have been manipulated to change their biological characteristics or cells or tissues not intended to be used for the same essential functions in the body. A TEP contains cells or tissues that have been modified so they can be used to repair, regenerate or replace human tissue. A GTMP contains genes that lead to a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect and work by inserting “recombinant” genes into the body, usually to treat a variety of diseases, including genetic disorders, cancer or long-term diseases. A recombinant gene is a stretch of DNA that is created in the laboratory, bringing together DNA from different sources. Combined ATMPs contain one or more medical devices as an integral part of the medicine, such as cells embedded in a biodegradable matrix or scaffold. Although STMPs and GTMPs currently dominate the market, in order to access the market potential and trends in the future, other cell products are likely to be essential in all these categories.
 
Furthermore, we believe that autologous therapies will be a substantial segment of the ATMP market. Autologous therapies are produced from a patients’ own cells, instead of mass-cultivated donor-cells, or allogeneic cells. Allogeneic therapies are derived from donor cells and, through the construction of master and working cell banks, are produced on a large scale. Autologous therapies are derived from the treated patient and manufactured through a defined protocol before re-administration and generally demand a more complex supply chain. Currently with the ATMP network relying heavily on production and supply chain of manufacturing sites, we believe our POCare model may help overcome some of the development and supply challenges with bringing these therapies to patients.

CDMO Business
 
Companies developing cell therapies need to make a decision early on in their approach to the transition from the lab to the clinic regarding the process development and manufacturing of the cells necessary for their respective therapeutic treatments. Of the companies active in this market, only a small number have developed their own GMP manufacturing facilities due to the high costs and expertise required to develop these processes. In addition to the limitations imposed by a limited number of trained personnel and high infrastructure/operational costs, the industry faces a need for custom innovative process development and manufacturing solutions. Due to the complexity and diversity of the industry, such solutions are often customized to the particular needs of a company and, accordingly, a multidisciplinary team of engineers, cell therapy experts, cGMP and regulatory experts is required. Such a unique group of experts can exist only in an organization that both specializes in developing characterization assays and solutions and manufactures cell therapies.
 
Companies can establish their own process and GMP manufacturing facility or engage a contract manufacturing organization for each step. A CDMO is an entity that serves other companies in the pharmaceutical industry on a contract basis to provide comprehensive services from cell therapy development through cell therapy manufacturing for and end-to-end solution. Due to the complexity, global outreach needs, redundancy and operational costs of manufacturing biologics and cell therapies, the CDMO business is expanding. With more than 861 companies in the field of cell therapy worldwide (versus 580 in 2015) and 959 clinical trials underway by the end of the first quarter of 2018 (versus 486 in first quarter of 2015), we believe that the industry shows a rapid growth rate accompanied by a lack of sufficient GMP manufacturing capacities (Source: Informa, 2015 and 2018). Over recent years, advances in the field of cell therapy, including the growth of autologous CAR T-cell therapies, led to a significant increase in investment in the industry. T-cells, the backbone of CAR T-cell therapy, are often called the workhorses of the immune system because of their critical role in orchestrating the immune response and killing cells infected by pathogens. The therapy requires drawing blood from patients and separating out the T-cells. Next, using a disarmed virus, the T-cells are genetically engineered to produce receptors on their surface called Chimeric Antigen Receptors, or CARs. The genetically modified T-cells that are re-injected into the patient are then much more effective at targeting and killing tumors.
 
Two landmark U.S. Food Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approvals in CAR T-cell therapy significantly impacted the cell therapy industry. In August 2017, Novartis’s CAR T-cell therapy, Kymriah, was approved for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia for pediatric and young adult patients, making it the first cell-base immunotherapy to move across the finish line in the United States. Kymriah received a second FDA approval to treat appropriate relapsed/refractory patients with large B-cell lymphoma in May 2018. Europe has also followed this path as, in August 2018, the European Commission approved Kymriah based on the first global CAR-T registration trials, which included patients from eight European countries and demonstrated durable responses and a consistent safety profile in relapsed/refractory pediatric B-cell ALL and r/r DLBCL. Furthermore, after Gilead's acquisition of Kite Pharma, Inc. for $12 billion in 2017, Kite Pharma’s CAR T-cell therapy, Yescarta, was approved for adult patients with relapsed/refractory large B cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy (Source: Alliance for Regenerative Medicine). We believe that these approvals are indicative of the future potential of many more cellular therapies that address a wide range of diseases. Celgene Corporation (“Celgene”) acquired Juno Therapeutics, Inc., another pioneer in the CAR-T space, in January 2018 for approximately $9 billion. Then, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, in their pursuit of this new space of cancer treatments, acquired Celgene in January 2019 for approximately $74 billion.
 
The complexity of manufacturing individual cell therapy treatments poses a fundamental challenge for cell therapy-based companies as they enter the field. This complexity potentially casts a spotlight on improved cGMP, large-scale manufacturing processes, such as the services provided by Masthercell Global. Manufacturing and delivery can be more complex in cell therapy products than for a typical drug. In the U.S., only a few dozen specialized hospitals are currently qualified to provide CAR T treatments, which require retrieving, processing and then returning immune cells to the patient, all done under strict cGMP, as well as monitoring and treating side effects. These factors provide real incentives for cell therapy companies to seek third-party partners, or contract manufacturers, who possess technical, manufacturing, and regulatory expertise in cell therapy development and manufacturing such as cell therapy CDMOs like MaSTherCell. Additionally, establishing a manufacturing facility for cell therapy requires specific expertise and significant capital which can delay the clinical trials by at least 2 years. As companies are looking to expedite their market approval, utilization of a CDMO can result in faster time to market and overall lower expenditure.

Integration of development and manufacturing and logistics services through Masthercell Global (and its subsidiaries) provide the basis for generating a recurring revenue stream, as well as carefully managing our fixed cost structure to maximize optionality and drive down production cost. We believe that Masthercell Global is also beneficial for our own manufacturing needs and provides us, and our customers, with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market.
 
Consolidation of CDMO Entities and Strategic Funding
 
On June 28, 2018, the Company, Masthercell Global, Great Point Partners, LLC, a manager of private equity funds focused on growing small to medium sized heath care companies (“Great Point”), and certain of Great Point’s affiliates, entered into a series of definitive strategic agreements intended to finance, strengthen and expand Orgenesis’ CDMO business.

Masthercell Global, through the Masthercell Global Subsidiaries, will be engaged in the business of providing manufacturing and development services to third parties related to cell and gene therapy products, processes and solutions and providing related manufacturing or development services, and the creation and development of technology, intellectual property, tools and optimizations in connection with such manufacturing and development services for third parties (the “CDMO Business”). Under the terms of the Stockholders’ Agreement and SPA, Orgenesis has agreed that so long as it owns equity in Masthercell Global and for two years thereafter it will not engage in the CDMO Business, except through Masthercell Global. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Stockholders’ Agreement or the SPA prohibits or restricts the Company’s ability to conduct any business outside the CDMO Business and the Company retained the right to research, manufacture, develop and conduct all other activities related to the development, discovery, manufacturing and commercialization of therapeutic products, and the process, methods and services thereof (including, without limitation, such therapeutic products for itself and in which the Company has an economic interest or any relationship with any Third Party in which the Company has an economic interest or that are created, developed, manufactured or sold by a joint venture, partnership or collaboration between the Company and a Third Party) with a Third Party. For purposes hereof, the term “Third Party” shall mean any entity (other than our Company or our subsidiaries) with whom we (or our subsidiaries) has a collaboration, joint venture, partnership or similar economic relationship for the development of a product with therapeutic use where the primary purpose of such collaboration, joint venture, partnership or relationship is not the manufacturing related to such product. We intend, through our direct subsidiaries, to continue engaging in such research, marketing, development, selling and commercialization of such therapeutic products either for our own internal purposes or with Third Parties.
 
Masthercell Global’s Business
 
Our subsidiary, Masthercell Global, is a CDMO specialized in cell therapy development for advanced therapeutically products. In the last decade, cell therapy medicinal products have gained significant importance, particularly in the fields of ex-vivo gene therapy and immunotherapy. While academic and industrial research has led scientific development in the sector, industrialization and manufacturing expertise remains insufficient. Masthercell Global plans to fill this gap by providing three types of services to its customers: (i) process and assay development services and (ii) current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) contract manufacturing services and (iii) technology innovation and engineering services. These services offer a double advantage to Masthercell Global’s customers. First, customers can continue allocating their financial and human resources on their product/therapy, while relying on a long-term reliable and trusted partner for their process development/production. Second, through its subsidiaries, it allows customers to benefit from Masthercell Global’s expertise in cell therapy manufacturing and all related aspects.
 
Masthercell Global continues to invest in its manufacturing capabilities and services to offer a “one-stop-shop” service to its customers from pre-clinical up to commercial development. MaSTherCell S.A., Masthercell Global’s Belgian subsidiary, has recently inaugurated a new production center in Gosselies, doubling its manufacturing capacity from 600 sqm GMP area to 1,200 sqm. This new facility can also accommodate commercial manufacturing. Masthercell Global’s Israeli-based CDMO, Atvio, has relocated its process engineering activities into a new and larger facility located at Bar-Lev industrial park. These subsidiaries, including Masthercell Global’s Korea-based CDMO, have started to offer viral vector CDMO services. Our target customers are primarily cell therapy companies that are in clinical trials with the aim of accompanying them as their manufacturing and logistic partner once their product candidates reach commercial stage.

We devote significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our future product candidates for our customers, as well as our cost of goods and time to market. This integration of development, manufacturing and logistics services through Masthercell Global aims to provide the basis for generating a recurring revenue stream, as well as carefully managing our fixed cost structure, maximize optionality, and drive long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility provides us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable the more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins.
 
Masthercell Global continues to invest resources to maintain best practices in quality service, quality control, quality assurance and permanent staff training to uphold the highest standards to serve its customers. Masthercell Global (through itself and its subsidiaries) has built-up a team of more than 140 industry experts in Belgium, 30 experts in Korea, 19 experts in Israel and 3 people in the US. The entire team is dedicated to support process development and manufacturing efforts in a fast, safe and cost-effective way. Masthercell Global’s strategy is to build long term relationships with its customers in order to help them bring highly potent cell therapy products faster to the market and in cost-effective ways. To provide these services, Masthercell Global relies on a team of dedicated experts both from academic and industry backgrounds. It operates through state-of-the-art facilities organized as a global network in Belgium, Israel, Korea and soon in the U.S. This network of facilities operates on a common Quality Management System backbone enabling for streamlined technology transfers among the different sites.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
In light of the globalization of the industry in general and the therapeutics industry in particular, adding to that the high cost of reaching the market, developers of cell therapies see themselves as global organizations and build their models on global markets. As cell therapies are based on living cells, they are limited in their ability to be centrally manufactured. An additional challenge for globalization is the fact that the regulatory requirements for the therapies is not harmonized between jurisdictions, presenting additional operational challenges.
 
We have leveraged the recognized quality expertise and experience in cell process development and manufacturing of our Belgian subsidiary, MaSTherCell S.A., to first-class entities in Israel and Korea and to build a global CDMO in the cell therapy development and manufacturing area. We believe that cell therapy companies need to be global in order to truly succeed. We target the international manufacturing market as a key priority through joint-venture agreements that provide development capabilities, along with manufacturing facilities and experienced staff.
 
The main revenue drivers of our growth strategy on a global reach are the number of batches and the number of patients per manufacturing batch. These parameters vary along the development cycle of the new treatments (starting from as few as 20 patients in Phase I to thousands of patients when reaching commercialization). When a client reaches the commercial stage, their demand for manufacturing substantially increases, while barriers preventing the client from switching to another manufacturing organization remain extremely high. The difficulty in transferring CDMOs is a function of the tech transfer of such complex manufacturing processes being extremely lengthy, requiring many months of training highly specialized employees, while also possibly requiring new regulatory approvals. Therefore, we believe we are well positioned to continue expanding our revenue for the following reasons:
 
 -10-
 


(1) | A higher number of companies in later phases of clinical trials and soon potentially in commercial phases;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Therapy companies requiring higher manufacturing abilities concurrent with a global reach; and
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | An increasing need for the manufacturing scalability provided by a CDMO.

Quality. We work alongside our customers to transform the promises of their cell-based therapies into a robust and scalable process, compliant with GMP requirements. Our stringent quality system is applied throughout the process and ensures identity, purity, stability, potency and robustness of cell therapy products from clinical phase I, II, III to commercialization. We continue to invest resources to maintain best practices in quality service, quality control, quality assurance and permanent staff training to uphold the highest standards.
 
Transforming academic technology to clinical and commercial manufacturing. One of the major issues with moving cell therapy products from “bench to manufacturing bedside” has been manufacturing bottlenecks. The heterogeneous nature of cell therapy products has introduced manufacturing complexity and regulatory concerns, as well as scale-up complexities that are not present within traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing. Over the years, MaSTherCell has developed experience and expertise necessary for transforming academic concepts into a clinical manufacturing program to support all phases of clinical trials. This includes assessing the clinical efficiency of the laboratory concept but also the development of efficient, robust and scalable manufacturing processes, including technology engineering service, when needed.
 
Access to a global network. Many companies developing autologous cell therapies envision using multiple manufacturing sites and processing centers to distribute the workload and minimize the shipping distances for such time- sensitive products. Many cell therapy products are fragile preparations that must be shipped and applied to a patient rapidly. This time pressure means that standard product-release testing procedures are not feasible. In particular, sterility testing often cannot be completed before patient treatment. This unique challenge in cell-therapy manufacturing requires tighter environmental and handling controls to greatly reduce any risk of sterility failure. Biotechnology companies have to anticipate their success and the logistics to cure at point of care. Therefore, the setup of a global CDMO meets this requirement and is the strategy behind our establishment of our CDMO facilities in Korea and Israel, and in the U.S. in the future. To comply with anticipated regulatory harmonization, we have also invested in our Quality and Management Systems (QMS) and to structure them in a way they could be shared with either affiliated companies or business partners, and even with customers or prospects. South Korea, Israeli and European requirements are essentially the same, allowing Masthercell Global to implement its QMS model in a quick and efficient way. This truly international footprint will give us a unique competitive advantage, thereby filling the gap of biotechnology companies’ requirement of “quality comparability” between the respective regional sites.
 
Central continental locations to deal with key logistics challenges. With respect to this challenge, through our subsidiaries, Masthercell Global has built up the following:
 

· | Team of dedicated experts both from academic and industry backgrounds with a strong experience in cGMP dealing with not yet harmonized regulatory requirements (European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”), FDA);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | State-of-the-art facilities located next to airports; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | Multi-continental footprints to deal with therapies administration at or nearby point of care as many cell therapy products have a short shelf life.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Providing value-added manufacturing capacity. One of the biggest challenges is developing reliable (quality) and robust manufacturing processes for cell-based therapy products that ensure adequate product safety, potency, and consistency at an economically viable cost. Additionally, manufacturing quality and comparability is at the heart of biotechnology companies’ challenges. MaSTherCell has built-up a strong expertise to customize the production and manufacturing process to suit the particular needs of a given client. This process facilitates a deep understanding of clients’ needs and facilitates a long term revenue generating relationship.
 
Competition in the CDMO Field
 
We compete with a number of companies both directly and indirectly. Key competitors include the following CMOs and CDMOs: Lonza Group Ltd, Progenitor Cell Therapy (PCT) LLC (acquired by Hitachi), WuxiAppTec (WuXi PharmaTech (Cayman) Inc.), Cognate Bioservices Inc., Apceth GmbH & Co. KG, Eufets GmbH, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, Cellforcure SASU, Cell Therapy Catapult Limited and Molmed S.p.A. Some of these companies are large, well-established manufacturers with financial, technical, research and development and sales and marketing resources that are significantly greater than those that we currently possess.

More generally, we face competition inherent in any third-party manufacturer’s business - namely, that potential customers may instead elect to invest in their own facilities and infrastructure, affording them greater control over their products and the hope of long-term cost savings compared to a third party contract manufacturer. To be successful, we will need to convince potential customers that our current and expanding capabilities are more innovative, of higher-quality and more cost-effective than could be achieved through internal manufacturing and that our experience and quality manufacturing and process development expertise are unique in the industry. Our ability to achieve this and to successfully compete against other manufacturers will depend, in large part, on our success in developing technologies that improve both the quality and profitability associated with cell therapy manufacturing. If we are unable to successfully compete against other manufacturers, we may not be able to develop our CDMO business plans which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We believe that Masthercell Global’s services differ from our competition in two major aspects:
 

· | Quality and expertise of its services: Clients identify the excellence of its facility, quality system, and people as a major differentiating point compared to competitors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Agile and tailored approach: Our philosophy is to build a true partnership with our clients and adapt ourselves to clients’ needs, which entails no “off-the-shelf process” nor in-house technology platform, but a dedicated person for each client, joint steering committees on each project and dedicated project managers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

* Diagram above signifies “one-stop-shop service offering” from process development through quality manufacturing and logistics to point of care.
 
We strengthen our position by our “one-stop-shop” service offering, from pre-clinical to commercial, with a clear focus on COGS of manufacturing processes. This differentiation results in a price premium compared to other CMO’s as we operate with a lean organization focused solely on cell therapy. Quality is a critical aspect of our industry, and we believe we have developed unique expertise in this field. We devote significant resources to process development and manufacturing in order to optimize the safety and efficacy of our future product candidates for our customers, as well as our cost of goods and time to market. Our goal is to carefully manage our fixed cost structure, maximize optionality, and drive long-term cost of goods as low as possible. We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility, which provides us with enhanced control of material supply for both clinical trials and the commercial market, will enable a more rapid implementation of process changes, and will allow for better long-term margins.
 
Finally, we have sought to establish manufacturing centers in regions which logistically offers an ideal location given the high concentration of companies active in cell therapy, including potential clients and companies with complementary know-how, products and services.

CDMO Government Regulation
 
We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products or where our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with cGMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, facility registration or licensing, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions, such as the EMA, Health Canada, and the Australian Department of Health, depending on the countries in which our customers market and sell the products we manufacture and/or package on their behalf. We are also required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as discussed below. These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers' products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization.
 
Manufacturing facilities that produce cellular therapies are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. In particular, FDA regulations set forth requirements pertaining to establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1271 provides for a unified registration and listing system, donor-eligibility, current Good Tissue Practice ("cGTP"), and other requirements that are intended to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases by HCT/Ps. More specifically, key elements of Part 1271 include:
 

· | Registration and listing requirements for establishments that manufacture HCT/Ps;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Requirements for determining donor eligibility, including donor screening and testing;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cGTP requirements, which include requirements pertaining to the manufacturer's quality program, personnel, procedures, manufacturing facilities, environmental controls, equipment, supplies and reagents, recovery, processing and process controls, labeling, storage, record-keeping, tracking, complaint files, receipt, pre-distribution shipment, distribution, and donor eligibility determinations, donor screening, and donor testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adverse reaction reporting;
--+----------------------------


· | Labeling of HCT/Ps;
--+--------------------


· | Specific rules for importing HCT/Ps; and
--+-----------------------------------------


· | FDA inspection, retention, recall, destruction, and cessation of manufacturing operations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Masthercell Global currently collects, processes, stores and manufactures HCT/Ps, including the manufacture of cellular therapy products. Therefore, Masthercell Global must comply with cGTP and with the current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements that apply to biological products. Cell and tissue-based products may also be subject to the same approval standards, including demonstration of safety and efficacy, as other biologic and drug products if they fail to meet all HCT/P criteria set forth in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1271.10.
 
The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) and FDA regulations govern the quality control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures of products regulated as a drug or biological products, including cellular therapies comprising HCT/Ps. These laws and regulations include requirements for regulated entities to comply with cGTPs applicable to the specific product(s). The cGTPs are designed to ensure that a facility's processes - and products resulting from those processes - meet defined safety requirements. The FDA's objective in requiring compliance with cGTP standards is to protect the public health and safety by ensuring that regulated products (i) have the identity, strength, quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess; (ii) meet their specifications; and (iii) are free of objectionable microorganisms and contamination. As a central focus of the cGTP requirements, regulated entities must design and build quality assurance safeguards into the manufacturing processes and the production facilities for regulated products and must ensure the consistency, product integrity, and reproducibility of results and product characteristics. This is done by implementing quality systems and processes including appropriate, controlled procedures, specifications and documentation. In addition, drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with applicable cGTPs. The FDA may also initiate for-cause investigations of manufacturing facilities if it learns of possible serious regulatory violations at such facilities. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGTPs. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can result in regulatory inspections and associated observations, warning letters, other enforcement measures requiring remedial action, and, in the case of failures that are more serious, suspension of manufacturing operations, seizure of product, injunctions, product recalls, fines, and other penalties. We believe that our facilities are in material compliance with applicable, existing FDA requirements. Additionally, FDA, other regulatory agencies, or the U.S. Congress may be considering, and may enact laws or regulations regarding the use and marketing of stem cells, cell therapy products, or products derived from human cells or tissue. These laws and regulations may directly affect us or the business of some of Masthercell’s Global’s clients and, therefore, the amount of business Masthercell Global receives from these clients.

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) extends U.S. federal oversight to clinical laboratories that examine or conduct testing on materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease or for the assessment of the health of human beings. CLIA requirements apply to those laboratories that handle biological matter. CLIA requires that these laboratories be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to biennial inspections and remit fees. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA include suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate necessary to conduct business, fines, or criminal penalties. Additionally, CLIA certification may sometimes be needed when an entity, such as Masthercell Global, desires to obtain accreditation, certification, or license from non-government entities for cord blood collection, storage and processing.
 
Our customers’ products must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products may delay or put on hold clinical trials, delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities are not able to demonstrate compliance with cGTPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product is deemed adulterated or misbranded. In addition, if new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 
Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.
 
Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
 
Our CDMO operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials or chemicals. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our contract manufacturing operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The costs associated with complying with the various applicable local, state, national and international regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our CDMO Business — Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our CDMO business, and it may require us to substantially invest in our development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and may negatively impact our ability to generate and meet future demand for our products and improve profitability” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations.
 
PT Business
 
Our therapeutic development efforts in our cell therapy business are focused on advancing breakthrough scientific achievements in the field of autologous therapies which have a curative potential. We base our development on therapeutic collaborations and in-licensing with other pre-clinical and clinical-stage biopharma companies as well as direct collaboration with research and healthcare institutes. We are engaging in therapeutic collaborations and in-licensing with other academic centers and research centers in order to pursue emerging technologies of other ATMPs in cell and gene therapy in such areas as cell-based immunotherapies, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and tissue regeneration. Each of these customers and collaborations represents a growth opportunity and future revenue potential as we out-license these ATMPs through regional partners to whom we also provide regulatory, pre-clinical and training services to support their activity in order to reach patients in a point-of-care hospital setting.
 
PT Subsidiaries and Collaboration Agreements

Background on Our Transdifferentiation Technology
 
Diabetes Mellitus (“DM”), or simply diabetes, is a metabolic disorder usually caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors, and results in abnormally high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Diabetes occurs as a result of impaired insulin production by the pancreatic islet cells. The most common types of the disease are Type-1 Diabetes (“T1D”) and Type-2 Diabetes (“T2D”). In T1D, the onset of the disease follows an autoimmune attack of β-cells that severely reduces β-cell mass. T1D usually has an early onset and is sometimes also called juvenile diabetes. In T2D, the pathogenesis involves insulin resistance, insulin deficiency and enhanced gluconeogenesis, while late progression stages eventually lead to β-cell failure and a significant reduction in β-cell function and mass. T2D often occurs later in life and is sometimes called adult onset diabetes. Both T1D and late-stage T2D result in marked hypoinsulinemia, reduction in β-cell function and mass and lead to severe secondary complications, such as myocardial infarcts, limb amputations, neuropathies and nephropathies and even death. In both cases, patients become insulin-dependent, requiring either multiple insulin injections per day or reliance on an insulin pump.
 
Diabetes is one of the most challenging health problems in the 21st Century, resulting in staggering health, social, and economic impacts. Diabetes is currently the fourth or fifth leading cause of death in most developed countries and has been declared an epidemic in many developing and newly industrialized nations.
 
Within the field of cell therapy, research and development using stem cells to treat a host of diseases and conditions has greatly expanded. All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates, differentiates (matures) and perpetuates in an adult organism throughout its lifetime. Stem cells (in either embryonic or adult forms) are primitive and undifferentiated cells that have the unique ability to transform into or otherwise affect many different cells, such as white blood cells, nerve cells or heart muscle cells. Our technology employs a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes. This new therapeutic approach does not use stem cells, but rather is focused on the use of autologous, fully mature, adult cells.
 
There are two general classes of cell therapies: allogeneic and autologous. In allogeneic procedures, cells collected from a person (the donor) are transplanted into or used to develop a treatment for another patient (the recipient) with or without modification. In cases where the donor and the recipient are the same individual, these procedures are referred to as “autologous”.
 
Our treatment for diabetes focuses on autologous cells that offer a low likelihood of rejection by the patient. We believe the long-term benefits of this treatment can best be achieved with an autologous product. For our purposes in the treatment of diabetes, our cells are derived from the liver or other adult tissue and are transdifferentiated to become adult Autologous Insulin Producing (“AIP”) cells.

Through our Israeli and Belgian subsidiaries, our goal is to advance our AIP cell-based therapy into clinical development. AIP cells utilize the technology of ‘cellular trans-differentiation’ to transform an autologous adult liver cell into a fully functional and physiologically glucose-responsive insulin-producing cell. Treatment with AIP cells is expected to provide Type 1 Diabetes patients with long-term insulin independence. Because AIP cells are autologous, this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy.
 
Threats from Pancreas Islet Transplantation and Cell Therapies
 
To date, a significant portion of the amount invested in diabetes related research and development activities has been directed toward prevention and lifestyle management rather than toward the development of a cure. For some patients with severe and difficult to control diabetes (hypoglycemic unawareness), islet transplants are considered. Pancreatic islets are the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Scientists use enzymes to isolate the islets from the pancreas of a deceased donor. Because the islets are fragile, transplantation must occur soon after they are removed. Typically, a patient receives at least 10,000 islet “equivalents” per kilogram of body weight, extracted from pancreases obtained from different donors. Patients often require two separate transplants to achieve insulin independence.
 
Transplants are often performed by an interventional radiologist, who uses x-rays and ultrasound to guide placement of a catheter - a small plastic tube - through the upper abdomen and into the portal vein of the liver. The islets are then infused slowly through the catheter into the liver. The patient receives a local anesthetic and a sedative. In some cases, a surgeon may perform the transplant through a small incision, using general anesthesia. Because the islets are obtained from cadavers that are unrelated to the patient, the patient needs to be treated with drugs that inhibit the immune response so that the patient doesn’t reject the transplant. In the early days of islet transplantation, the drugs were so powerful that they actually were toxic to the islets; improvements in the procedure are widely used and are now referred to as the Edmonton Protocol.
 
Pancreatic islet transplantation (cadaver donors) is an allogeneic transplant, and, as in all allogeneic transplantations, there is a risk for graft rejection and patients must receive lifelong immune suppressants. Though this technology has shown good results clinically, there are several setbacks, such as patients being sensitive to recurrent T1D autoimmune attacks and a shortage in tissues available for islet cells transplantation.
 
Pancreatic islet auto transplantation is a means of reducing the risk of brittle diabetes following total pancreatectomy. In 1977, researchers at the University of Minnesota School of Medicine pioneered the first Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Autologous Transplant (“TP-IAT”) for the treatment for induced diabetes post-surgery. At that time, islet cell isolation techniques, which had been pursued to treat insulin-dependent diabetes via allotransplant, yielded variable results and raised uncertainty regarding the future efficacy of TP-IAT. Since then, advances in isolation and purification have improved islet transplant outcomes, and the practice of TP-IAT has expanded. In the United States, there are currently approximately 12 centers performing TP-IAT, with 1 to 2 centers annually establishing programs; there is no available information on the worldwide use of this procedure.
 
TP-IAT has the distinct advantage of allowing patients the ability to avoid the significant postoperative complication of surgically induced brittle diabetes. The severity of brittle diabetes, a condition in which a patient experiences both severe hyper and hypoglycemic episodes, should not be underestimated; in one early series, 50% of late deaths after TP were secondary to iatrogenic hypoglycemic episodes. Although total pancreatectomy in the era of modern endocrine and exocrine replacement therapy has witnessed improvements in long-term morbidity and mortality, it remains one of the most morbid abdominal operations performed today.
 
Our Solution
 
We are developing and bringing to clinical stage a technology that is based on the published work of Prof. Sarah Ferber, our Chief Scientific Officer and a researcher at THM, that demonstrates the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver into “pancreatic beta cell-like” insulin-producing cells. Furthermore, those cells were found resistant to the autoimmune attack and able to produce insulin in a glucose-sensitive manner. Our cell therapy business derives from a licensing agreement entered into as of February 2, 2012 by Orgenesis Ltd., our Israeli Subsidiary, and THM pursuant to which our Israeli Subsidiary was granted a worldwide royalty bearing an exclusive license to certain information regarding a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin-producing cells as a treatment for diabetes (the “THM License Agreement”).

Toward this goal, we are working to advance a unique product into clinical development. AIP cells utilize the technology of ‘cellular trans-differentiation’ to transform an autologous adult liver cell into an adult, fully functional and physiologically glucose-responsive pancreatic-like insulin producing cell. Treatment with AIP cells is expected to provide diabetes patients with long-term insulin independence. Our aim is to develop our AIP cell therapy in the treatment of diabetes by essentially correcting malfunctioning organs with new functional tissues created from the patient’s own existing organs.
 

Because the AIP cells are autologous, this benefit should be achieved and maintained without the need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. The procedure to generate AIP cells begins with liver tissue accessed via needle biopsy from a patient. The liver tissue is then sent to a CDMO, such as MaSTherCell, where biopsied liver cells are isolated, expanded and trans-differentiated into AIP cells. The final product is a solution of AIP cells, which are packaged in an infusion bag and sent back to the patient’s treating physician where the cells are transplanted back into the patient’s liver via portal vein infusion. The entire process, from biopsy to transplantation, is expected to take 5-6 weeks.
 

Unique Benefits of AIP Cells
 
 -21-
 

We believe that our singular focus on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of AIP cells may have many and meaningful benefits over other technologies, including:
 

· | Physiologically glucose-responsive insulin production within one week of AIP cell transplantation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Insulin-independence within one month;
--+---------------------------------------


· | Single course of therapy (~10-year insulin-independence);
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | No need for concomitant immunosuppressive therapy;
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Return to (near) normal quality of life for patients;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Single liver biopsy supplies unlimited source of therapeutic tissue (bio-banking for future use if needed);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Highly controlled and tightly closed GMP systems; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Quality control of final product upon release and distribution.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are aware of no other company focused on development of AIP cells based on trans-differentiation. The pharmaceutical industry is fragmented, and it is a competitive market. We compete with many pharmaceutical companies, both large and small and there may be technologies in development of which we are not aware.
 
We believe our ability to further develop our AIP cells is augmented by the following:
 
IP Strength - Orgenesis has broad patent claims on its process and has both issued and pending patents in the U.S. and internationally. The patent portfolio includes granted patent US 8119405, entitled “Methods of inducing regulated pancreatic hormone production in non-pancreatic islet tissues,” which includes broad claims on trans-differentiating any mature, non-pancreatic cell type into an islet cell phenotype. Importantly, the company’s IP portfolio is not dependent on processes owned by other companies, such as embryonic stem cell technologies, production of endodermal intermediates or reprogramming (iPS) technologies. As a result, the company has both freedom to operate and ability to obstruct competitors in developing autologous cells for treatment of diabetes.
 
Simplicity - There is no need for anti-rejection treatment or encapsulation. Using liver as pancreatic progenitor tissue allows the diabetic patient to be the donor of his own insulin-producing tissue, thus allowing autologous implantations with no need for anti-rejection therapy, which restricts the target population only to adult, severe diabetic patients. Moreover, drugs used for preventing the allo-transplanted tissue rejection are deleterious to insulin producing cell function and to the patient.
Safety - the generated cells do not regress to pluripotency, and no adverse effects of uncontrolled cells proliferation occur. The cells are already mature and can be inserted in to the patient following extensive quality assurance testing. Moreover, our cells transplanted in rodents do not cause any adverse effects even following many weeks in the animals.
Availability - Sufficient liver cells to treat a patient as well to store cells for additional future treatments may be generated. The cells can be frozen and thawed, without losing the trans-differentiation capacity for up to 20 passages in culture. It is anticipated that a biopsy from the diabetic patient's own liver is sufficient to generate enough insulin-producing cells to replace the entire cell function and control blood glucose level. As opposed to islets that are non-dividing (i.e., post-mitotic), it is necessary to use stem cells to generate sufficient numbers of cells that are then differentiated.
Future Product Candidates - Currently, liver cells are best suited for generating AIP cells. Future products may involve the use of cell types other than liver that are more easily accessible from the diabetic patient or from unrelated donors. Additionally, other adult cells (i.e. fibroblasts) may be studied for trans-differentiation into functional cells in diseases other than insulin-dependent disorders (i.e. neurodegenerative).
The THM License Agreement
 
Our cell therapy business derives from a licensing agreement entered into as of February 2, 2012 by Orgenesis Ltd., our Israeli Subsidiary, and THM pursuant to which our Israeli Subsidiary was granted a worldwide royalty bearing and exclusive license to certain information regarding a molecular and cellular approach directed at converting liver cells into functional insulin producing cells as a treatment for diabetes (the “THM License Agreement”). By using therapeutic agents (i.e., PDX-1, and additional pancreatic transcription factors in an adenovirus-vector) that efficiently convert a sub-population of liver cells into pancreatic islets phenotype and function, this approach allows the diabetic patient to be the donor of his own therapeutic tissue. We believe that this provides major competitive advantage to the cell transformation technology of our Israeli Subsidiary.

Competition in the Cell Therapy Field
 
The current treatment for T1D, and some T2D, is constant monitoring of blood glucose and a highly controlled diet, coupled with multiple daily insulin injections. Despite the use of insulin and advances in its delivery, pharmaceutical insulin injections cannot replicate the level of feedback control afforded by naturally occurring intact beta cells. Even with the most diligent insulin use, the adverse short- and long-term effects of diabetes include life-threatening episodes of low blood sugar, nerve damage, blindness, kidney damage, erectile dysfunction, foot ulcers leading to amputations, and cardiovascular disease. Research has shown that, on average, the life expectancy of a person with T1D is reduced by approximately 12 years when compared to the general population.
 
T1D inflicts a significant economic cost on the U.S. healthcare system, estimated at $14.4 billion annually, and it is expected that a therapy that can modify the course of T1D could potentially achieve significant cost savings, and thus command high market penetration and premium pricing. In the near future, the market for T1D is expected to continue to be dominated by insulin replacement therapies.
 
Currently, there are no approved therapies for new onset T1D with potential curative effect but only regimens such as insulin or adjuvants to insulin that address the disease when the pancreas can no longer produce insulin. While not a direct competitor, in a more advanced population of T1D, sotagliflozin, an oral adjunctive therapy to insulin, is expected to receive FDA approval following positive results from a pivotal Phase 3 trial conducted by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with Sanofi SA and JDRF. There are multiple agents in development targeting the modification of the course of the disease. Current approaches in development can be broadly divided into immune modulatory agents that attempt to improve metabolic function by rescuing insulin producing beta cells, or regenerative agents that attempt to replace beta cells. From a broad review of these agents and approaches, no other autologous therapy for T1D is expected to be in advanced clinical trials or provide direct competition to our AIP cells in the near future. Other allogeneic approaches, such as Viactye’s PEC-01 technology, may enter clinical trials in the near future.
 
Insulin therapy is used for Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) patients who are not controlled with oral medications, although this therapy has well-known and well-characterized disadvantages. Weight gain is a common side effect of insulin therapy, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Injection of insulin causes pain and inconvenience for patients. Patient compliance and inconvenience of self-administering multiple daily insulin injections is also considered a disadvantage of this therapy. The most serious adverse effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycemia.
 
The biopharmaceutical industry, and the rapidly evolving market for developing cell-based therapies is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations as well as established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 
Specifically, we face significant competition from companies in the insulin therapy market. Insulin therapy is widely used for Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) patients who are not controlled with oral medications. The global diabetes market comprising the insulin, insulin analogues and other anti-diabetic drugs has been evolving rapidly. A look at the diabetes market reveals that it is dominated by a handful of participants such as Novo Nordisk A/S, Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi-Aventis, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Pfizer Inc., Merck KgaA, and Bayer AG.
 
PT Revenue Model
 
Through analysis of the cell therapy landscape, we are introducing a novel POCare therapy business model with our goal of bringing autologous therapies in a cost-effective, high-quality and scalable manner to patients. We are establishing and positioning our PT business in order to bring POCare therapies to patients in a scalable way via a network of leading healthcare facilities active in autologous cell therapy product development, including facilities in Germany, Austria, Greece, the U.S., Korea and Japan.
 
 -24-
 

Our unique understanding of industry needs allows us to offer our clients a range of technologies and processes that potentially generate revenues. This may include:
 

· | Development Services – Industrial manufacturing know-how to the cell and gene therapy arena, thus reducing cost of goods and facilitating regulatory scrutiny, higher automation level required to increase process robustness and reduce attrition rates, biological assay development, assay validation and assay optimization;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sub-Licensing Fees – Innovative technologies such as scaffolds and IoT sensors and closed system bioreactors that allow autologous cell manufacturing in lower grade clean rooms; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | POCare Services – Regulatory assistance and joint ventures with local partners who bring strong regional networks through (1) joint venture partnerships with local hospitals utilizing hospital networks for clinical development of therapies, (2) a global network of supply, (3) harmonized quality systems, (4) the provision of a comprehensive portfolio of ATMPs to hospitals via continuous in-licensing of autologous therapies from academia and research institutes, and (4) out-licensing hospital and academic-based therapies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PT Business Strategy
 
Our aim is to provide a pathway to bring ATMPs in the cell and gene therapy industry from research to patients worldwide through our POCare network. We define POCare cell and gene therapy as a process of collecting, processing and administering cells within the patient care environment, namely through academic partnerships in a hospital setting. We believe this approach is an attractive proposition for personalized medicine because POCare therapy facilitates the development of technologies through our strategic partnerships and utilizes closed systems that have the potential of reducing the required grade of clean room facilities, thus substantially reducing manufacturing costs. Furthermore, cell transportation, which is a high-risk and costly aspect of the supply chain, could be minimized or eliminated.
 
While our PT business strategy is currently limited to early stage development to overcome certain industry challenges, we intend to continue developing a global POCare network, with the goal of developing ATMPs, and namely autologous cell therapies, via joint ventures with partners who bring strong regional networks. Such networks include partnerships with local hospitals which allows us to engage in continuous in-licensing of, namely, autologous therapies from academia and research institutes, co-development of hospital and academic-based therapies, and utilization of hospital networks for clinical development of therapies.
 
We consider the following to be the four pillars in order to advance our PT business strategy:
 

· | Innovation – This leverages our unique know-how and expertise for industrial processes, operational excellence, process development and optimization, quality control assays development, quality management systems and regulatory expertise.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Systems – We are developing cell production cGMP systems utilizing sensor technology and AI-based systems for biological production, closed system devices for processing cells, proprietary virus/ media technologies and partnerships with key system providers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cell and Gene Products – We intend to grow our internal asset pipeline consisting of our unique portfolio of immuno-oncology related technologies, MSC and liver-based therapies and secretome-based therapies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Distribution – Our plan is to enable the industrialization, commercialization and distribution of POCare systems in major hospitals and key geographies, including Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.

Maryland Technology Development Corporation
 
On June 30, 2014, the Company’s U.S. Subsidiary entered into a grant agreement with Maryland Technology Development Corporation (“TEDCO”). TEDCO was created by the Maryland State Legislature in 1998 to facilitate the transfer and commercialization of technology from Maryland’s research universities and federal labs into the marketplace and to assist in the creation and growth of technology based businesses in all regions of the State. TEDCO is an independent organization that strives to be Maryland’s lead source for entrepreneurial business assistance and seed funding for the development of startup companies in Maryland’s innovation economy. TEDCO administers the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund to promote State funded stem cell research and cures through financial assistance to public and private entities within the State. Under the agreement, TEDCO has agreed to give the U.S. Subsidiary an amount not to exceed approximately $406 thousand (the “Grant”). The Grant will be used solely to finance the costs to conduct the research project entitled “Autologous Insulin Producing (AIP) Cells for Diabetes” during a period of two years. On June 21, 2016, TEDCO approved an extension for the project period until June 30, 2017.
 
On July 22, 2014 and September 21, 2015, the U.S. Subsidiary received an advance payment of $406 thousand on account of the Grant. Through November 30, 2018, the Company utilized $356 thousand from the grant and recorded it as a deduction of research and development expenses in the statement of comprehensive loss.
 
Research and Development
 
We incurred $7,386 and $3,326 thousand in research and development expenditures in the fiscal years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which $922 thousand and $848 thousand was covered by grant funding. The increase in research and development expenses was due to an increase in salaries and related expenses for the year ended November 30, 2018, as compared to 2017 and reflects management’s plan to move our transdifferentiation technology to the next the stage towards clinical studies. In the fiscal year ended 2018, we focused mainly on setting up infrastructure and regulatory approvals for sourcing of liver tissue and biopsies and combining the in-vitro research to increase insulin production and secretion with our pre-clinical studies’ aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product in animal models. In this respect, new transdifferentiation methods are being evaluated. Sourcing of the starting material (liver sampling and cell collection) and upscaling of virus production and cell propagation using advance technologies complement this effort with the target to establish start to end production capabilities. Our research and development scope was also expanded to the evaluation and development of new cell therapies related technologies in the field of immunoncology, liver pathologies and tissue regeneration.

Government Regulation
 
We have not sought approval from the FDA for the AIP cells. Among all forms of cell therapy modalities, we believe that autologous cell replacement therapy is of the highest benefit. We believe that it is safer than other options as it does not alter the host genome but only alters the set of expressed epigenetic information that seems to be highly specific to the reprogramming protocol. It provides an abundant source of therapeutic tissue, which is not rejected by the patient and does not have to be treated by immune suppressants. It is highly ethical because no human organ donations or embryo-derived cells are needed. The proposed therapeutic approach does not require cell bio-banking at birth, which is both expensive and cannot be used for patients born prior to 2000.
 
Over the past decade, many studies published in leading scientific journals confirmed the capacity of reprogramming adult cells from many of our mature organs to either alternate organs or to “stem like cells”. Most widely used autologous cell replacement protocols are used for autologous implantation of bone marrow stem cells. This protocol is widely used in patients undergoing a massive chemotherapy session that destroys their bone marrow cells. However, the stem cells used for cancer patients delineated above do not require extensive manipulation and is regarded by the FDA as “minimally manipulated.”
 
An additional autologous cell therapy approach already used in man is autologous chondrocyte implantation (“ACI”). In the United States, Genzyme Corporation provides the only FDA approved ACI treatment called Carticel. The Carticel treatment is designated for young, healthy patients with medium to large sized damage to cartilage. During an initial procedure, the patient’s own chondrocytes are removed arthroscopically from a non-load-bearing area from either the intercondylar notch or the superior ridge of the medial or lateral femoral condyles.
 
To aid us in our efforts to achieve the highest level of compliance with FDA requirements, we have looked to hire experts in the field of pharmaceutical compliance.
 
Regulatory Process in the United States
 
Our product is subject to regulation as a biological product under the Public Health Service Act and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA generally requires the following steps for pre-market approval or licensure of a new biological product:

· | Pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests conducted in compliance with the Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements to assess a drug’s biological activity and to identify potential safety problems, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and stability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 -29-
 


· | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can start;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce a first human biologic drug candidate into humans in clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations and standards;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing that includes adequate results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The FDA reviews the marketing application in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, effective and potent for its intended uses; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obtaining FDA approval of the BLA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility as compliant with cGMP requirements, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent. The FDA may also require post marketing testing and surveillance of approved products or place other conditions on the approvals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Process in Europe
 
The European Union (“EU”) has approved a regulation specific to cell and tissue therapy product, the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (“ATMP”) regulation. For products such as our AIP cells that are regulated as an ATMP, the EU directive requires:

· | Compliance with current cGMP regulations and standards, pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Filing a Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) with the various member states or a centralized procedure;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (“VHP”), a procedure which makes it possible to obtain a coordinated assessment of an application for a clinical trial that is to take place in several European countries;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Obtaining approval of ethic committees of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the AIP into humans in clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Submission to EMEA for a Marketing Authorization (“MA”); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Review and approval of the MAA (“Marketing Authorization Application”).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As in the U.S., prior to the general regulatory process of a new biologic products, we will prosecute an Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of Patients with Established Diabetes Mellitus (“DM”) Induced by Total pancreatectomy. In the EU, in order to be qualified, the prevalence must be below 5 per 10,000 of the EU population, except where the expected return on investment is insufficient to justify the investment.
 
Authorized orphan medicines benefit from 10 years of protection from market competition with similar medicines with similar indications once they are approved. Companies applying for designated orphan medicines pay reduced fees for regulatory activities. This includes reduced fees for protocol assistance, marketing-authorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Typically, both in the U.S. and the EU, clinical testing involves a three-phase process, although the phases may overlap. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy, as well as safety and potency. In some circumstances, the FDA or EMA may require Phase IV or post-marketing trials if it feels that additional information needs to be collected about the drug after it is on the market. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, as well as clinical trial investigators. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA or EMA.
