ITEM 1 — BUSINESS
Overview
EZCORP, Inc. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas. We are a leading provider of pawn loans in the United States and Latin America with approximately 6,800 team members.
Our vision is to be the market leader in responsibly and respectfully meeting our customers’ desire for access to cash when they want it. That vision is supported by four key imperatives:

• | Market Leading Customer Satisfaction;


• | Exceptional Staff Engagement;


• | Most Efficient Provider of Cash; and


• | Attractive Shareholder Returns.

As of September 30, 2019, we operated a total of 1,014 locations, consisting of:

• | 512 United States pawn stores (operating primarily as EZPAWN or Value Pawn & Jewelry);


• | 357 Mexico pawn stores (operating primarily as Empeño Fácil);


• | 123 pawn stores in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Peru (operating as GuatePrenda and MaxiEfectivo); and


• | 22 financial services stores in Canada (operating as CASHMAX).

At our pawn stores, we offer pawn loans, which are non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property, and sell merchandise to customers looking for good value. The merchandise we sell consists of second-hand collateral forfeited from our pawn lending activities or purchased from customers. By store count, we are the second largest pawn store owner and operator in the U.S. and one of the largest in Latin America. During fiscal 2019, we opened 22 de novo stores in Latin America, acquired twelve pawn stores in Mexico and Nevada and completed rollout of our POS2 system across all stores in the U.S. and Mexico through October 2019. We began development of a mobile application providing banking and pawn related services on a differentiated digital customer-centric engagement platform (“Lana,” previously described as “Evergreen”). We believe this platform will allow us to leverage our existing store and pawn customer base footprint to expand customer acquisition and retention and enable rapid deployment of new products.
In addition to our core pawn business in the U.S. and Latin America, we operate CASHMAX financial services locations in Canada. We also own 34.75% of Cash Converters International Limited (“Cash Converters International”), a publicly traded company (ASX: CCV) headquartered in Perth, Western Australia. Cash Converters International and its controlled companies comprise a diverse group generating revenues from franchising, store operations, personal finance and vehicle finance, with operations in Australia and the United Kingdom, a 25% equity interest in Cash Converters New Zealand and a franchise presence in a 15 other countries around the world.
We remain focused on growing our balance of pawn loans outstanding (“PLO”) and the resulting higher pawn service charges (“PSC”). The following charts present sources of net revenues, including PSC, merchandise sales gross profit (“Merchandise sales GP”) and jewelry scrapping gross profit (“Jewelry scrapping GP”):

Pawn Activities
At our pawn stores, we offer pawn loans, which are typically small, non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property. As of September 30, 2019, we had a closing pawn loan principal balance of $199.1 million, from which we earn pawn service charges. In fiscal 2019, pawn service charges accounted for approximately 39% of our total revenues and 65% of our net revenues.
While allowable pawn service charges vary by state and loan size, our U.S. pawn loans primarily earn 13% to 25% per month as permitted by applicable law, excluding forfeitures. The total U.S. pawn loan term generally ranges between 30 and 90 days. Individual loans vary depending on the valuation of each item pawned, but our U.S. pawn loans typically average between $100 and $120.
In Mexico, pawn loans earn 15% to 21% per month as permitted by applicable law, excluding forfeitures. The Mexico pawn loan primary term is 30 days. Individual loans are made in Mexican pesos and vary depending on the valuation of each item pawned, but our Mexico pawn loans typically average between 1,100 and 1,300 Mexican pesos, or approximately $60 on average using the average exchange rate for fiscal 2019.
In Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Peru, pawn loans earn 12% to 18% per month as permitted by applicable law, excluding forfeitures. The pawn loan primary term in these countries is 30 days. Individual loans are made in the local currency of the country and vary depending on the valuation of each item pawned, but our pawn loans in these countries typically average between $100 and $120 using the average exchange rates for fiscal 2019. The average loan amounts tend to be higher in these countries than in Mexico due to the higher concentration of jewelry loans in these countries.

Collateral for our pawn loans consists of tangible personal property, generally jewelry, consumer electronics, power tools, sporting goods and musical instruments. We generally lend from 40% to 70% of the collateral’s estimated resale value depending on a subjective evaluation of a variety of factors, including the estimated probability of the loan’s redemption, and we may additionally offer to purchase the product outright. We consider general merchandise more susceptible to obsolescence while jewelry generally retains commodity value.
If a customer chooses not to repay, renew or extend a pawn loan, the collateral is forfeited and becomes inventory available for sale. We do not record loan losses or charge-offs of pawn loans because the principal amount of an unpaid loan becomes the inventory carrying cost of the forfeited collateral. If the subsequent sale of the forfeited collateral is less than the loan value, this is reflected in gross margin.
The redemption rate represents the percentage of loans made that are repaid, renewed or extended, including loans that may extend multiple times in a given time period. The following table presents our pawn loan redemption rates by segment: 
 | Fiscal Year Ended September 30,
Redemption Rate | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
U.S. Pawn | 84 | % | | 84 | % | 84 | %
Empeño Fácil | | % | | | % | 78 | %

Our ability to offer quality second-hand goods at prices significantly lower than original retail prices attracts value-conscious customers. The gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the loan or purchase value at the time the property is either accepted as loan collateral or purchased. As our inventory and sales involve gold and jewelry, our results can be heavily influenced by the market price of gold.
Customers in the United States and the majority of our Latin America stores may purchase a product protection plan that allows them to exchange certain general merchandise (non-jewelry) sold through our retail pawn operations within six months of purchase. We also offer a jewelry VIP package, which guarantees customers a minimum future pawn loan amount on the item sold, allows them full credit if they trade in the item to purchase a more expensive piece of jewelry, and provides minor repair service on the item sold. Customers may also purchase an item on layaway by paying a minimum layaway deposit of typically 10% of the item’s sale price, in addition to an upfront fee. We hold items on layaway for a 90 to 180-day period, during which the customer is required to pay the balance of the sales price through a series of installment payments. If a payment is missed, we hold the item for a maximum of 30 days, after which it is returned to active inventory for sale.
CASHMAX Financial Services
We operate 22 financial services stores in Canada under the CASHMAX brand. All of the stores are located in the Ontario province, in and around Toronto. These small footprint locations have historically offered primarily short-term, single-payment loans with due dates corresponding to the customer’s next payday (known as “payday loans”). In response to regulatory changes effective January 1, 2018, which reduced the economic returns of the payday lending model, we introduced installment loan products to meet the broader needs of our customers. In addition to payday loans, all CASHMAX stores are now offering installment loans with terms ranging from six to 18 months and average yields of 47% per annum. In November 2018, we entered into a financing arrangement with a third-party lender to provide up to CAD $25 million to fund originations of installment loans through November 2019. As of September 30, 2019, our obligation under the financing facility was CAD $0.8 million (USD $0.6 million).
Operations
Our pawn operations are designed to provide the optimum level of support to the store teams, supplying coaching, mentoring and problem solving to identify opportunities to better serve our customers and position us to be the leader in customer service and satisfaction.
Our risk management structure consists of asset protection and compliance departments, which monitor the inventory system, lending practices, regulatory compliance and compliance with our policies and procedures. We perform full physical audits of inventory at each store at least annually, and more often in higher risk stores or those recently experiencing higher shrinkage. Inventory counts are completed daily for jewelry and firearms, and other inventory categories more susceptible to theft are cycle counted multiple times annually. We record shrink adjustments for known losses at the conclusion of each inventory count; as estimates during interim periods and as discovered during cycle counts.
Our success is dependent upon our team members’ ability to provide prompt and courteous customer service and to execute our operating procedures and standards. To achieve our long-range people goals, we offer management and technical skills training

utilizing computer-based training modules that can be accessed at the store and district levels. It is mandatory that all field and corporate team members complete specific compliance training annually. We offer formalized management development training to specific executives to enhance their management capabilities and effectiveness and to enhance their career progression. We maintain field trainers who travel to stores to provide hands-on training in high skill areas, such as jewelry evaluation, firearms handling and information technology. Generally, we expect that store team members, including managers, will meet certain competency criteria prior to hire or promotion and participate in on-going training classes and formal instructional programs. Our store level and management training programs are designed to develop and advance our team members and provides training for the efficient integration of experienced managers and team members from outside the company.
Growth and Expansion
We plan to expand the number of locations we operate through opening new (“de novo”) locations and through acquisitions in both Latin America and the United States and potential new markets. Our ability to add new stores is dependent on several variables, such as projected achievement of internal investment hurdles, the availability of acceptable sites or acquisition candidates, the alignment of acquirer/seller price expectations, the regulatory environment, local zoning ordinances, access to capital and availability of qualified personnel.
During fiscal 2019, we grew our store count and began development of new products as follows:

• | We opened 22 de novo stores in Latin America (12 in Mexico, 6 in Guatemala, 3 in Honduras and 1 in Peru).


• | In December 2018, we acquired five pawn stores in Mexico.


• | In June 2019, we acquired seven pawn stores operating under the name "Metro Pawn" in Nevada, entering the Reno market and expanding our presence in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.


• | We began development of a mobile application providing banking and pawn related services on a differentiated digital customer-centric engagement platform (“Lana”). This platform will allow us to leverage our existing store and pawn customer base footprint to expand customer acquisition and retention and enable rapid deployment of new products.


• | In October 2019, we completed rollout of our POS2 system (upgraded point of sale system which will allow us to make better pricing decisions and drive higher returns on earning assets) across all stores in the U.S. and Mexico.

We now own a total of 480 stores in Latin America, representing 48% of our total pawn stores. In fiscal 2019, these stores represented 21% of our consolidated net revenues as the average scale of Latin America pawn stores is smaller than in the United States. We see opportunity for further expansion in Latin America through both acquisitions and de novo openings.
For further information about our acquisitions, see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
Historically, pawn service charges are highest in our fourth fiscal quarter (July through September) due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season in the United States and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June) following the tax refund season in the United States. Merchandise sales are highest in our first and second fiscal quarters (October through March) due to the holiday season, jewelry sales in the United States surrounding Valentine’s Day and the availability of tax refunds in the United States. Most of our Latin America customers receive additional compensation from their employers in December, and many also receive additional compensation in June or July, applying downward pressure on loan balances and fueling some merchandise sales in those periods. As a net effect of these and other factors and excluding discrete charges, our consolidated profit before tax is generally highest in our first fiscal quarter (October through December) and lowest in our third fiscal quarter (April through June).
Competition
We encounter significant competition in connection with all of our activities. These competitive conditions may have an impact on our revenues, profitability and ability to expand. We compete with other pawn stores, credit service organizations, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, such as consumer finance companies. We believe that the primary elements of competition are the quality of customer service and relationship management, including understanding our customers’ needs better than anyone else, convenience, store location and a customer friendly environment. In addition, we believe the ability to compete effectively will be based increasingly on strong general management, regional focus, automated management information systems, access to capital and superior customer service.
Our competitors for merchandise sales include numerous retail and wholesale stores such as jewelry stores, discount retail stores, consumer electronics stores, other pawn stores, other resale stores, electronic commerce retailers and auction sites. Competitive factors in our retail operations include the ability to provide the customer with a variety of merchandise at an exceptional value coupled with exceptional customer service and convenient locations.
The pawn industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. The industry consists of pawn stores owned primarily by independent operators who own one to three locations, and the industry is relatively mature. We are the second largest operator of pawn stores in the United States.
The pawn industry in Latin America is also fragmented, but less so than in the United States. The industry consists of pawn stores owned by independent operators and chains, including some not-for-profit organizations. We are the second largest for-profit operator in Mexico. The pawn industry, particularly full-line stores offering general merchandise and jewelry loans and resale, remains in an expansion stage in Latin America.
Trademarks and Trade Names
We operate our U.S. pawn stores principally under the names “EZPAWN” or “Value Pawn & Jewelry,” our Mexico pawn stores principally under the name “EMPEÑO FÁCIL,” our Guatemala pawn stores under the name “GuatePrenda,” and our El Salvador, Honduras and Peru pawn stores under the name “MaxiEfectivo.” Our financial services stores in Canada operate under the name “CASHMAX.” We have registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office the names EZPAWN and EZCORP, among others. In Mexico, we have registered with the Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial the names “EMPEÑO FÁCIL,” “Bazareño,” “Presta Dinero” and “Montepio San Patricio.” We have registered the name “GuatePrenda” in Guatemala and the name “MaxiEfectivo” in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Peru.
Regulation
Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is an integral part of how we manage our business, and we conduct our business in material compliance with all of these rules. The following is a general description of significant regulations affecting our business. For a geographic breakdown of our operating locations, see “Part I, Item 2 — Properties.”
U.S. Regulations
Pawn Regulations — Our pawn stores are regulated by the states in which they are located and, in some cases, by individual municipalities or other local authorities. The applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations vary from location to location and typically impose licensing requirements for pawn stores or individual pawn store team members. Licensing requirements typically relate to financial responsibility and character and may establish restrictions on where pawn stores can operate. Additional rules regulate various aspects of the day-to-day pawn operations including the pawn service charges that a pawn store may charge, the maximum amount of a pawn loan, the minimum or maximum term of a pawn loan, the content and format of the pawn ticket, and the length of time after a loan default that a pawn store must hold a pawned item before it can be offered for sale. Failure to observe applicable regulations could result in a revocation or suspension of pawn licenses, the imposition of fines or requirements to refund service charges and fees, and other civil or criminal penalties. We must also comply with various federal requirements regarding the disclosure of the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments and payment schedule related to each pawn loan transaction. Additional federal regulations applicable to our pawn lending business are described in “Other Regulations” below.
The majority of our pawn stores, voluntarily or pursuant to applicable laws, provide periodic (generally daily) reports to local law enforcement agencies. These reports provide local law enforcement with information about the items received from customers (whether through pawn or purchase), including a detailed description of the goods involved and the name and address of the customer. If we accept as collateral or purchase merchandise from a customer and it is determined that our customer was not the rightful owner, the merchandise is subject to recovery by the rightful owner and those losses are included in our shrinkage. Historically, we have not experienced a material number of claims of this nature.
Some of our pawn stores in the U.S. handle firearms and each of those stores maintains a federal firearms license as required by federal law. The federal Gun Control Act of 1968 and regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms also require each pawn store dealing in firearms to maintain a permanent written record of all receipts and dispositions of firearms. In addition, we must comply with the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which requires us to conduct a background check before releasing, selling or otherwise disposing of firearms.
Other Regulations — Our pawn lending activities are subject to other state and federal statutes and regulations, including the following:

• | We are subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its underlying regulations, as well as various state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these regulations, we are required to disclose to our customers our policies and practices relating to the protection and sharing of customers’ nonpublic personal information. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of customers’ nonpublic personal information, and many of these regulations dictate certain actions that we must take to notify customers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. We are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act which was enacted, in part, to address privacy concerns associated with the sharing of consumers’ financial information and credit history contained in consumer credit reports and limits our ability to share certain consumer report information. We are subject to the Federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and mitigating identity theft, and to adopt various policies and procedures (including team member training) that address and aid in detecting and responding to suspicious activity or identify theft “red flags.”


• | Under the USA PATRIOT Act, we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program that includes the development of internal policies, procedures and controls; the designation of a compliance officer; an ongoing team member training program; and an independent audit function to test the program.


• | We are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and its underlying regulations, which require us to report and maintain records of certain high-dollar transactions. In addition, federal laws and regulations prohibit us from doing business with terrorists and require us to report certain suspicious transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (“FinCen”). Generally, a transaction is considered to be suspicious if we know, suspect or have reason to suspect that the transaction (a) involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended to hide or disguise such funds, (b) is designed to evade the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act or (c) appears to serve no legitimate business or lawful purpose.


• | The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") was enacted for the purpose of making it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit the willful use of mail or any means of instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to influence the foreign official in his or her official capacity, induce the foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her lawful duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.


• | Effective October 2016, Department of Defense regulations promulgated under the Military Lending Act (the “MLA”), formerly applicable to payday loans and auto title loans, were expanded to include various additional forms of consumer credit, including pawn loans. The MLA regulations limit the annual percentage rate charged on consumer loans made to active military personnel or their dependents to 36%.

Under certain circumstances, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) may be able to exercise regulatory authority over the U.S. pawn industry through its rule making authority. To date, the CFPB has not taken any steps to exercise such authority or indicated any intention to do so.
Mexico Regulations
Pawn Regulations — Federal law in Mexico provides for administrative regulation of the pawnshop industry by Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor (PROFECO), Mexico’s primary federal consumer protection agency. PROFECO regulates the form and terms of pawn loan contracts (but not interest or service charge rates) and defines certain operating standards and procedures for pawnshops, including retail operations, and establishes registration, disclosure, bonding and reporting requirements. There are significant fines and sanctions, including operating suspensions, for failure to comply with PROFECO’s rules and regulations. 
PROFECO requires that we report certain transactions (or series of transactions) that exceed certain monetary limits. Anti-money laundering regulations restrict the use of cash in certain transactions. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on “vulnerable activities,” which includes certain high-value pawn and precious metal transactions.
The Federal Personal Information Protection Law requires us to protect our customers’ personal information. Specifically, the law requires us to inform customers if we share customer personal information with third parties and to post (both online and in-store) our privacy policy.
Our pawn business in Mexico is also subject to regulation at the state and local level through state laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances. For example, some states require permits for pawn stores to operate, certification of team members as trained in the valuation of merchandise, and strict customer identification controls. State and local agencies often have authority to suspend store operations pending resolution of actual or alleged regulatory, licensing and permitting issues.
Other Regulations — Our pawn business in Mexico is subject to the General Law of Administrative Responsibility (“GLAR”), effective July 2017. GLAR establishes administrative penalties for improper payments to government officials, influence peddling (including the hiring of public officials and the use of undue influence) and other corrupt acts in public procurement processes. 
We are also subject to The Federal Law for the Prevention and Identification of Transactions with Funds from Illegal Sources, which requires reporting of certain transactions exceeding certain monetary limits, maintenance of customer identification records and controls, and reporting of all non-Mexican customer transactions. This law affects all industries in Mexico and is intended to detect commercial activities arising from illicit or ill-gotten means through bilateral cooperation between Mexico’s Ministry of Finance and Public Credit and Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office. The law also restricts the use of cash in certain transactions associated with high-value assets and limits, and to the extent possible, money laundering activities protected by the anonymity that such cash transactions provide. Relevant aspects of the law specifically affecting the pawn industry include monthly reporting on “vulnerable activities,” which include pawn transactions exceeding 135,606 Mexican pesos and retail transactions of precious metals exceeding 135,606 Mexican pesos. Retail transactions of precious metals exceeding 271,213 Mexican pesos are prohibited. There are significant fines and sanctions for failure to comply with these rules.
 In addition to the above, our pawn business in Mexico is subject to various general business regulations in the areas of tax compliance, customs, consumer protections, money laundering, civil protection regulations, municipal regulations, trade code (federal), public safety and employment matters, among others, by various federal, state and local governmental agencies.
Other Latin American Regulations
Local governmental entities in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Peru also regulate lending and retail businesses. Certain laws and local zoning and permitting ordinances require basic commercial business licenses and signage permits. Operating in these countries also subjects us to other types of regulations, including regulations related to financial reporting, data protection and privacy, tax compliance, labor and employment practices, real estate transactions, anti-money laundering, commercial and electronic banking restrictions, credit card transactions, usury law, consumer protection, marketing, advertising and other general business activities. As the scope of our international operations increases, we may face additional administrative and regulatory costs in managing our business. In addition, unexpected changes in laws and regulations, administrative interpretations of local requirements or legislation, or public remarks by elected officials could negatively affect our operations and profitability.
