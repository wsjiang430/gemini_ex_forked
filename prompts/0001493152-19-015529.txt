Overview
 
We are a development-stage healthcare company that is currently focused on developing new cancer treatments for patients suffering from pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancer. Utilizing our scientific and oncology consultants, we have developed a rational, composite formulation of anti-cancer compounds, which together exert a number of effects designed to control or prevent tumors from recurring and spreading through the body. Our lead product candidate, PRP, is a variation upon our novel formulation and involves proenzymes, the inactive precursors of enzymes. As a result of positive early indications of the anti-cancer effects of our technology, over the last year we have conducted successful pre-clinical studies on PRP and subject to us receiving adequate financing, hope to submit a clinical trial application in the fourth calendar quarter of 2019. We intend to develop our PRP to treat early-stage cancer and pre-cancerous diseases and as a preventative measure for patients at risk of developing cancer based on genetic screening.
Key Research and Development Highlights:
 

● | Potential cancer treatment: We are developing PRP, an intravenous once-daily proenzyme treatment as a therapeutic option in cancer treatment and prevention. PRP is a combination of the pancreatic proenzymes trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Multiple mechanisms of action on cancerous or carcinogenic cells: PRP produces multiple effects on cancerous cells intended to inhibit tumor growth and potentially stop a tumor from spreading through the body. This is in contrast to current cancer treatments that lack sufficient efficacy to achieve a durable clinical response. As our research progresses, we intend to explore further these multiple mechanisms of action in order to identify opportunities to expand our intellectual property portfolio. Furthermore, we hope to uncover the molecular targets of the proenzymes to identify their potential for developing new compounds. 
● | Encouraging data from patient treatment: We began our development efforts by analyzing scientific research undertaken over the last 15 years, including clinical data from patients in the UK and Australia. We concluded that there is at least indirect evidence that a formulation such as PRP may be an effective treatment against cancer and warranted further development. 
● | Pre-Clinical Efficacy Studies: In November 2015, we completed animal efficacy studies in mice through our contract research partner, vivoPharm, demonstrating proof of concept in vivo. During the course of these studies, we discovered a new target therapeutic dose range using proenzymes for treating cancer. That month, we filed a patent application in support of this discovery, as described further herein. 
● | Pre-Clinical Toxicology Studies: In October 2016, we completed an animal study for PRP, in which we evaluated its toxicokinetic parameters as well as its distribution and bioavailability, both before and after repeat dosages. We then initiated a second such study in December 2016. That study escalated the dosage levels in different phases and was completed in April 2017. We observed no major toxicological findings after PRP was administered by intravenous injection once daily throughout the study period. 
● | Anticipated Clinical Trial Application: With the successful completion of the studies described above, we believe we have accumulated sufficient data to establish a safe and effective dosage level for PRP and advance our product development to the clinical stage. We are currently working with our manufacturer to create the finished product that will be part of our Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier to be submitted in connection with our anticipated first clinical trial for PRP, which we expect will be conducted in the UK, Europe or Australia. 
● | Orphan Drug Designation: In June 2017, we received notification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that PRP had been conferred Orphan Drug Designation. This special status is granted when a rare disease or condition is implicated and a potential treatment qualifies under the Orphan Drug Act and applicable FDA regulations. Orphan Drug status qualifies us for various development incentives, including protocol assistance, the potential for research grants, the waiver of future application fees, and tax credits for clinical testing if we choose to host future clinical trials in the U.S.

● | Unique intellectual property: In addition to our pre-clinical studies, we have also focused on building a significant portfolio of intellectual property around the use of proenzymes in the treatment of cancer, identifying new formulations, alternative routes of administration and potential new therapeutic targets. We have filed numerous patent applications relating to PRP, several of which have been granted while others remain pending. In the U.S., we have been issued one patent to date (No. 9,636,359). Our most recent notification of allowance was allowed in the United States in March 2019. Our patent protection extends to both PRP’s mechanism of action and the new compositions of proenzymes.

● | Research and development expenses: During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we have spent $260,335 and $1,825,728, respectively, on research and development expenses. Historically, we have assumed all of the costs associated with research and development. In September 2018, we entered into a two-year joint collaboration agreement with the Jaén University, which is based in Andalucía, Spain, to assist us in expanding our product pipeline by discovering new compounds based on trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. 

Company History
 
We were originally incorporated in Melbourne, Victoria Australia on October 15, 2007 as Propanc PTY LTD and continue to be based in Camberwell, Victoria Australia. Since our inception, substantially all of our operations have been focused on the development of new cancer treatments targeting high-risk patients, particularly cancer survivors, who need a follow-up, non-toxic, long-term therapy designed to prevent the cancer from returning and spreading. We anticipate establishing global markets for our products.
 
On November 23, 2010, our Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware as Propanc Health Group Corporation. In January 2011, to reorganize our Company, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Propanc PTY LTD on a one-for-one basis and Propanc PPY LTD became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective April 20, 2017, we changed our name to “Propanc Biopharma, Inc.” to better reflect our stage of operations and development. On the same date, we also effected a 1-for-250 reverse stock split whereby we (i) decreased the number of authorized shares of our common stock to 100,000,000 (ii) decreased the number of authorized shares of our preferred stock to 1,500,005 and (iii) decreased, by a ratio of 1-for-250 the number of retroactively issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.
 
On January 23, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 100,000,000 to 400,000,000. On September 21, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 400,000,000 to 4,000,000,000. On June 11, 2019, we filed a Certificate of Amendment, as amended, to our Certificate of Incorporation to decrease the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 4,000,000,000 to 100,000,000 in connection with the 1-for-500 reverse stock split that occurred on June 24, 2019.
 
Important Milestones for Propanc
 

● | From the late 1990s, work from other scientists and clinicians, including Dr. Josef Novak in the U.S., and a since retired oncologist from the Czech Republic, Dr. Frantisek Trnka, shed new light on the therapeutic potential of Professor John Beard’s insights. Extensive laboratory work undertaken over a number of years by Novak and Trnka was reported in the journal Anticancer Research in 2005 in the paper entitled Proenzyme Therapy of Cancer. The conclusion of Novak and Trnka from this work was the discovery “that proenzyme therapy mandated first by John Beard nearly one hundred years ago, shows remarkable selective effects that result in growth inhibition of tumor cells with metastatic potential.” Today, these important scientific observations support our view that proenzymes are selective and effective in targeting malignant tumor cells and could become an effective tool in the fight against metastatic cancer.

● | In 2007, Dr. Julian Kenyon, Medical Director of the Dove Clinic in the UK, and Dr. Douglas Mitchell further developed the therapeutic concepts of Beard and identified strategies that could improve upon the therapeutic potential of Beard’s original ground-breaking work. A suppository formulation was developed by Mandeville Medicines in Buckinghamshire, UK, at the request of, and in consultation with, Drs. Kenyon and Mitchell, in an effort to improve on results reported in the literature pertaining to the potential therapeutic use of proenzymes in cancer treatment. Patients were first treated with the suppository formulation in April 2007 at The Dove Clinic in the UK, and in July 2007 at the Opal Clinic in Australia. Drs. Kenyon and Mitchell, through The Dove Clinic and Opal Clinic respectively, treated cancer patients in the United Kingdom and Australia with a suppository formulation of proenzymes. The treatment was undertaken under special UK and Australian regulatory provisions. In the UK it was undertaken under the regulations of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”), designed for patients who have special clinical needs that cannot be met by licensed medicinal products, and in Australia under the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) Special Access Scheme, a mechanism that provides for the import and/or supply of an unapproved therapeutic good for a single patient, on a case by case basis. In both jurisdictions, patients are permitted to receive treatment on an individual basis for compassionate use as long it is supplied by a recognized, licensed manufacturer who is able to meet certain guidelines for unapproved products, and individual case files are maintained for patients should the regulatory authorities require this information. No prior approval was required by either the MHRA or TGA prior to the commencement of treatment. No suppository formulation of the proenzymes was available and it was necessary for a novel suppository formulation to be manufactured specifically for these patients by a suitably licensed manufacturer. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Forty-six late stage cancer patients suffering from a range of malignancies in the UK and Australia received treatment with the proenzyme suppositories over periods of time ranging from one month to in excess of 17 months. Inspired by their observations in clinical practice, Drs. Kenyon and Mitchell resolved to develop proenzyme therapy for cancer patients worldwide. 
● | In late 2007, Drs. Kenyon and Mitchell and Mr. James Nathanielsz, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, developed a strategy to commercialize the newly developed proenzyme formulation, now designated PRP. Propanc PTY LTD. was established in Australia as a vehicle to refine, develop and commercialize novel, patented proenzyme therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. 
● | In 2008, our Scientific Advisory Board (the “Scientific Advisory Board”) comprising Professor John Smyth (Edinburgh University), Professor Klaus Kutz (Bonn University) and Professor Karrar Khan (De Montfort University) was established. Today, the expertise of the Scientific Advisory Board in oncology research and development will be relied upon as we initiate patient trials and advance our products down the requisite regulatory pathways to commercialize our proenzyme therapies. 
● | In 2009, a retrospective review of the patient notes from the 46 patients treated in the UK and Australia with the proenzymes suppositories (as described above) was undertaken by Dr. Kenyon. This report was subject to analysis by Professor Klaus Kutz who, at the time of the review, was an independent consultant in clinical pharmacology and safety, specializing in oncology. Professor Kutz observed that no patients were reported as living for a period less than that predicted by the treating clinician and a number of terminally ill patients lived marginally longer than predicted, particularly those suffering from pancreatic, colorectal, ovarian and gastro-intestinal cancers. As a result of the observations made by Dr. Kenyon and Professor Kutz, we are targeting the development of proenzyme therapy for the treatment of colorectal and pancreatic cancers for clinical trials, and in the future targeting other cancer types as our product candidate progresses to commercialization. 
● | In early 2008, a research collaborative partnership was established with Professor David Tosh at the Center for Regenerative Medicine, Department of Biology and Biochemistry at Bath University, to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the proenzyme formulation is acting, which resulted in us filing two provisional patents a year later. We undertook additional scientific research with Professor Tosh, Dr. Macarena Perán, Department of Health Sciences at Jaén University, and Dr. Juan Antonio Marchal, Biopathology and Regenerative Medicine Institute at Granada University. Important anti-cancer effects of the proenzymes were discovered, including triggering cell necrosis (cell death) and apoptosis (programmed cell death) and significantly, the induction of cell differentiation (i.e. inducing cancer cells to exhibit normal cell behavior). This led to us increasing our intellectual property base and patent new pharmaceutical compositions designed to enhance the effects of proenzymes. Subsequently, two provisional patents were combined into one Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) Application, filed on October 22, 2010 (PCT Application), and then a year later, we completed a 30 month national phase filing deadline for an international patent and commenced entering the national phase in countries around the world. Thus far, we have received grant status in Australia, China, Japan, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa and our application remains under examination in Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Malaysia, Mexico and the Republic of Korea. In the United States, one patent has been issued to date by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (No. 9,636,359) while another remains pending. We also have a second PCT application for our proenzyme composition that is pending as well two other applications filed and pending in Spain.

● | In late 2010, we made important discoveries and scientific observations, resulting in additional composition claims, which were included in the original PCT Application, further protecting the company’s proenzyme formulation. Collaboration with vivoPharm Pty Ltd. (“vivoPharm”), located in Melbourne, Australia, with research facilities in Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States, identified a highly synergistic ratio of the proenzymes when combined together, resulting in increased anti-cancer effects in several tumor cell lines. Furthermore, although α-Amylase was previously included in the early days of enzyme therapy and in the suppository formulation developed by Dr. Kenyon and Dr. Mitchell, after evaluating the synergistic interaction between the two proenzymes and α-Amylase, we concluded that α-Amylase did not contribute to the anti-tumor activity of the formulation, and so it was removed. By 2011, further work completed by vivoPharm confirmed the anti-metastatic effects of the newly combined ratio of the proenzymes in various cell line assays, and anti-angiogenic (inhibition of blood vessel formation) properties of the proenzyme treatment in mice.

● | At this time, we decided to access the U.S. markets in order to raise the capital needed to finance the Company’s proenzyme treatment for future preclinical testing and clinical trials. We incorporated as Propanc Health Group Corporation in the state of Delaware in November 2010 and in January 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Propanc PTY LTD on a one-for-one basis making and Propanc PTY LTD became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In mid-2012, our common stock began trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and it currently trades on OTCQB. 
● | In May 2013, it was observed that proenzymes enforce the re-entry of cancer cells back into normal cellular pathways and this may represent a novel approach to the treatment of cancer. These findings were published in Cellular Oncology, a peer reviewed journal of the International Society for Cellular Oncology. 
● | In 2014, after conducting a detailed strategic review of our scientific and preclinical research, our development team determined that parenteral drug administration is the preferred route for the Company’s lead product, PRP. This approach is expected to maximize results in future patient trials, by ensuring maximum exposure of the drug to the tumor site. 
● | In mid-2015, Dr. Joseph Chalil joined our Scientific Advisory Board as an independent expert to provide advice on the Company’s drug development programs, in particular, our lead product, PRP. Dr. Chalil is a physician and executive at Boehringer Ingelheim, one of the world’s largest privately held pharmaceutical companies. 
● | Between July 2015 and February 2016, several scientific research findings were announced demonstrating significant anti-tumor efficacy in several animal models, including pancreatic and ovarian cancers at higher doses when administering proenzymes by intravenous injection, dramatic suppression of cancer stems cells in cell culture by altering several key pathways involved with invasion and metastasis, and identification of a synergistic response in a broad range of cancer types including kidney, melanoma, brain, prostate, liver, uterine and lung cancers. 
● | In 2016, we added additional members from our partner universities and hospital to our Scientific Advisory Board, including Dr. Macarena Perán, who is currently Reader in Anatomy at the University of Jaén in Spain, Professor Juan Antonio Marchal Corrales, Professor of Anatomy and Embryology at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Granada, and Dr. Maria García, Head of Translational Research at the University Hospital of Granada.

● | In August 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement and Quality Assurance Agreement with Amatsigroup NV, formally known as Q-Biologicals NV, a contract manufacturing organization located in Belgium. Pursuant to the Manufacturing Services Agreement, Amatsigroup produces for us certain drug substances and product containing certain enzymes at its facility in Belgium. We use these substances and products for development purposes, including but not limited to future clinical trials.

We then initiated a second such study in December 2016. That study escalated the dosage levels in different phases and was completed in April 2017. We observed no major toxicological findings after PRP was administered by intravenous injection once daily throughout the study period. 
● | On April 20, 2017, we changed our corporate name to “Propanc Biopharma, Inc.” to better reflect our stage of operations and development. 
● | In June 2017, we received notification from the FDA that PRP had been granted Orphan Drug Designation, a special status that will enable us to qualify for tax credits for our future clinical trials, among other benefits. 
● | In October 2017, we published key findings relating to a combination of two proenzymes trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen A with potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in Scientific Reports, a peer reviewed scientific journal covering all areas of the natural sciences. It was concluded that PRP could have relevant oncological clinical applications for the treatment of advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma and advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. 
● | In February 2018, we announced allowance of our key patent application from the European Patent Office (EPO) covering a pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer comprising trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen within the European Union. The allowed patent application is the first approval for the Company in the EU, which protects the Company’s lead product candidate, PRP, a solution for once-daily intravenous administration of a combination of two pancreatic proenzymes trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. 
● | In March 2018, we completed the successful reproduction run of the manufacturing process for the Company’s two drug substances trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. The successful reproduction run demonstrated scalability of our proprietary manufacturing process to enable routine production of the two active substances for PRP. The process was developed in collaboration with a European Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) experienced in the production of biopharmaceuticals. 
● | In July 2018, we entered national phase for two of our key patent applications from our intellectual property portfolio. The first patent application, which entered national phase in July 2018, describes a method to eradicate cancer stem cells, and a second patent application, covering proenzyme compositions for the treatment of solid tumors, completed national phase entry mid-July 2018. National phase is a process whereby applicants file a patent application in each individual jurisdiction or country, according to where intellectual property protection is sought. 
● | In September 2018, we entered into a two-year collaboration agreement with the University of Jaén to provide certain research services to us. In consideration of such services, we agreed to pay the university approximately 52,000 Euros ($60,762 USD) in year one and a maximum of 40,000 Euros ($46,740 USD) in year two. Additionally, in exchange for full ownership of the intellectual property we agreed to pay royalties of 2% of net revenues to the University. 
● | In December 2018, we announced that our foundation patent application has been granted by the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Design and Trademarks, India. The foundation patent, which covers our lead product candidate, PRP, pioneers the discovery of a pharmaceutical composition for treating cancer via a combination of trypsinogen and/or chymotrypsinogen pancreatic proenzymes. As of June 30, 2019, the foundation patent has been granted in the United States, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Turkey, United Kingdom, Australia, China, Japan, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, South Africa, Mexico, Republic of Korea and India. It is presently under examination in Brazil and Canada.

● | In January 2019, we announced that a cooperation agreement has been entered into between the University of Jaén and our Company to commence the POP1 joint drug discovery program to be co-funded by both parties. The agreement coincides with the appointment of research scientist, Mr. Aitor González, to lead the drug discovery and research activities over the next 3 to 4 years. The objective of the program is to identify and develop suitable backup compounds to our lead product candidate, PRP. As part of the agreement, Macarena Perán, Ph.D. and Julian Kenyon, M.D. have been appointed as joint supervisors, representing the University and our Company, respectively. The program involves advancing new compounds through a drug screening process, followed by preclinical and early stage clinical development. As the drug candidate progresses along the development pathway, the collaboration will also involve the Universities of Granada and Jaén, as well as Granada and Almeria Hospitals, which are members of FIBAO, a Public Health Foundation, based in Granada, Spain, committed to assisting commercial partners with the development and commercialization of innovative technologies designed to benefit humankind.

● | In March 2019, we announced that we received a notification of allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) confirming both methods of treatment and composition of matter claims involving trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen for our foundation patent in the U.S. that covers PRP. The notification of allowance from the USPTO signifies that a USPTO examiner has determined that PRP’s patent application is complete and meets all relevant statutory requirements. 
● | In March 2019, we announced that we have initiated development of a bio-analytical assay intended to quantify the active ingredients of RPR in preparation for human trails planned for 2019. The necessary work performed in connection with this development will be conducted by a specialist Contract Research Organization with extensive knowledge in the development of functional assays for different bio-therapeutics. 
● | Today, after deepening our scientific knowledge of the anti-cancer effects of proenzymes through our ongoing efforts with our research partners and strengthening our intellectual property portfolio by filing our patents in countries around the world, we believe we are ready to undertake human clinical trials and subject to receiving adequate financing, we hope to submit a clinical trial application in the fourth quarter of 2019 calendar year. 

The Problem
 
In the early phases of tumor progression, cancer cells multiply near the site where their predecessors first began uncontrolled proliferation. The result, usually over a long period of time, is a primary tumor mass. Tumors often need to reach a large size before they make themselves apparent to the individual concerned, or the clinician screening for them.
 
Eventually, tumors of substantial size may begin to compromise the functioning of organs in which they have arisen and begin to evoke symptoms. In many cases, the effects on normal tissue function come from the physical pressure exerted by the expanding tumor masses. For example, large tumors in the colon may obstruct digestion products through the lumen, or in the lungs, airways may be compromised.
 
As dangerous and threatening as these primary tumors are, they are ultimately responsible for only about 10% of deaths. A far greater threat often arises for the patient, even after a primary tumor has been identified and removed. This threat involves cancerous growths that are discovered at sites far removed from the locations in their bodies where their primary tumors first appeared. These cancerous growths, called metastases, are responsible for approximately 90% of patient deaths from cancer. Metastases are formed by cancer cells that have left the primary tumor mass and traveled by the body’s blood and lymphatic vessels (a vein-like vessel carrying lymph, or white blood cells, from the tissues) to seek new sites and form new colonies. For example, breast cancers often spawn metastatic colonies in many tissues throughout the body including the brain, liver, bones, and lungs.

For primary tumors that have not yet metastasized, current treatments for cancer can be effective in initially reducing tumor burden. However, for many forms of cancer, current treatments lack sufficient efficacy to achieve a long lasting clinical response. Therefore, a vast majority of patients who succumb to cancer are killed by tumors that have metastasized. According to the National Cancer Institute’s SEER Cancer Statistics Review (2001 – 2007), of the patients diagnosed with late stage metastatic breast cancer, only 23% are expected to live longer than five years. This is compared to a 98% five-year survival rate for an early stage breast cancer patient when the cancer is confined to the primary site.
 
The invasion-metastasis cascade
 
The great majority of life threatening cancers occur in epithelial tissues, yielding carcinomas. Epithelial cells generally have a multi-sided, uniform shape. They have well defined contact points with neighboring cells and a strong attachment to the underlying connective tissue, or stroma, which creates a framework for solid tumors in the body. Separating the two is the specialized type of extracellular matrix, known as the basement membrane.
 
By definition, carcinomas that originate on the epithelial side of the basement membrane are considered to be benign; as long as the cells forming them remain on the same side. However, many carcinomas acquire the ability to penetrate the basement membrane, and individual cancer cells or groups of cancer cells begin to invade the stroma. This mass of cells is now reclassified as malignant. Often, many pathologists and surgeons reserve the label “cancer” for those epithelial tumors that have acquired this invasive ability.
 
Thereafter, carcinoma cells may invade into lymphatic or blood microvessels. The latter may then transport these cancer cells to distant sites in the body where they may be trapped and subsequently form new metastases.



It is important to note, that even before cells penetrate the basement membrane, they often stimulate angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) on the stromal side of the membrane, by expressing angiogenic proteins through the porous barrier. Not only does this enhance the ability of malignant cells to circulate into the blood, but also provides an important feedback loop for the cancer cell to maintain its invasiveness.

Understanding the mechanism by which benign cells change to a malignant state is therefore pivotal to developing anti-cancer treatments that have sufficient efficacy to achieve a long lasting clinical response.
 
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition and associated loss of E-cadherin expression enable carcinoma cells to become invasive.
 
Epithelial cells can undergo a transformation to a different cell type, called mesenchymal cells, through a process called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (“EMT”). Mesenchymal cells have an elongated spindle shape, lack orderly contacts with neighboring cells and can survive without contact with a surface or connective tissue. The EMT process is a series of events that normally occur during the development of tissues and organs prior to birth, and also apply to normal wound healing processes. However, the same EMT process can also be applied to epithelial cancer cells, or carcinomas. When epithelial carcinoma cells residing in a solid tumor undergo the EMT process, the resulting mesenchymal cancer cells can invade through local barriers and metastasize to other parts of the body.
 
In addition to becoming invasive and motile after undergoing the EMT process, the resulting mesenchymal cells have significantly increased resistance to current cancer treatments. For example, in Cancer Research in 2005, it was reported that lung cancer cells expressing mesenchymal biomarkers appeared to be resistant to Tarceva and other targeted anti-cancer agents when transplanted into mice.
 
At the center of this critical process for transforming benign cells into carcinomas, is the protein Epithelial Cadherin (“E-Cadherin”). In normal cells, E-cadherin is located in the membrane and involved in maintaining cell to cell contact, which is critical to normal function and structure of epithelial tissues. The individual E-Cadherin molecules are attached to the actin (scaffolding, or cytoskeleton structure) within the cell, anchored by β-catenin, a protein which helps form the junction between epithelial cells. As well as forming an anchor between epithelial cells, β-catenin is also involved in gene transcription, a process by which DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid) is converted into RNA (ribose nucleic acid) within the nucleus of a cell for the purpose of producing new proteins normally associated with routine cell function.
 


In the case of tumors, when cells become invasive, E-Cadherin expression decreases substantially, and β-catenin becomes free within the cell, which may then migrate to the nucleus and induce expression of the EMT program. Furthermore, once cells undergo an EMT, they begin to produce their own cytokines (cell signaling molecules), such as Transforming Growth Factor β, (“TGF-β”). This protein plays a critical multi-functional role in promoting angiogenesis, immunosuppression (suppressing the immune system from recognizing and attacking cancer cells), and maintaining their mesenchymal cell structure for prolonged periods via a feedback mechanism. Studies also suggest that TGF-β works with β-catenin to cause epithelial cancer cells to undergo an EMT.

A study in the British Journal of Cancer in 2011 demonstrated that in cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) cell lines, treatment of TGF-β increased cell migration, invasion and mesenchymal changes. Furthermore, expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin was measured from resected (cut out) specimens from extra-hepatic (outside the liver) cholangiocarcinoma patients. Patients with low E-cadherin expression had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with high E-cadherin expression. They concluded the cadherin switch via TGF-β induced EMT in extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma leads to cancer progression.
 
Conversely, in studies of several types of carcinoma cells that had lost E-cadherin expression, re-expression of this protein strongly suppressed the invasiveness and motility of these cancer cells.
 
Together, these observations indicate that E-Cadherin levels is a key determinant of the biological behavior of epithelial cancer cells and that the cell to cell contact constructed by E-cadherin molecules impede invasiveness and hence metastasis.
 
Our Solution
 
Our solution is to develop and commercialize a long-term therapy to prevent tumor recurrence and metastases, the main cause of patient death from cancer. We believe this problem can be addressed by developing a proenzyme formulation specifically targeting malignant carcinoma cells to create a long lasting clinical benefit to the patient.
Propanc’s Theory Proenzymes Regulate Cell Proliferation
 
More than 100 years ago, Professor John Beard, a comparative embryologist, made an observation that the pancreas develops in most vertebrates at the time when the placenta begins to slow its rate of growth. He hypothesized that enzymes produced by the developing pancreatic gland curtail trophoblastic invasion (a rare condition in which abnormal cells grow inside the uterus from tissue that forms after conception) and suggested that pancreatic extracts should have a similar inhibitory effect on invasive tumors.
 
Subsequently in the late 1990s, after following Professor Beard’s recommendations, Drs. Novak and Trnka hypothesized that administration of proenzymes, rather than the enzymes, was of crucial importance to the clinical effectiveness of the treatment approach first developed by Professor Beard, and that the precursor nature of the active enzymes may offer protection against numerous serpins (proteins which can inhibit proenzymes) in the blood.

As knowledge of tumor cell and molecular cell biology has increased over the years, our scientists and research partners have made important scientific discoveries identifying that proenzymes suppress the EMT program and induce cell differentiation, i.e., return cancerous cells towards normal cell behavior, or a benign state.
 
After more than 100 years, the initial observations made by Professor Beard may have a potential common link between embryogenesis and cancer, by which cells are able to become motile and invasive, via the EMT program, where the administration of proenzymes may regulate cell proliferation as a means to controlling carcinomas.
 
PRP
 
Our lead product, PRP, is a novel, patented formulation consisting of two proenzymes, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, combined at a ratio of one-to-six (1:6), to be administered intravenously. After establishing proof of concept in vivo as described earlier, supplemented by laboratory research at the Universities of Jaén and Granada on the mechanism of action of the proenzyme mixture, evidence suggests PRP may be effective against a range of solid tumors.
Selectivity
 
Research published by Novak and Trnka in Anticancer Research (2005) suggests that the proenzymes in our product, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, exhibit specificity for tumor cells and not normal cells. Once activated, they in turn activate Protease Activated Receptors Type 2 (“PAR2”), which are located on the cell membrane and involved with cancer cell proliferation. Activation of PAR2 results in a cascade of intracellular activities, including activation of a major component of the cell which controls its structure and architecture, the actin cytoskeleton. In a cancer cell, proenzymes have the effect of converting globular actin into filamentous actin, which causes the cell structure to collapse and induce cell death. This reduces tumor volume and is often seen in clinical practice.
 
Anti-Cancer Effects and Mechanism of Action
 
PRP consists of proenzymes which are known to influence a number of pathways critical for cancer cells to invade, grow and metastasize. Research published in collaboration with our research partners at Jaén and Granada Universities in the Journal of Cellular Oncology in 2013 shows the clinical benefits of PRP appear to result from enhanced differentiation of tumor cells, which inhibits proliferation and consequently reduces their ability to invade and metastasize.
 
Specifically, the research showed that proenzymes:
 

● | induce a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth, triggering apoptosis and cell necrosis; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | enhance expression of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and β-catenin; 
● | decrease expression of EMT transcription factors responsible for coding specific gene sequences from DNA, associated with TGF-β cell signaling pathways; and 
● | induce malignant cells to differentiate to benign forms. 

 
Once activated, proenzymes influence the micro-immune environment around the cell, altering a number of pathways critical for supporting cancer cell growth, invasion and metastasis. This includes interacting with proteinases and cell signaling pathways in the extracellular matrix, whilst also interacting directly with cell surface proteins that effect the internal pathways of the cancer cell, triggering re-expression of epithelial markers, reducing important EMT markers, and inducing a series of cellular activities which alters the cancer cell’s morphology (structure) from a malignant to a benign state.

Planned Clinical Development
 
PRP recently completed preclinical development. A First-In-Human (FIH), Phase Ib study in patients with advanced solid tumors, evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor efficacy of PRP is planned to commence in the first half of 2020 calendar year in a jurisdiction to be selected by us, subject to us receiving adequate financing, and is hoped to be completed within twelve months. The study will be an open-label, multicenter, non-comparative study of PRP administered at increasing dose levels, with once daily intravenous injections over a 28-day cycle, with at least 20 and up to 40 patients enrolled.
 
The Phase Ib study is planned to be followed by two open Phase IIa studies evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor efficacy of PRP administered intravenously to patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, or to patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who have failed prior anti-cancer therapy regimen. These studies are envisioned to start in parallel, shortly after the FIH Phase IIa study, and are hoped to be finalized in 2021. Both studies will be open, multicenter phase II studies measuring overall survival of patients having received once daily intravenous administrations of PRP.
 
Preclinical Development
 
We have extensive in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating the anti-tumor efficacy of a novel proenzyme formulation consisting of a combination of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen in a synergistic ratio. The preclinical work was undertaken in collaboration with our contract research organization, vivoPharm, in both Melbourne, Australia and Hummelstown, PA, United States, together with universities we partnered with, including the Biopathology and Regenerative Medicine Institute, Center for Biomedical Research, at the University of Granada in Granada, Spain, and the Department of Health Sciences at the University of Jaén in Jaén, Spain. We funded both vivoPharm and the universities to carry out this research and retained the intellectual property rights within the field relating to any discoveries based on the mechanism of action and anti-tumor effects of the proenzymes.
 
The following preclinical development activities have been undertaken to date:
 

● | We tested the anti-proliferative effects of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen in 24 cancer cell lines and determined a synergistic ratio of 1:6, which we used to formulate PRP; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We evaluated the in vitro anti-angiogenic effects of PRP, by soft-agar formation assay, and in vivo using the AngioChamber™ assay, which is based on the normal physiological process of wound healing, to promote fibrous capsule formation around an implanted growth factor-releasing Teflon chamber; 
● | To analyze the anti-metastatic effects of proenzymes, we studied the effects of PRP in cell invasion, cell migration, and in the modulation of EMT related genes in pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells; and 
● | We also performed in vivo a pharmacokinetic study and assessed the anti-tumor efficacy of PRP in murine cancer models. To accomplish this, we treated mice that were orthotopically inoculated with A2780 human ovarian cancer cells, or with Pan02 mouse pancreatic tumor cells, with PRP. 

Determination of Optimal Proenzyme Ratio
 
In this study, we determined first the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen to measure their effect as single test articles in an extended panel of 24 human cancer cell lines. The IC50 values of trypsinogen ranged from 2.5 to 17.5 mg/ml and from 1.4 to 25.2 mg/ml for chymotrypsinogen. The IC50 values of trypsinogen were the basis for the calculation of concentration ratios for the combination of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen at 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, and 1:10. At these ratios, the growth inhibitory properties of the combination were evaluated in 24 cancer cell lines. Based on the coefficient of drug interaction (CDI) values, the combination of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen demonstrated greater growth inhibition at ratios of 1:4, 1:6, and 1:8, compared to the 1:1 ratio in most cell lines tested. Finally, a ratio of trypsinogen to chymotrypsinogen of 1:6 was determined to be the optimal formulation and used for later experiments.

Determination of the Coefficient of Drug Interaction
 
The representative graphs show an optimal pro-enzyme synergistic ratio of the Trypsinogen to Chymotrypsinogen as 1:6
 


Anti-angiogenic efficacy of pancreatic proenzyme formulation
 
To determine whether PRP affects angiogenesis, we used a soft-agar tube formation assay. Dispersed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) organized into clusters after three hours and began to form tube-like structures after five hours that were clearly evident after 24 hours. In contrast, PRP treated HUVECs presented a marked reduction in the number and length of closed capillary tubes in a concentration dependent manner, with a total disappearance of the structures after treatment with trypsinogen to chymotrypsinogen (T/C) 0.07/0.42 mg/ml.
 

15
--

 


To assess if the inhibition of the tubule-like structures formation could be due to cell death caused by PRP treatment, CellTracker Green/CMFDA staining was used to identify viable cells. Both control and PRP treated cells showed green staining, indicating that the inhibition of cellular cords was independent from cell viability.
 

Furthermore, quantification of the number of capillary-like structures at different areas of the cell revealed a dramatic and significant difference between the number of structures formed by non-treated cells when compared with PRP-treated cells (p <0.01 vs. Control).
 
The anti-angiogenic effect of PRP was additionally investigated in vivo using the AngioChamber™ assay, a model used to assess the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatments by measuring fibrous capsule formation in mice. In this assay the inclusion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the chamber supports the induction of blood vessels development and formation of a fibrous capsule. AngioChamber™ were excised from all post-mortem mice on the termination day, 24 hours following final treatment (Day 5).
 
The results show that fibrous capsule formation was significantly greater in the vehicle control group with bFGF captured in the chamber (Group 2, Induction Control) than in the vehicle control group without bFGF loaded into the chamber (Group 1, Baseline Control) (p<0.05) indicating that bFGF adequately and significantly stimulated capsule formation. Furthermore, treatment with PRP (Group 3) resulted in a significant reduction in angiogenesis compared to the induction control (Group 2), as indicated by the difference in capsule weight (p < 0.05) with a 57% of fibrous capsule formation inhibition. Thus, PRP inhibits fibrous capsule formation showing significant in vivo anti-angiogenic effects.

Anti-invasion, anti-migration and anti-EMT effect of PRP
 
To analyze the in vitro anti-metastatic effect of the proenzyme treatment, we studied the effect of PRP in cell invasion, cell migration and the modulation of EMT related genes in cancer cells. First, to evaluate the effect of PRP on cell migration, a key event in carcinogenesis, we performed a wound-healing assay on human pancreatic BxPC3 and human ovarian A2780 cells. Migration is defined as the directed movement of cells on a substrate such as plastic plates occurring on 2D surfaces.
 
Results show that non-treated cells migrated faster to close the gap of a scratch in the cell monolayer than PRP treated cells. PRP significantly reduced cell migration of pancreatic BxPC3 cells and compared with control cells even enhanced the width of the wound.
 


Although the A2780 ovarian tumor cell line does not grow forming a homogeneous monolayer like BxPC3, it can be observed that PRP treatment significantly reduces the ability of the ovarian cells to migrate. Data showed significant cell migration inhibition after 24 hours and 48 hours of treatment with PRP compared to control cells.
 
Secondly, we tested the inhibitory effect of the proenzyme formulation on cell invasion of colon and pancreatic tumor cells. Invasion is defined as cell movement through an extracellular 3D matrix. The principle of this assay is based on two medium containing chambers separated by a porous membrane through which cells transmigrate. Here, we tested different concentrations of PRP on MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic and HCT-15 colon human cancer cell lines. PRP showed a marked and significantly dose-dependent inhibition of invasion in both cell lines. Total inhibition of cell migration was achieved from PRP concentrations of T/C 0.015/0.093 mg/ml and so on with the other increasing concentrations tested.

Finally, to investigate whether the exposure of PRP has a potential regulation in the transcriptional machinery that drives EMT in cancer cells, expression of EMT genes were studied in BxPC3 pancreatic and A2780 ovarian human cancer cells. EMT markers in both BxPC3 and A2780 cells were affected by PRP treatment at T/C 0.07/0.42 mg/ml. Results show that PRP treatment increased the expression of E-Cadherin (0.4 fold) (p < 0.05), whilst reduced the expressions of N-cadherin, Slug and vimentin (0.9, 0.5 and 0.6 fold, respectively) (p < 0.01) in BxPC3 cells.
 
In addition, PRP significantly up-regulated the expression of E-Cadherin (0.9 fold) (p < 0.01) and significantly down-regulated the expression of N-cadherin and Slug (0.4 and 0.6 fold, respectively) (p < 0.01) and induced a slight, but not significant, decrease of vimentin expression in A2780 cells.
 


PRP pharmacokinetic study
 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and organ distribution of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, non-tumor bearing female athymic Nude-Foxn1nu mice were treated with IRDye® 800CW labeled trypsinogen (5 mg/kg) plus unlabeled trypsinogen (50 mg/kg), or IRDye® 800 CW labeled chymotrypsinogen (7 mg/kg) plus unlabeled Chymotrypsinogen (300 mg/kg). Animals were euthanized at specified time-points post-dose and plasma along with organ homogenates was prepared, then imaged via IVIS imaging system.
 

18
--


Fluorescence was measured in organ homogenates. Mice treated with labeled T, presented a fluorescence peak in all organs between 15 minutes and 2 hours post-dose. While mice treated with labeled C showed the maximum fluorescent emission between 15 minutes and 6 hours post-dose. For both highest readings were observed in the kidneys and liver. Maximum levels of both IRDye®800CW labeled trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen A in mouse plasma occurred at 15 minutes post dose (7.5 and 72.2 ìg/ml, respectively). Levels of both IRDye® 800CW labeled proenzymes decreased rapidly after this time.
  


Anti-tumor efficacy of PRP in orthotropic mice models
 
The effect of the proenzyme formulation PRP at different doses on tumor weight in orthotopically implanted pancreatic and ovary tumors was assessed. In the pancreatic tumor control group, there was significant (*P < 0.05) reduction in mean tumor weight in animals treated for 26 days with trypsinogen/chymotrypsinogen at 83.3/500 mg/kg (30.2 mg; 85.9% inhibition) compared with control (PBS; 214.8 mg), but not between trypsinogen/chymotrypsinogen at 27.5/165 mg/kg (196.5 mg; 8.5 % inhibition) and the control (as shown in the figure below).
 


Furthermore, ovary tumor-bearing mice (as shown in the figure below) showed a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in mean tumor weight in animals treated for 21 days with two different doses of trypsinogen/chymotrypsinogen, 9.1/54 mg/kg and 27.5/165 mg/kg, compared with control (PBS). The mean weight of control group tumors was 2062.2 mg while the treated groups presented a mean tumor weight of 1074.2 mg and 957.3 respectively, ranging in a 50% tumor inhibition (52% - 46%).

The PRP Formulation
 
Oral pancreatic enzymes have been administered previously in a variety of circumstances and are in current clinical use in conditions where the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient enzymes for the digestion of food. A number of oral pancreatic enzyme products are presently approved in the U.S. for use in patients who do not produce enough pancreatic enzymes. Approved pancreatic enzyme products include Pancreaze™ from Johnson & Johnson, CREON® from Abbott Laboratories, and ULTRASE® from Axcan Pharma US.
 
PRP is a combination of two proenzymes, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, specifically formulated within a specific ratio (1:6, as described above) designed to synergistically enhance their anti-cancer effects based on the mechanism of action. Patent protection for PRP has been secured in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, and continues to be sought for similar compositions and mechanisms of action.
 
Oral enzymes have also been investigated previously for the treatment of cancer and, while generating encouraging results, their widespread use has been hampered by the very large quantities that have been considered necessary for effective treatment – 130 or more tablets per day. The high dose used with oral delivery is considered necessary due to the oral enzymes being broken down in the stomach and duodenum, the first part of the small intestine and very little actually being absorbed into the general circulation. By administering a proenzyme parenterally, and using a specific proenzyme formulation, the normal breakdown of the enzymes when taken orally is avoided and the drug can potentially be absorbed into the general circulation intact. It is also suggested that proenzymes are resistant to inactivation by numerous protein digesting enzymes, like serpins, which are circulating in the blood. Together with our scientific consultants, we believe that the development of a parenteral proenzyme formulation will lead to improved efficacy in the treatment of cancer compared with oral enzyme preparations, and will substantially reduce the dose in comparison to that used previously for oral enzyme therapy for the treatment of cancer.
 
Target Indications
 
The management of cancer differs widely, with a multitude of factors impacting the choice of treatment strategy. Some of those factors include:
 

● | the type of tumor, usually defined by the tissue in the body from which it originated; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the extent to which it has spread beyond its original location; 
● | the availability of treatments, driven by multiple factors including cost, drugs approved, local availability of suitable facilities, etc.; 
● | regional and geographic differences; 


20
--


● | whether the primary tumor is amenable to surgery, either as a potentially curative procedure, or as a palliative one; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the balance between potential risks and potential benefits from the various treatments and, probably most importantly, the patient’s wishes. 

 
For many patients with solid cancers, such as breast, ovarian, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer, surgery is frequently the first treatment option, often followed by first line chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. While hopefully such procedures are curative, in many instances the tumor returns, and second line treatment strategies are chosen in an effort to achieve a degree of control over the tumor. In most instances, the benefit is temporary, and eventually the point is reached where the patient’s tumor either fails to adequately respond to treatment, or the treatment has unacceptable toxicity which severely limits its usefulness.
 
Should the planned Phase I, II and III clinical trials confirm the efficacy of PRP, along with the favorable safety and tolerability profile suggested by pre-clinical studies conducted to date, we believe our product will have utility in a number of clinical situations including:
 

● | in the early stage management of solid tumors, most likely as part of a multi-pronged treatment strategy in combination with existing therapeutic interventions; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | as a product that can be administered long term for patients following standard treatment approaches, such as surgery, or chemotherapy, in order to prevent or delay recurrence; and 
● | as a preventative measure for patients at risk of developing cancer based on genetic screening. 

 
In the near term as part of our planned Phase I, II and III clinical trials, we plan to target patients with solid tumors, most likely ovarian and pancreatic, for whom other treatment options have been exhausted. This is a common approach by which most new drugs for cancer are initially tested. Once efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in this patient population, exploration of the potential utility of the drug in earlier stage disease can be undertaken, together with investigation of the drug’s utility in other types of cancers, such as gastro-esophageal tumors, colon or rectal carcinoma might be conducted. A Phase II study in a back-up indication, such as advanced therapy refractant prostate cancer will also be considered. This indication is based on positive preclinical pharmacology studies.
 
Development Strategy
 
Our goal is to undertake early stage clinical development of PRP through to a significant value inflection point, where the commercial attractiveness of a drug in development, together with a greater likelihood of achieving market authorization, may attract potential interest from licensees seeking to acquire new products. Such value inflection points in the context of cancer drugs are typically at the point where formal, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated either ‘efficacy’ or ‘proof of concept’ – typically meaning that there is controlled clinical trial evidence that the drug is effective in the proposed target patient population, has an acceptable safety profile, and is suitable for further development. From a ‘big picture’ perspective, it is our intention to progress the development of our technology through the completion of our planned Phase IIa clinical trials and then to seek a licensee for further development beyond that point.
 
As part of that commercial strategy, we will:
 

● | continue research and development to build our existing intellectual property portfolio, and to seek new, patentable discoveries; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | seek to ensure all product development is undertaken in a manner that makes its products approvable in the major pharmaceutical markets, including the U.S., Europe, the UK, Australia and Japan; 
● | aggressively pursue the protection of our technology through all means possible, including patents in all major jurisdictions, and potentially trade secrets; and 
● | make strategic acquisitions to acquire new companies that have products or services that complement our future goals.

Development Plan and Milestones
 
PRP
 
We plan to progress PRP down a conventional early stage clinical development pathway for:
 

● | regulatory and/or ethics approval to conduct a Phase Ib study, and submit it with the applicable government agency for approval; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase IIa multiple escalating dose studies to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PRP administered intravenously to patients. 

 
We are currently evaluating Australia, UK and Europe as the potential destination where we may commence the Phase Ib trial. In particular, we are closely evaluating Australia because of its research and development tax incentives, as well as a simplified regulatory environment. As part of such incentives, eligible companies conducting clinical trials in Australia may receive up to 43.5% “cash-back” benefit in the form of a refund of their qualified research and development costs and expenses. We are evaluating all options to conduct our planned clinical trials in the most cost-efficient manner, while striving to minimize dilution to our stockholders.
 
We anticipate reaching the Phase IIa proof of concept milestone in approximately three to four years, subject to regulatory approval in Europe, and the results from our research and development and licensing activities.
 
Our overhead and expenses are likely to increase from its current level as PRP progresses down the development pathway. This increase will be driven by the need to increase our internal resources in order to effectively manage our research and development activities.
 
Anticipated timelines
 
Below is the timeline and a detailed discussion of our anticipated milestones and steps that we plan to take in preparation for our planned Phase Ib clinical trial.
 

22
--




In fourth quarter of 2019 calendar year, we anticipate the submission of the Clinical Trial Application for PRP in a jurisdiction to be determined by us that would suit the best interests of the trial and our Company. We anticipate receiving approval of such application in the first calendar quarter of 2020. Following the clinical trial application, we plan to commence our Study Preparation, including CRO Selection and Contracts, Analytical Lab Selection Contracts and Trial Sites Selection and Contracts. In connection with the Clinical Trial Application, this product will be part of our Investigation Medicinal Product Dossier, Study Protocol and Investigator’s Brochure. In the first half of 2020 calendar year, we hope to complete the Study Preparation with the Preparation of Logistics and Trial Sites Initiation Visits and complete our clinical trial application review.
 
Commencing in the first half of 2020 calendar year, we intend to initiate a Phase Ib study in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors and the anticipated costs will be approximately $6.5 million. We will need to raise additional financing to fund our planned Phase I, II and III clinical trials and for working capital.
 
Financial Objectives
 
Multiple factors, many of which are outside of our control, can impact our ability to achieve our target objectives within the planned time and budgetary constraints. Subject to these caveats, our objective is to complete our planned Phase IIa study for PRP within the proposed budget.
Corporate Strategy
 
We primarily outsource services, skills and expertise to third parties as required to achieve our scientific and corporate objectives. As the business grows and gains more personnel, outsourcing will continue to be the preferred model, where fixed and variable costs are carefully managed on a project-by-project basis. This means our research and development activities are carried out by third parties. Additional third parties with specific expertise in research, compound screening and manufacturing (including raw material suppliers) have been contracted as required.
 
Our initial focus is to organize, coordinate and finance the various parts of our drug development pipeline. New personnel will be carefully introduced into our Company over a period of time as our research and development activities expand. They will have specific expertise in product development, manufacture and formulation, regulatory affairs, toxicology, clinical operations and business development (including intellectual property management, licensing and other corporate activities).
 

23
--


In the first instance, additional clinical management and development expertise is likely to be required for our lead product. Therefore, we anticipate an increase in employees in order to effectively manage our contractors as the projects progress down the development pathway.
 
This outsourcing strategy is common in the biotechnology sector, and is an efficient way to obtain access to the necessary skills required to progress a project, in particular as the required skills change as the project progresses from discovery, through manufacturing and non-clinical development and into clinical trials. We anticipate that we will continue to use this model, thereby retaining the flexibility to contract in the appropriate resource as and when required.
 
We intend to seek and identify potential licensing partners for our product candidates as they progress through the various development stages, reaching certain milestones and value inflection points. If a suitable licensee is identified, a potential licensing deal could consist of payments for certain milestones, plus royalties from future sales if the product is able to receive approval from the relevant regulatory authorities where future product sales are targeted. We intend to seek and identify potential licensees based on the initial efficacy data from Phase II clinical trials. To accomplish this objective, we have commenced discussions with potential partners in our current preclinical phase of development.
 
As part of our overall expansion strategy, from time to time, we investigate potential intellectual property acquisition opportunities to expand our product portfolio. While our initial focus is on the development of PRP as the lead product candidate, potential product candidates may also be considered for future preclinical and clinical development. These potential opportunities have arisen from other research and development organizations, which either own existing intellectual property or are currently developing new intellectual property, which may be of interest to us. These opportunities are possible new cancer treatments that are potentially less toxic than existing treatment approaches and are able to fill an existing gap in the treatment process, such as a systemic de-bulking method which could reduce the size and threat of metastases to a more manageable level for late stage cancer patients. We believe these potential treatment approaches will be complementary to existing treatment regimens and our existing product candidate, PRP. No formal approaches have been made at this stage and it is unknown whether we will engage in this discussion in the near future. However, we remain hopeful that as PRP progresses further down the development pathway, future opportunities may arise to use the expertise of our management and scientific personnel for future prospective research and development projects.
 
Current Operations
 
We are at a pre-revenue stage. We do not know when, if ever, we will be able to commercialize our products and begin generating revenue. We are focusing our efforts on organizing, coordinating and financing the various aspects of the drug research and development program outlined earlier in this document. In order to commercialize our products, we must complete preclinical development, Phase Ib, IIa and IIb clinical trials in Europe, the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia or elsewhere, and satisfy the applicable regulatory authority that PRP is safe and effective. If the results from the Phase II trials are convincing, we will seek conditional approval from the regulatory authorities sooner. Therefore, from the time we commence clinical trials, we estimate that this will take approximately three to four years if we seek conditional approval upon completion of Phase II trials, or up to seven years if we determine that Phase III trials are needed. As described previously, when we advance our development projects sufficiently down the development pathway and achieve a major increase in value, such as obtaining interim efficacy data from Phase II clinical trials, we will seek a suitable licensing partner to complete the remaining development activities, obtain regulatory approval and market the product.
Current Therapies
 
We are developing a therapeutic solution for the treatment of patients with advanced stages of cancer targeting solid tumors, which is cancer that originates in organs or tissues other than bone marrow or the lymph system. Common cancer types classified as solid tumors include lung, colorectal, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and liver cancers. In each of these indications, there is a large market opportunity to capitalize on the limitations of current therapies.

24
--


Current therapeutic options for the treatment of cancer offer, at most, a few months of extra life or tumor stabilization. Some experts believe that drugs that kill most tumor cells do not affect cancer stem cells, which can regenerate the tumor (e.g. chemotherapy). Studies are revealing the genetic changes in cells that cause cancer and spur its growth. This research is providing scientific researchers with many potential targets for drugs. Tumor cells, however, can develop resistance to drugs.
 
Limitations of Current Therapies
 
PRP was developed because of the limitation of current cancer therapies. While surgery is often safe and effective for early stage cancer, many standard therapies for late stage cancer urgently need improvement; current treatments generally provide modest benefits, and frequently cause significant adverse effects. Our focus is to provide oncologists and their patients with therapies for metastatic cancer which are more effective than current therapies, and which have a substantially reduced side effect profile.
 
While progress has been made within the oncology sector in developing new treatments, the overall cancer death rate has only improved by 7% over the last 30 years. Most of these new treatments have some limitations, such as:
 

● | significant toxic effects; 
--+-------------------------------
● | expense; and 
● | limited survival benefits. 

 
We believe that our treatment will provide a competitive advantage over the following treatments:
 

● | Chemotherapeutics: Side effects from chemotherapy can include pain, diarrhea, constipation, mouth sores, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, as well as blood-related side effects, which may include a low cell count of infection fighting white blood cells (neutropenia), low red blood cell count (anemia), and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Our goal is to demonstrate that our treatment will be more effective than chemotherapeutic and hormonal therapies with fewer side effects. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Targeted therapies: The most common type is multi-targeted kinase inhibitors (molecules which inhibit a specific class of enzymes called kinases). Common side effects include fatigue, rash, hand–foot reaction, diarrhea, hypertension and dyspnoea (shortness of breath). Furthermore, tyrosine kinases inhibited by these drugs appear to develop resistance to inhibitors. While the clinical findings with PRP are early and subject to confirmation in future clinical trials, no evidence has yet been observed of the development of resistance by the cancer to PRP. 
● | Monoclonal antibodies: Development of monoclonal antibodies is often difficult due to safety concerns. Side effects that are most common include skin and gastro-intestinal toxicities. For example, several serious side effects from Avastin, an anti-angiogenic cancer drug, include gastrointestinal perforation and dehiscence (e.g. rupture of the bowel), severe hypertension (often requiring emergency treatment) and nephrotic syndrome (protein leakage into the urine). Antibody therapy can be applied to various cancer types, but can also be limited to certain genetic sub populations in many instances. 
● | Immunotherapy: There is a long history of attempts to develop therapeutic cancer vaccines to stimulate the body’s own immune system to attack cancer cells. While these products generally do not have the poor safety profile of standard therapeutic approaches, only a relatively small number of them are FDA-approved and available as compared to the number of patients diagnosed with cancer. Furthermore, only a relatively small number of the patient population is eligible to receive and subsequently respond to treatment, as defined by preventing tumor growth.

License Agreements
 
We previously sponsored a collaborative research project at Bath University to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the potential clinical approach of our proprietary proenzyme formulation. As a result of this undertaking, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with University of Bath (UK), dated November 12, 2009 (the “Commercialization Agreement”), where, initially, we held an exclusive license with Bath University, and where we and Bath University co-owned the intellectual property relating to our proenzyme formulations. The Commercialization Agreement originally provided for Bath University to assign the Patents (as defined therein) to Propanc in certain specified circumstances, such as successful completion of a clinical trial and commencement of a Phase II (Proof of Concept) clinical trial.
 
On June 14, 2012, Propanc and Bath University agreed to an earlier assignment to us of the patents pursuant to an Assignment and Amendment Deed, on the proviso that Bath University retains certain rights arising from the Commercialization Agreement, as follows:

The basis of our intellectual property protection will be built around the following elements:
 

● | Method of use: Understanding the mechanism of action of the PRP proenzyme formulations, enabling the identification of new molecular targets, potential new therapeutic compounds and identification of new formulations that are adapted to enhance activity. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Formulation: We have developed an enhanced formulation containing the proenzyme trypsinogen in combination with at least one of two types of identified compounds considered effective for providing synergistic enhancement of the proenzyme based formulations. A patentability assessment, based on an international prior art search, has indicated that strong potential exists for successfully obtaining patent claims covering the formulation. 
● | Composition of Matter: Synthetic recombinant proteins designed to improve the quality, safety and performance of proenzymes used in the proposed formulations form part of the research and development program. 

Regulatory Matters
 
United States
 
Government oversight of the pharmaceutical industry is usually classified into pre-approval and post-approval categories. Most of the therapeutically significant innovative products marketed today are the subject of New Drug Applications (“NDA”). Preapproval activities, based on these detailed applications, are used to assure the product is safe and effective before marketing. In the United States, The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”), is the FDA organization responsible for over-the-counter and prescription drugs, including most biological therapeutics, and generic drugs.
 
Before approval, the FDA may inspect and audit the development facilities, planned production facilities, clinical trials, institutional review boards and laboratory facilities in which the product was tested in animals. After the product is approved and marketed, the FDA uses different mechanisms for assuring that firms adhere to the terms and conditions of approval described in the application and that the product is manufactured in a consistent and controlled manner. This is done by periodic unannounced inspections of production and quality control facilities by FDA’s field investigators and analysts.
 
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Public Health Service Act
 
Prescription drug and biologic products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA, including regulations that govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labelling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining FDA approval and achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. FDA approval is required before any new drug or biologic, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. All applications for FDA approval must contain, among other things, information relating to safety and efficacy, stability, manufacturing, processing, packaging, labelling and quality control.
New Drug Applications (“NDAs”)
 
The FDA’s NDA approval process generally involves:
 

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed product for each intended use; 


28
--


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s “current good manufacturing practice” (“CGMP”) regulations; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to and approval by the FDA of a NDA. 

 
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot guarantee that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of toxicity and immunogenicity in animals. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence clinical trials. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) covering each medical center proposing to conduct clinical trials must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive “good clinical practice” (“GCP”) regulations, which include requirements that all research subjects provide informed consent and that all clinical studies be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators.
 
For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:
 

● | Phase I: Initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety and dose tolerance; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase II: Generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine optimal dosage. A Phase IIa trial is a non-pivotal, exploratory study that assesses biological activity as its primary endpoint. A Phase IIb trial is designed as a definite dose finding study with efficacy as the primary endpoint. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase III clinical trials; 
● | Phase III: Commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase II evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. Generally, replicate evidence of safety and effectiveness needs to be demonstrated in two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials of a product candidate for a specific indication. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide adequate basis for product labelling; and 
● | Phase IV: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a NDA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety, purity and potency after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials. 

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. Concurrent with clinical studies, sponsors usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with CGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Moreover, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with the aforementioned manufacturing information, are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA. NDA’s must also contain extensive manufacturing information. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA agrees to specific goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review is applied to products that offer at most, only minor improvement over existing marketed therapies. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe, although a review can take significantly longer. A Priority Review designation is given to products that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A Priority Review takes the FDA six months to review a NDA. It is likely that our product candidates will be granted Standard Reviews. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
The FDA may deny approval of a NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or additional pivotal Phase III clinical trials. Even if such data is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials is not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than Propanc. Once issued, product approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”), and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labelling or manufacturing processes or facilities, approval of a new or supplemental NDA may be required, which may involve conducting additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 
After approval, products are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, which include company obligations to manufacture products in accordance with GMP, maintain and provide to the FDA updated safety and efficacy information, report adverse experiences with the product, keep certain records, submit periodic reports, obtain FDA approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes and comply with FDA promotion and advertising requirements and restrictions. Failure to meet these obligations can result in various adverse consequences, both voluntary and FDA-imposed, including product recalls, withdrawal of approval, restrictions on marketing and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown safety or efficacy issues may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA holder.
 
Propanc, and any manufacturers of our products, are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s GMP regulations. GMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet GMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before Propanc can use them to manufacture products. Propanc and any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
 
With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA imposes complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. A NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing a NDA.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, risk mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or to place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
In June 2017, we were notified by the FDA that PRP had been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Orphan drug designation may be granted by the FDA when a rare disease or condition is implicated and a potential treatment qualifies under the Orphan Drug Act and applicable FDA regulations. This qualifies us for various developmental incentives, including protocol assistance, the potential for research grants, the waiver of future application fees, and tax credits for clinical testing if we choose to host future clinical trials in the United States.
 
In October 2017, we submitted a request for a second orphan drug designation for PRP, this time for ovarian cancer.
 
On November 2, 2017, we were notified by the FDA that our request was not granted. The Office of Orphan Products Development (“OOPD”) stated that complete prevalence is used as a measure of disease in ovarian cancer, as this reflects the number of women who have been diagnosed with disease and may be eligible for treatment with the proposed therapy. Therefore, on the date of the submission of our application, the OOPD estimated that the prevalence of ovarian cancer was 228,110 cases. Since the prevalence exceeds the threshold of 200,000 to qualify for orphan drug designation, they could not grant our request. We may consider resubmitting our application if we can identify a suitable sub population in ovarian cancer, which may meet the target threshold.
 
European Union
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or market our product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may differ than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Despite these differences, the clinical trials will be conducted according to international standards such as Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), which is recognized by each foreign country under the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines. We will conduct our trials in each foreign jurisdiction according to these standards, undertaking a First-In-Human (FIH) Phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors, evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor efficacy of PRP. This will be followed by two Phase II studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of PRP. To ensure harmonization between the jurisdictions, we intend to conduct regulatory meetings in the country where trials are conducted, as well as the FDA and European Medicines Agency. A pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) meeting will be held with the FDA once initial patient data has been collected from the FIH study to ensure acceptability of future planned Phase II trials.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit and obtain authorization for a clinical trial application in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. After we have completed clinical trials, we must obtain marketing authorization before it can market its product. We must submit applications for marketing authorizations for oncology products under a centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) is the agency responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines that are to be assessed via the centralized procedure.

UK
 
On June 23, 2016, the UK government held a referendum to gauge voters’ support to remain or leave the European Union. The referendum resulted in 51.9% of UK voters in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” On March 29, 2017, the UK invoked Article 50 of Lisbon Treaty to initiate complete withdrawal from the European Union by March 30, 2019. Currently, the center for the EMA is based in London but the European Union intends to relocate the center to another city.
 
The impact of Brexit on the drug approval process in the UK is uncertain, which could significantly impact Propanc as we may elect to conduct our clinical trials for PRP in the UK. Companies based in the UK and operating in the drug industry are urging the European Union and the UK to reach an agreement to harmonize the regulatory process once the UK officially exits the European Union. We hope to commence our Phase IIa trials in 2021, and we are hopeful that there will be greater clarity on the regulatory process for drug approvals in UK in the near future.
 
Australia
 
In Australia, the relevant regulatory body responsible for the pharmaceutical industry is the Therapeutics Goods Administration (the “TGA”). Prescription medicines are regulated under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Under the Therapeutic Goods Act, the Therapeutic Goods Administration evaluates new products for quality, safety and efficacy before being approved for market authorization, according to similar standards employed by the FDA and EMA in the United States and European Union, respectively. However, receiving market authorization in one or two regions does not guarantee approval in another.
 
Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Although none of our product candidates have been commercialized for any indication, if they are approved for marketing, commercial success of our product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a drug must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country.
 
Eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies.
 
In many countries outside the United States, a drug must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any foreign market.

Marketing Approvals, Pricing and Reimbursement Regulations
 
The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States, recently passed legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted.
 
Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products.
 
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by continuing technological advancement and significant competition. While we believe that our technology platforms, product candidates, know-how, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products. The level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers will also significantly impact the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Employees
 
As of October 2, 2019, we have one full-time employee and two part-time employees. In addition to our employees, we engage key consultants and utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various services on our behalf. Some of our executive officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities that we do not believe conflict with our business. Over time, we may be required to hire additional employees or engage independent contractors to execute various projects that are necessary to grow and develop our business. These decisions will be made by our officers and directors, if and when appropriate.
