Customers
As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.
Our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers.
We manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors.
No single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018, or 2017.
Sales and Distribution
We maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region(1) as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----------------------------------+---+--------+---+------+---+------+---+--
​ | ​ | Fiscal | ​ | ​ 
​ | | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017 | | 
Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”) | | 36 | % | 38 | % | 36 | % | ​
Asia–Pacific | | 33 | | 34 | | 35 | ​ | ​
Americas | | 31 | | 28 | | 29 | ​ | ​
Total | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | % | ​


(1) | Net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We sell our products into approximately 150 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. In fiscal 2019, our direct sales represented approximately 80% of total net sales. We also sell our products indirectly via third-party distributors.
We maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. Our global coverage positions us near our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road, rail, sea, and air. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.
Seasonality and Backlog
We experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are typically the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.
Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.

Customer orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon business and market conditions. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-------------------------+---+-----------------+-------+------+---+-------+--
​ | ​ | Fiscal Year End | 
​ | | 2019 | | 2018 | 
​ | | (in millions) | ​ 
Transportation Solutions | ​ | $ | 1,639 | ​ | $ | 1,779 | ​
Industrial Solutions | ​ | | 1,315 | ​ | | 1,245 | ​
Communications Solutions | ​ | | 361 | ​ | | 441 | ​
Total | ​ | $ | 3,315 | ​ | $ | 3,465 | ​

We expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2019 will be filled during fiscal 2020.
Competition
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. Our markets have generally been growing but with downward pressure on prices.

Raw Materials
We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold and silver for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand.
Intellectual Property
Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.
We own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.
While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents.
Management Team and Employees
We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry.
Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company’s success. We continue to emphasize employee development and training, and we embrace diversity and inclusion.

We have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2019, we employed approximately 78,000 people worldwide, of whom 31,000 were in the EMEA region, 22,000 were in the Asia–Pacific region, and 25,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 49,000 were employed in manufacturing.
Government Regulation and Supervision
The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.
Environmental
Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union (“EU”) Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation, and similar laws.
Compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2019, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $15 million to $43 million, and we accrued $18 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.
