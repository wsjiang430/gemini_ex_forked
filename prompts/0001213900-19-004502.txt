Item 1. Business.
Business Combination
 
Phunware, Inc. (“Phunware”) was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware in February 2009. Phunware is a mobile application development platform and its primary internet address can be accessed at https://www.phunware.com.
 
On February 27, 2018, Phunware entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended (collectively, the “Merger Agreement”) with Stellar Acquisition III, Inc. (“Stellar”). On December 26, 2018, Stellar, a Republic of the Marshall Islands corporation incorporated in December 2015, deregistered as a corporation in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and domesticated as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware upon the filing with and acceptance by the Secretary of State of Delaware of the certificate of domestication in accordance with Section 388 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “Domestication”). Upon the effectiveness of the Domestication, Stellar became a Delaware corporation and, upon the consummation of the Business Combination (as defined below), Stellar changed its corporate name to “Phunware, Inc.” (the “Successor” or the “Company”) and all outstanding securities of Stellar were deemed to constitute outstanding securities of the Successor. Also on December 26, 2018, STLR Merger Subsidiary Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stellar (“Merger Sub”), merged with and into Phunware, Inc. (“Phunware”), a corporation incorporated in Delaware in February 2009, with Phunware surviving the merger (the “Merger”) and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Successor (the “Business Combination”). Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, Phunware changed its corporate name to “Phunware OpCo, Inc.” As of the open of trading on December 28, 2018, the common stock and warrants of the registrant began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market as “PHUN” and “PHUNW,” respectively.
 
In connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, holders of 1,813,487 shares of Stellar common stock sold in its initial public offering (“Public Shares”) exercised their right to redeem their Public Shares for cash at a price of $10.64 per share, for an aggregate amount of approximately $19.3 million. As a result of these redemptions, the Stellar trust account had approximately $0.4 million immediately prior to Closing.
 
In addition, 6,000 shares for aggregate cash proceeds of $6.0 million from the Series A 8% convertible preferred stock financing (“Series A Financing”) were issued in conjunction with the Business Combination. In connection with the Series A Financing, the Sponsors transferred an aggregate of 250,000 shares of Stellar common stock and 250,000 warrants to purchase shares of Stellar common stock to the Series A Financing investor, and 181,391 shares to certain service providers. The Sponsors are Astra Maritime Inc. and Dominium Investments Inc., affiliated with the Company’s Chairman of the board of directors and Magellan Investments Corp. and Firmus Investments Inc., affiliated with a member of our board of directors. 


Immediately after giving effect to the Business Combination (including the redemptions and the issuance of shares in the Series A Financing, both described above), there were approximately 27.3 million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase approximately 18.2 million shares of common stock of Phunware issued and outstanding.
 
In addition, with the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsors transferred to the former stockholders of Phunware 3,985,244 warrants to purchase shares of Successor common stock. As consideration for the warrants transferred to Phunware shareholders, a promissory note was issued to the Sponsors (the “Transfer Sponsor Warrant Note”). The amount of the note was approximately $1,993,000, which represented $0.50 per warrant transferred to former stockholders of Phunware. The warrants transferred have an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The Transfer Sponsor Warrant Note shall mature on December 26, 2019. The Transfer Sponsor Warrant Note was subsequently waived and forgiven by the noteholders.


Astra Maritime Inc. and Dominium Investments Inc., affiliates of the Company’s Chairman, Mr. Prokopios (Akis) Tsirigakis, and Magellan Investments Corp. and Firmus Investments Inc., affiliates of Mr. George Syllantavos, a Director of the Company (the “Sponsors”), also transferred to Stellar 627,864 shares of Stellar common stock, which shall be retained in treasury and available for issuance from time to time by Phunware.
 
Furthermore, Stellar issued 2,211,572 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsors as repayment in full for the unsecured promissory notes - related parties. The repayment of the related party notes was calculated at $0.50 per warrant.
 
Upon consummation of the Business Combination, the former stockholders of Phunware owned approximately 94.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Successor. This percentage excludes the impact of outstanding stock options and warrants.
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the parties thereto, certain of which are limited by materiality and material adverse effect. The parties have also each agreed to certain covenants contained in the Merger Agreement. The representations, warranties and covenants of the parties contained in the Merger Agreement terminated at the Closing, notwithstanding that any covenant that, by its terms, provides for performance following the consummation of the Business Combination shall survive until such covenant is performed.

There is no accounting effect or change in the carrying amount of the consolidated assets and liabilities of the Successor as a result of the domestication. The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Accordingly, Stellar is the legal acquirer and Phunware is the accounting acquirer and predecessor whereby the Successor’s historical financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Phunware, and the net cash proceeds obtained from Stellar in the Business Combination is reflected as a capital infusion. Furthermore, the historical capitalization of Phunware immediately before the Business Combination was adjusted based on the exchange ratio of 0.459 Successor shares for every one share of Phunware capital stock.
 
Business Overview
 
Phunware Inc. is the pioneer of Multiscreen-as-a-Service (“MaaS”) platform, a fully integrated enterprise cloud platform for mobile that provides companies the products, solutions, data and services necessary to engage, manage and monetize their mobile application portfolios and audiences at scale. According to comScore’s 2017 Mobile App Report, consumers spend 66% of their total digital time with mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), and 87% of their mobile time in mobile apps (vs. on mobile web). (Source: comScore 2017 Mobile App Report). Given this reality, brands must establish a strong identity on mobile, especially on devices and platforms specific to the Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems and ecosystems. We help brands define, create, launch, promote, monetize and scale their mobile identities as a means to anchor the digital transformation of their customers’ journeys and brand interactions. Our MaaS platform provides the entire mobile lifecycle of applications, media and data in one login through one procurement relationship.
 
 Our MaaS platform allows for the licensing and creation of category-defining mobile experiences for brands and their application users worldwide. We have successfully expanded our addressable market reach into various important and fast-growing markets: mobile cloud software, media, data science and cryptonetworking. Since our founding in 2009, our goal has been to use our software platform within the application portfolios of the world’s largest companies and brands to create a massive database of proprietary Phunware IDs. Phunware IDs are unique identifiers assigned to a mobile device when it becomes first visible across our network of mobile application portfolios. We measure and accumulate Phunware IDs every month through queries that count unique devices that access our mobile application portfolio across our network of mobile applications that we have developed and/or support. The data collected from our Phunware IDs contributes to our data subscription services and application transaction revenue product lines by helping companies and brands boost campaign performance, target high-value users, maximize conversions and optimize spend.
 
 We offer our platforms as Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”), Data-as-a-Service (“DaaS”) and application transactions media. Our business model includes recurring subscriptions, reoccurring transactions and services, often as one-year to five-year software or data licenses, or transaction-based media insertion orders. We prioritize our sales and marketing efforts first on recurring SaaS and DaaS subscriptions, second on reoccurring transactions and third on services. In years in which transactional engagements are not expected to be attractive for gross margins, they are either avoided or pursued opportunistically only. Our target customers are enterprise companies with large digital, mobile, marketing and information technology budgets and spending that are enacting digital transformation in their businesses.
 
Our Industry
 
We participate in four rapidly evolving markets — mobile cloud software, media, big data and cryptonetworking — each driven by some combination of technological advancements including cloud, software-defined infrastructure, mobility, data analytics, IoT and decentralization.
 
Mobile Cloud Software — The mobile cloud software market includes SaaS-based mobile software for all businesses, brands and consumers. The mobile application market is enormous, with worldwide smartphone users downloading more than 175 billion apps — and spending over $86 billion on them — in 2017. (Source: App Annie, 2017 Retrospective). The number of apps available to Android and iOS users climbed over 6 million in 2017 as well, and the average number of apps on a user’s phone is approximately 80. (Source: App Annie, 2017 Retrospective). In 2018, the app economy was predicted to enter a new era and surpass $110 billion in app store spend (Source: App Annie, Top Predictions for the App Economy in 2018).
 
Media Market — The digital media market includes display, native, video and other types of paid media campaigns rendered on a connected device and used for audience building, audience engagement or audience monetization. According to eMarketer, digital media spending including mobile will top $225 billion and represent 49.6% of total media investment by 2021 (Source: eMarketer, “Worldwide Ad Spending eMarketer’s Updated Estimates and forecast for 2016-2021”). According to the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), users spend 66% of their online time on a mobile device and mobile advertising revenue now makes up 54% of all digital ad revenues (Source: Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), “Digital Trends: Consumer Usage of Digital and its Influence on Ad Revenue”). In the first half of 2017, mobile advertising revenue was $21.7 billion in the US alone (Source: Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), “Digital Trends: Consumer Usage of Digital and its Influence on Ad Revenue”) and Goodway Group predicts it will grow nearly 4% month-over-month with an expected overall price increase of over 45% by 2019. (Source: Goodway Group, “2018 Programmatic Pricing Guide Projects Big Price Increase for mobile Ads by 2019”).

Big Data Market — The big data market includes businesses engaged in the creation, consumption and/or processing of big data. IDC forecasts that this market will grow from $130 billion in 2016 to more than $203 billion in 2020 (Source: IDC, “Double-Digit Growth Forecast for the Worldwide Big Data and Business Analytics Market Through 2020 Led by Banking and Manufacturing Investments, According to IDC,” October 3, 2015). According to Cisco Systems, global mobile data traffic will grow from 7 exabytes per month in 2016 to 49 exabytes per month in 2021, a compound annual growth rate of 47 percent (Source: Source: Cisco Global Cloud Index: Forecast and Methodology, 2016-201 White Paper). Users are increasingly willing to share their data and participate in this market: 40% of broadband households are willing to share data with manufacturers for product monitoring and maintenance (Source: Parks and Associates, “More than three-fourths of U.S. broadband households use Wi-Fi for in-home connectivity,” May 31, 2017). Across 17 countries studied, 27% users are willing to share their personal data in exchange for benefits or rewards like lower costs or personalized service (Source: GFK Insights, “More people firmly agree with sharing personal data, in return for rewards, than firmly disagree,” January 27, 2017).
 
Cryptonetworking — The cryptonetworking market includes currencies and other tokens that use distributed ledger technology and cryptography to secure transactions and verify asset transfers. We believe that it grew exponentially over the course of 2017 and 2018 and will continue to grow, and that cryptocurrencies are larger than many national currencies and other major payment networks.
 
Real-time cryptocurrency market capitalization information is available at the CoinMarketCap website.
 
PhunCoin™ (“PhunCoin”)
 
We previously formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, PhunCoin, Inc. that will be the issuer of our PhunCoin. PhunCoin will be designed for use within the PhunCoin Ecosystem, which is intended to be a rewards marketplace and data exchange whereby users receive PhunCoin in exchange for their information and PhunCoin can be redeemed by users for goods and services. The PhunCoin Ecosystem is currently in the development stage and is intended to enhance and augment our current mobile application platform, which enables businesses to engage, manage and monetize the information collected by end users and our customers from our consumers.
 
We currently anticipate that our products and technologies will be enhanced through the creation of the PhunCoin Ecosystem, and that users in the new PhunCoin Ecosystem will fall into three basic categories:
 

● | Manufacturers, consumer product companies, marketing firms, brands and other sellers of goods and services. We generally refer to this group as our “customers.” 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Individuals that provide personally identifiable information to us and our customers. We generally refer to this group as “consumers.” 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Application developers that will include the PhunCoin software development kits into their applications and other software developers and engineers that will help create and maintain the PhunCoin Ecosystem. We generally refer to this group as “developers.” 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We anticipate that, when the PhunCoin Ecosystem becomes operational, our customers will generally continue to pay us cash for use of our technology and our consumers and developers generally will receive PhunCoin in exchange for providing services and information to us and our customers.
 
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, PhunCoin Sub commenced an offering to raise capital to fund the development and creation of the PhunCoin Ecosystem through the issuance of rights to receive future PhunCoin (the “Rights”). These Rights will only be issued to accredited investors pursuant to an offering under Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act that complies with know-your-customer (“KYC”), anti-money-laundering (“AML”) and accredited investor verification requirements.
 
Our current expectation is that the proceeds from the Rule 506(c) offering of Rights is anticipated to be used solely to fund development of the PhunCoin Ecosystem, with any additional amounts being used at the discretion of the Phunware or PhunCoin Sub. We currently estimate that the use of proceeds from the Rule 506(c) offering of Rights are anticipated to be used as follows:
 

● | 35% — Sales & Marketing 
--+----------------------------


● | 35% — Research & Development 
--+---------------------------------


● | 20% — Ecosystem Development 
--+--------------------------------


● | 10% — General & Administrative 
--+-----------------------------------

PhunCoin will be a digital asset built and transacted on top of an existing blockchain technology. We do not intend to create our own blockchain technology. As a part of our research and development, we evaluated several blockchain technologies to determine which of these providers meet the design specifications we require to create the PhunCoin Ecosystem. We are have evaluated the feasibility of potential solutions and have conducted technical evaluations, performance evaluations, user testing, and other analyses in order to determine the best technology for the PhunCoin Ecosystem. As a result, we have decided to initially use the Stellar blockchain technology for the PhunCoin Ecosystem, although we may choose to use a different blockchain technology in the future. We believe that the Stellar blockchain technology will also enable us to comply with the registration and other requirements of the federal and state securities laws and other applicable laws and regulations.
 
As part of the PhunCoin Ecosystem launch (i.e., the “Token Generation Event”), PhunCoin Sub intends to issue PhunCoin pursuant to an offering either registered or eligible for exemption from registration under the Securities Act. However, there is no assurance that the PhunCoin Ecosystem will be operational by then (if at all) nor that the offering of PhunCoin will be registered or eligible for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. PhunCoin will initially be issued to holders of the Rights and also to holders of warrantholders of the PhunCoin Right who were also issued warrants that entitle them to receive PhunCoin if the Token Generation Event occurs. These PhunCoin will have the same terms, other than price, as the PhunCoin being issued to holders of the Rights.
 
For securities law purposes, PhunCoin is deemed to have already been sold to the holders of the Rights and the warrantholders that have a Right to future issuance of PhunCoin (“PhunCoin Right”). This means that, if and when issued, such PhunCoin will be restricted as to transfer and that any resale by such holders must be made pursuant to an exemption from registration or pursuant to an effective resale registration statement. Phunware does not believe that the PhunCoin issued to holders of the Rights and PhunCoin Right will have any material impact on the amount of capital PhunCoin Sub (or Phunware) may be able to raise for the purposes of creating and operating the PhunCoin Ecosystem or other future capital needs. This is because PhunCoin Sub (i) does not currently contemplate using the proposed PhunCoin offering, as described below, to raise capital (although it could determine to do that as well) but rather, to allow PhunCoin to be distributed in exchange for data and services and (ii) Phunware and the PhunCoin Sub expect to be able to access other sources of capital, which may include debt financings and equity financings through additional private placements, or other offerings (including the current Rule 506(c) private placement which is offering up to $100 million of Rights).
 
Phunware intends for PhunCoin Sub to be the actual issuer of PhunCoin. Before PhunCoin Sub issues PhunCoin to the holders of PhunCoin Right, Phunware will obtain the consent of those warrantholders representing the requisite vote necessary to amend the warrant to provide for the assignment by Phunware to PhunCoin Sub of all of Phunware’s obligations to issue PhunCoin. Pursuant to the amendment, PhunCoin Sub will fully and unconditionally assume all of Phunware’s obligations to issue PhunCoin that exist under the warrant. Phunware will notify all warrantholders of any amendment to the warrant and the assignment by Phunware, and the assumption by PhunCoin, of the obligations to issue PhunCoin and intends to file a Current Report on Form 8-K once the amendment is entered into and becomes effective.
 
Once our proposed PhunCoin offering is either registered with the SEC or eligible for an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, we expect to distribute PhunCoin to developers in exchange for services, i.e. for the inclusion of the PhunCoin software development kit (i.e. SDK) into the developers’ applications and for the application usage data they provide to the PhunCoin Ecosystem. We also intend to distribute PhunCoin to consumers in exchange for their agreements to provide certain benefits to us, including, but not be limited to, enriching their data with additional information and participating in marketing campaigns that will assist us to deliver increased value to customers.
 
At this time, we have not taken any action to list PhunCoin on a trading platform. We intend to list and allow trading of PhunCoin in the future, but only on those platforms that comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws. Currently, no such trading platforms exist.
 
PhunCoin is intended to be a digital asset that entitles the holder to access the PhunCoin Ecosystem that we are building and to use PhunCoin in exchange for goods and services in the PhunCoin Ecosystem. Both PhunCoin and the PhunCoin Ecosystem are currently under development and, therefore, the specific legal and economic rights have not been finalized. However, we do not expect that PhunCoin will have any governance, voting, dividend or other rights with respect to either PhunCoin Sub or us, and that we expect that all holders of PhunCoin will have the same rights.
 
Our core business is as a mobile application platform enabling our customers to utilize the platform to engage, manage and monetize their interaction with consumers. Today, this takes the form of software modules such as location-based services, analytics, content management, marketing automation, and other customer engagement technology designed to create desired business outcomes for that customer. We expect to integrate PhunCoin into our core business platform as well as create new software and systems to support the PhunCoin Ecosystem. PhunCoin will complement and supplement our core business by adding new capabilities for our customers to use “cryptonetworking” to engage consumers, while at the same time creating a new ecosystem that allows those consumers to benefit from the provision and use of their data. Our core business enables the rapid integration of mobile solutions, but PhunCoin further enhances that capability by incentivizing customer and consumer engagement with these solutions.
 
Cryptonetworking is currently not available to Phunware customers. To make cryptonetworking available, Phunware intends to deploy a combination of standalone technology as well as integration into its MaaS platform such that customers could potentially use cryptonetworking as a reward for consumers taking action in an application built on the MaaS platform. Phunware is not currently generating, nor in the past has it generated, revenue from this product or solution offering. To the extent that this type of functionality may require the PhunCoin Ecosystem to become a registered broker-dealer and register as an alternative trading system with the SEC, PhunCoin Sub intends to undertake those registrations or revise the functionality in order to remain fully compliant with all applicable laws.

Each PhunCoin user account will be created using a technology called self-sovereign identity. This is an identity that is based on blockchain technology and gives the user full control over this identity without a central authority. Since our approach to this identity starts with an application and the user’s mobile device, the User who creates this identity will then be paired to the device through a relationship on that identity system. In addition, this identity will be paired with an account on the blockchain provider, which will then be the blockchain account at which the PhunCoin can be received via transactions. Key recovery functions and custody of private digital asset keys will be handled by the identity solution provider and integrated into the software system.
 
We do not intend to create our own self-sovereign identity system, but to evaluate other existing systems already proven in the market and to integrate them into the PhunCoin Ecosystem. Such providers include, but are not limited to, Sovrin/Everynm, Veres.One and uPort. As a part of research and development, we will evaluate an array of self-sovereign technology providers to determine which of these providers meet the design specifications we require to create the PhunCoin Ecosystem. For each provider, we will conduct technical evaluations, performance evaluations, user testing, etc. to determine the best technology for the PhunCoin Ecosystem. This will include evaluation and implementation of the technical architecture needed to validate ownership and approve transfer of PhunCoin in order to comply with applicable securities laws.
 
Where possible, we intend to use existing mobile security features, such as, but not limited to, Apple Touch ID to further secure and at the same time enable easy access to the PhunCoin application using biometric/fingerprint capabilities of those devices.
 
A multidisciplinary team (design engineering, quality assurance, and product) is actively developing all aspects of the PhunCoin Ecosystem. iOS and Android PhunCoin wallet and SDK development is also underway and the data exchange capabilities are being implemented, including segment management and data monetization.

Competitive Strengths
 
Fully integrated and comprehensive solutions: Our comprehensive solutions can be used across mobile application experience definition, application portfolio creation, user discovery, user acquisition, user engagement and user monetization. Data from application analytics and our database of over one petabyte can be used to inform business decisions related to mobile strategy, marketing, operations and more.
 
Data reach and scale: Since Phunware’s founding in 2009, our goal has been to use our software platform within the application portfolios of the world’s largest companies and brands to create a massive database of proprietary Phunware IDs for every device touching networks globally to then reach everyone, everywhere, indoors and outdoors, in real time, on a 1-to-1 basis.
 
Built to be mobile-first, native-first, cloud-based: Phunware was built from the ground up to focus on native mobile development, while other companies in the mobile space have attempted to create shortcuts with “write once, run anywhere” software. The result is almost a decade of platform-specific mobile expertise, a major competitive differentiator.

Results-driven culture: Our employees are granted stock options upon hire and are encouraged to think of Phunware as a company they own rather than a company for which they work. We also promote from within to reward top performers and encourage leadership development. The result is an employee base singularly focused on solving problems and driving results.
 
Intellectual property portfolio development and world-class engineering resources: Through our world-class in-house technical and engineering organization, we have focused developing our intellectual property, including methods of accessing wireless account information, rendering content on a wireless device, indoor navigation with a mobile device and more. We are developing creative solutions to solve complex technical problems and create competitive advantages for our customers.
 
Consumer-first mindset: As news stories about improper use and abuse of consumer data by social networks and app developers continue to surface, we are in a unique position to capitalize on other technology companies’ lack of foresight. The PhunCoin crypto token will empower users to control and be compensated for the data they contribute to the PhunCoin Ecosystem, and it will prevent traditional security breach concerns by storing and biometrically protecting data and self-sovereign identity client-side (versus in the cloud).
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
 
Expand mobile products and services. Mobile applications, media and data are among the fastest-growing and complex technology markets. We have made significant investments in research and development and plan to continue extending the functionality and breadth of our applications in the future.
 
Deepen existing customer relationships. We believe that we are well positioned to identify new opportunities or enhance existing services and solutions within our existing customers. We create cross and upsell opportunity between subscription, media and data customers as each customer seeks to deepen its approach to mobile application lifecycle management.
 
Develop new relationships to expand our customer base. We intend to continue to grow our customer base by expanding our team of sales professionals and developing our indirect channel relationships. We are able to leverage our mobile expertise and capabilities to compete effectively for new customers both directly and indirectly. Primary indirect channels include hardware, software, carriers and systems integrators/consultancies.
 
Continue to grow our strong domestic footprint and expand internationally. We have a strong and growing presence in the United States and we believe there are significant opportunities for further domestic expansion. We believe there are multiple attractive market opportunities, both domestically and internationally, into which we will continue to opportunistically expand. Top expansion targets include entertainment, healthcare, retail and real estate — all verticals that benefit from our integrated solutions, comprehensive lifecycle approach and ability to engage users in both digital and physical worlds.
 
Add new capabilities and geographic regions through strategic acquisition. We operate in a fragmented market that offers significant consolidation opportunities. We will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance our capabilities and expand our geographic footprint, both domestically and internationally.
 
Expand our partnership network with third-party providers of tools and services. We are able to leverage our mobile expertise and capabilities to compete effectively for new customers both directly and indirectly. Primary indirect channels include hardware, software, carriers and systems integrators/consultancies. We are focused on building our brand to grow within existing and target end markets where there is strong demand for the products and solutions we provide.
 
Our Customers
 
Our target customers are enterprise companies with consistent IT spending that are looking to enact digital transformation in their business — whether it is retail, healthcare, entertainment, real estate or any other industry. We provide technology and solutions to support these companies through every stage of the mobile application lifecycle.
 
We believe the multi-year contractual nature of our software and managed services provides revenue visibility. Our subscription agreements with our customers consist of standard services agreements that generally do not contain any minimum commitment terms that would guarantee business for us and do not impose obligations upon us such as exclusivity or other terms. These agreements provide standard terms relating to payment, liability, performance, cancellation and termination, confidentiality, and indemnification obligations, among other provisions. All of these agreements contain terms of service that generally are consistent across Phunware’s customers. These standard services agreements are, for the most part, governed by the standard terms and conditions from the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (“IAB”) Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less, which provides that in the event that payments are not paid to the agency, then the media company, or us, agrees to hold the advertiser solely liable.

Concentration of Major Customers
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our sales were concentrated with Fox Networks Group (“Fox”) and Fetch Media, Ltd. (“Fetch”), which accounted for 42% and 21% of our net sales, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our sales were concentrated with Fox and Fetch, which accounted for 44% and 11% of our net sales, respectively. As with our other subscriptions and services customers, our contractual arrangements with Fox are governed by standard terms of service and statements of work. Furthermore, our contractual arrangements with our application transaction customers, including Fetch, are governed by insertion orders, which in addition to being governed by our standard terms and conditions are also governed by IAB terms, including but not limited to payment liability and obligations. The revenue concentration of these customers is simply a function of the Company selling additional services and expanding the scope of work. Terms are consistent with our standard terms and contain no materially different terms or conditions.
 
Our agreements, including those with Fox and Fetch, are pursuant to standard services agreements. All of these agreements contain standard terms of service that generally are consistent across Phunware’s customers.
 
Our application transaction agreements, also known as insertion orders, are typically governed by the IAB Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Adverting for Media Buys One Year or Less (V3.0) (the “IAB Terms”), which can be found on the IAB’s website. The IAB Terms in Section III.c provide that in the event that payments are not paid to the agency, then the media company, or us, agrees to hold the advertiser solely liable. Phunware views the agreements as contracts that ordinarily accompany the business conducted by Phunware and, because of the lack of any commitments to provide a certain amount of business, Phunware is not substantially dependent on the agreements.
 
Competition
 
The market for technology and solutions related to mobile application lifecycle management is evolving, highly competitive and significantly fragmented. With the introduction of new technologies and the potential entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase renewals and maintain our prices.
 
We compete primarily with companies offering cloud-based software solutions for location-based services, mobile marketing automation, content management, analytics and audience monetization, as well as data and campaign management for audience building and engagement. We also sometimes compete with application development agencies, in-house mobile teams and products developed by software providers that allow customers to build and scale new mobile applications. Our competitors include Adobe, Oracle, Urban Airship, Chaotic Moon, Adroll and many more.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

● | product features and functionality; 
--+----------------------------------------


● | location accuracy and latency; 
--+-----------------------------------


● | technology architecture; 
--+-----------------------------


● | level of customer satisfaction;

● | domain expertise;

● | size of customer base and level of user adoption; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some of our current competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater resources to devote to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships, and/or longer operating histories and greater name recognition. As a result, these competitors may be better able to respond quickly to new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. In a few cases, some competitors may also be able to offer competing solutions at little or no additional cost by bundling them with their existing suite of solutions.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to companies engaged in the business of advertising on mobile devices. In addition, many areas of law that apply to our business are still evolving and could potentially affect our business to the extent they restrict our business practices or impose a greater risk of liability.
 
Given the nascent stage of mobile advertising, industry practices are rapidly evolving. We participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance and other industry groups that are developing best practices for the mobile advertising industry.
 
Privacy and Data Protection
 
Privacy and data protection laws play a significant role in our business. In the United States, at both the state and federal level, there are laws that govern activities such as the collection and use of data by companies like us and privacy and data protection issues generally have gained wide media and public attention recently. Online advertising activities in the United States have primarily been subject to regulation by the FTC, which has regularly relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to enforce against unfair and deceptive trade practices. Section 5 has been the primary regulatory tool used to enforce against alleged violations of online privacy policies and would apply to privacy practices in the mobile advertising industry. In December 2012, the FTC adopted amendments to rules under COPPA, which went into effect in July 2013. These amendments broadened the potential applicability of COPPA compliance obligations to our activities and those of our clients. Further, Europe’s new General Data Protection Regulation (which came into force in May 2018) extends the jurisdictional scope of European data protection law. As a result, we will be subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) when we provide our media and data services in Europe. The GDPR imposes stricter data protection requirements that may necessitate changes to our services and business practices.
 
The issue of privacy in the mobile advertising industry is still evolving. Federal legislation and rulemaking has been proposed from time to time that would govern certain advertising practices as they relate to mobile devices, including the use of precise geolocation data. Although such legislation has not been enacted, it remains a possibility that such federal and state laws may be passed in the future.
 
There have been numerous civil lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, filed against companies that conduct business in the mobile device industry, including makers of mobile devices, mobile application providers, mobile operating system providers and mobile third-party networks. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits have alleged a range of violations of federal, state and common laws, including computer trespass and violation of privacy laws.
 
In addition, mobile services are generally not restricted by geographic boundaries and our services reach mobile devices throughout the world. We transact business with our customers in Europe and Southeast Asia and, as a result, some of our activities may also be subject to the laws of foreign jurisdictions. In particular, European data protection laws can be more restrictive regarding the collection and use of data than those in U.S. jurisdictions. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.
 
Research and Development
 
Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality into our solutions. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving and enhancing our existing service offerings by working closely with our customers, conducting quality assurance testing and improving our core technology as well as developing new proprietary services and solutions. Performance, security, functional depth and breadth, and usability of our solutions drive our technology decisions and product development.

Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to protect our intellectual property, including our technologies, is an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We protect our intellectual property through trade secrets law, patents, copyrights, trademarks and contracts. We have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information such as the use of our license agreements with customers and our use of our confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, business partners and advisors where appropriate. Some of our technologies rely upon third party licensed intellectual property.
 
In the United States, we have 13 patents issued and 6 non-provisional patent applications. The issued patents expire between the years 2027 and 2036. In addition, we have registered “Phunware” as a trademark in the United States and Canada. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Furthermore, even if a patent is issued, we cannot assure you that such patent will be adequate to protect our business. We also license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
 
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in our markets have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in litigation. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may assert patent, copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our customers. Our standard license and other agreements may obligate us to indemnify our channel partners and customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from continuing to offer our solution or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights, royalties or other fees. Competitors may also be more likely to claim that our solutions infringe their proprietary rights and seek an injunction against us from continuing to offer our platform. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights.
 
Employees
 
We leverage our employees’ long-standing, deep customer relationships and strong technical expertise to deliver complex solutions that meet customer needs and advance mobile technology. As of December 31, 2018, we had 148 employees, including 104 software developers, engineers, QA engineers and product managers. We employed a sales and marketing force of approximately 20 professionals.
 
We believe it is as the result of its employee base that we have long-standing customer engagements and strong financial performance. None of our employees are currently covered under any collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
