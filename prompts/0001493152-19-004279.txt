Overview
 
Digital Ally produces digital video imaging and storage products for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. Our current products are an in-car digital video/audio recorder contained in a rear-view mirror for use in law enforcement and commercial fleets; a system that provides our law enforcement customers with audio/video surveillance from multiple vantage points and hands-free automatic activation of body-worn cameras and in-car video systems; a miniature digital video recording system designed to be worn on an individual’s body; and cloud storage solutions, including cloud-based fleet management and driver monitoring/training applications. We have active research and development programs to adapt our technologies to other applications. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create unique solutions to address needs in a variety of other industries and markets, including mass transit, school bus, taxi cab and the military. We sell our products to law enforcement agencies and other security organizations, and consumer and commercial fleet operators through direct sales domestically and third-party distributors internationally. We have several new and derivative products in research and development that we anticipate will begin commercial production during 2019.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. From that date until November 30, 2004, when we entered into a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., a Nevada corporation which was formerly known as Trophy Tech Corporation (the “Acquired Company”), we had not conducted any operations and were a closely-held company. In conjunction with the merger, we were renamed Digital Ally, Inc.
 
The Acquired Company, which was incorporated on May 16, 2003, engaged in the design, development, marketing and sale of bow hunting-related products. Its principal product was a digital video recording system for use in the bow hunting industry. It changed its business plan in 2004 to adapt its digital video recording system for use in the law enforcement and security markets. We began shipments of our in-car digital video rear view mirror in March 2006.

On January 2, 2008, we commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “DGLY.” We conduct our business from 9705 Loiret Boulevard, Lenexa, Kansas 66219. Our telephone number is (913) 814-7774.
 
Products
 
We produce and sell digital audio/video recording, storage and other products in law enforcement and commercial applications. These product series have been used primarily in law enforcement and private security applications, both of which use the core competency of our technology in digital video compression, recording and storage. In 2011, we introduced several derivative products as “event recorders” that can be used in taxi cab, limousine, ambulance and other commercial fleet vehicle applications which served to greatly diversify our addressable market. Our commercial products have also been utilized by off-airport parking service providers, cruise lines, education and NASCAR races among a diverse group of other commercial applications. We also intend to produce and sell other digital video products in the future that will continue to expand our reach beyond the traditional law enforcement, private security and commercial fleet applications. We have developed and continue to develop both local server and cloud based storage, archiving and search capabilities that provide customers with innovative, useful and secure methods to store and maintain their audio/video data. These products incorporate our standards-based digital compression capability that allows the recording of significant time periods on a chip and circuit board which can be designed into small forms and stored. The following describes our product portfolio.
 
In-Car Digital Video Mirror System for law enforcement –DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite
 
In-car video systems for patrol cars are now a necessity and have generally become standard. Current systems are primarily digital based systems with cameras mounted on the windshield and the recording device generally in the trunk, headliner, dashboard, console or under the seat of the vehicle. Most manufacturers have already developed and transitioned completely to digital video, and some have offered full HD level recordings which is currently state-of-art for the industry.
 
Our digital video rear view mirror unit is a self-contained video recorder, microphone and digital storage system that is integrated into a rear-view mirror, with a monitor, GPS and 900 MHz audio transceiver. Our system is more compact and unobtrusive than certain of our competitors because it requires no recording equipment to be located in other parts of the vehicle.
 
Our in-car digital video rear view mirror has the following features:
 

● | wide angle zoom color camera; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | standards-based video and audio compression and recording; 
● | system is concealed in the rear view mirror, replacing factory rear view mirror; 
● | monitor in rear-view mirror is invisible when not activated; 
● | eliminates need for analog tapes to store and catalogue; 
● | easily installs in any vehicle; 
● | ability to integrate with body-worn cameras including auto-activation of either system; 
● | archives audio/video data to the cloud, computers (wirelessly) and to compact flash memory, or file servers; 
● | 900 MHz audio transceiver with automatic activation; 
● | marks exact location of incident with integrated GPS; 
● | playback using Windows Media Player; 
● | optional wireless download of stored video evidence; 
● | proprietary software protects the chain of custody; 
● | and records to rugged and durable solid state memory.

The Company has announced that it is developing a new in-car Digital Video platform under the name EVO-HD which it plans to launch during 2019. The EVO-HD is a next generation system that offers a multiple HD in-car camera solution system with built-in patented VuLink auto-activation technology. The EVO-HD is built on an entirely new and highly advanced technology platform that enables many new and revolutionary features, including auto activation beyond the car and body camera. No other provider can offer built-in patented VuLink auto-activation technology. The EVO-HD will provide law enforcement officers with an easier to use, faster and more advanced system for capturing video evidence and uploading. Additional features include:
 

● | A remote cloud trigger feature that allows dispatchers to remotely start recordings; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Simultaneous audio/video play back; 
● | Cloud Connectivity via cell modem; 
● | Near real-time mapping and system health monitoring; 
● | Body-camera connectivity with built-in auto activation technology; and 
● | 128GB internal storage, up to 2TB external SDD storage. 

 
The EVO-HD is designed and built on a new and highly advanced technology platform that will become the platform for a whole new family of in-car video solution products for the law enforcement. The innovative EVO-HD technology will replace the current in-car mirror-based systems with a miniaturized system that can be custom-mounted in the vehicle while offering numerous hardware configurations to meet the varied needs and requirements of its law enforcement customers. The EVO-HD can support up to four HD cameras, with two cameras having pre-event and evidence capture assurance (ECA) capabilities to allow agencies to review entire shifts. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the VuVault cloud, powered by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), and real time metadata when in the field.
 
In-Car Digital Video “Event Recorder” System –DVM-250 Plus for Commercial Fleets
 
Digital Ally provides commercial fleets and commercial fleet managers with the digital video tools they need to increase driver safety, track assets in real-time and minimize the company’s liability risk all while enabling fleet managers to operate the fleet at an optimal level. We market a product designed to address these commercial fleet markets with our DVM-250 Plus event recorders that provide all types of commercial fleets with features and capabilities which are fully-customizable, consistent with their specific application and inherent risks. The DVM-250 Plus is a rear-view mirror based digital audio and video recording system with many, but not all of, the features of our DVM-800 law enforcement mirror systems at a lower price point. The DVM-250 Plus is designed to capture “events,” such as wrecks and erratic driving or other abnormal occurrences, for evidentiary or training purposes. These markets may find our units attractive from both a feature and cost perspective compared to other providers. Our marketing efforts indicate that commercial fleets are adopting this technology, in particular the ambulance and taxi-cab markets.
 
Digital Ally offers a suite of data management web-based tools to assist fleet managers in the organization, archival, and management of videos and telematics information. Within the suite, there are powerful mapping and reporting tools that help optimize efficiency, serve as excellent training tools for teams on safety and ultimately generate a significant return on investment for the organization.
 
The EVO-HD described above will also become the platform for a whole new family of in-car video solution products for the commercial markets. The innovative EVO-HD technology will replace the current in-car mirror-based systems with a miniaturized system that can be custom-mounted in the vehicle while offering numerous hardware configurations to meet the varied needs and requirements of its commercial customers. In its commercial market application, the EVO-HD can support up to four HD cameras, with two cameras having pre-event and evidence capture assurance (ECA) capabilities to allow customers to review entire shifts. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the FleetVU Manager cloud-based system for commercial fleet tracking and monitoring, powered by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), and real time metadata when in the field.

Miniature Body-Worn Digital Video System – FirstVU HD for law enforcement and private security
 
This system is also a derivative of our in-car video systems, but is much smaller and lighter and more rugged and water-resistant to handle a hostile outdoor environment. These systems can be used in many applications in addition to law enforcement and private security and are designed specifically to be clipped to an individual’s pocket or other outer clothing. The unit is self-contained and requires no external battery or storage devices. Current systems offered by competitors are digital based, but generally require a battery pack and/or storage device to be connected to the camera by wire or other means. We believe that our FirstVU HD product is more desirable for potential users than our competitors’ offerings because of its video quality, small size, shape and lightweight characteristics. Our FirstVU HD integrates with our in-car video systems through our patented VuLink system allowing for automatic activation of both systems.
 
Auto-activation and Interconnectivity between in-car video systems and FirstVU HD body worn camera products – VuLink for law enforcement applications
 
Recognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem that provides intuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically activating an officer’s cameras when the light bar is activated or a data-recording device such as a smart weapon is activated. Additionally, the awarded patent claims cover automatic coordination between multiple recording devices. Prior to this work, officers were forced to manually activate each device while responding to emergency scenarios, a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and diverted officers’ attention during critical moments. Our FirstVU HD integrates with our in-car video systems through our patented VuLink system allowing for automatic activation of both systems.
 
This feature is becoming a standard feature required by many law agencies. Unfortunately, certain competitors have chosen to infringe our patent and develop products that provide the same or similar features as our VuLink system. We have filed lawsuits against two competitors Axon Enterprises, Inc. (“Axon,” formerly known as Taser International, Inc.) and Enforcement Video, LLC dba WatchGuard Video (“WatchGuard”) that challenge their infringing products. We believe that the outcome of these lawsuits will largely define the competitive landscape for the body-worn and in-car video market for the foreseeable future. We expect that our VuLink product and its related patents will be recognized as the revolutionary and pioneering invention by the courts.
 
VuVault.net and FleetVU Manager
 
VuVault.net is a cost-effective, fully expandable, law enforcement cloud storage solution powered by Amazon Web Services that provides CJIS compliant redundant and security-enhanced storage of all uploaded videos.
 
FleetVU Manager is our web-based software for commercial fleet tracking and monitoring that features and manages video captured by our Video Event Data Recorders of incidents requiring attention, such as accidents. This software solution features our cloud-based web portal that utilizes many of the features of our VUVault.NET law-enforcement cloud-based storage solution.
 
Other Products
 
During the last year, we focused our research and development efforts to meet the varying needs of our customers, enhance our existing products and commence development of new products and product categories. Our research and development efforts are intended to maintain and enhance our competitiveness in the market niche we have carved out, as well as positioning us to compete in diverse markets outside of law enforcement.
Market and Industry Overview
 
Historically, our primary market has been domestic and international law enforcement agencies. In 2012, we expanded our scope by pursuing the commercial fleet vehicle and mass transit markets. In the future, given sufficient capital and market opportunity, we may further expand or focus on private security, homeland security, mass transit, healthcare, general retail, educational, general consumer and other commercial markets. In that regard, we have several installations involving private security on cruise ships and similar markets. Our view is there are many potential private uses of our product offerings. We have made inroads into certain commercial fleet and the ambulance service provider market, confirming that our DVM-250 Plus product and FleetVU Manager can become a significant revenue producer for us.
Law Enforcement
 
We believe that law enforcement already recognizes a valuable use of our various digital audio/video products for the recording of roadside sobriety tests. Without some form of video or audio recording, court proceedings usually consist of the police officer’s word against that of the suspect. Records show that conviction rates increase substantially where there is video evidence to back up officer testimony. Video evidence also helps to protect police departments against frivolous lawsuits.

The largest source of police video evidence today is in-car video. Unfortunately, some police cars still do not have in-car video, and in those that do, the camera usually points forward rather than to the side of the road where the sobriety test takes place. The in-car video is typically of little use for domestic violence investigations, burglary or theft investigations, disorderly conduct calls or physical assaults. In all of these cases, the FirstVU HD may provide recorded evidence of the suspect’s actions and reactions to police intervention.
 
Additionally, motorcycle patrolmen rarely have video systems. Our FirstVU body camera is well suited as a mobile application of our digital video recording system that can be used by motorcycle police and water patrol.
 
Crime scene investigations, including detailed photography, are typically a large part of the budgets of metropolitan police forces. The FirstVU may record a significant portion of such evidence at a much lower cost for gathering, analyzing and storing data and evidence.
 
Commercial and Other Markets
 
There are numerous potential applications for our digital audio/video camera products. We believe that other potential markets for our digital video systems, including the derivatives currently being developed, include private investigators, SWAT team members, over-the-road trucking fleets, airport security, municipal fire departments, and the U.S. military. Other potential commercial markets for our digital video systems include sporting venues and arenas.
Schools
 
We believe our products and offerings may be of benefit in kindergarten through twelve grade school systems. We are assessing our entry into this potential market through several pilot tests. Preliminary results of our exploration of this market have been mixed, but we believe it may represent a new addressable market for our mobile audio/video recording products in the future. Recent tragic events at schools have heightened the need for providing a “safer” environment in general for schools.
Private Security Companies
 
There are thousands of private security agencies in the United States employing a large number of guards. Police forces use video systems for proof of correct conduct by officers, but private security services usually have no such tool. We believe that the FirstVU HD is an excellent management tool for these companies to monitor conduct and timing of security rounds. In addition to the FirstVU HD, the digital video security camera can provide fill-in security when guards have large areas to cover or in areas that do not have to be monitored around the clock.
Homeland Security Market
 
In addition to the government, U.S. corporations are spending heavily for protection against the potential of terrorist attacks. Public and private-sector outlays for antiterrorism measures and for protection against other forms of violence are significant. These are potential markets for our products.
Manufacturing
 
We have entered into contracts with manufacturers for the assembly of the printed circuit boards used in our products. Dedicated circuit board manufacturers are well-suited to the assembly of circuit boards with the complexity found in our products. Dedicated board manufacturers can spread the extensive capital equipment costs of circuit board assembly among multiple projects and customers. Such manufacturers also have the volume to enable the frequent upgrade to state-of-the-art equipment. We have identified multiple suppliers who meet our quality, cost, and performance criteria. We also use more than one source for circuit board assembly to ensure a reliable supply over time. We use contract manufacturers to manufacture our component subassemblies and may eventually use them to perform final assembly and testing. Due to the complexity of our products, we believe that it is important to maintain a core of knowledgeable production personnel for consistent quality and to limit the dissemination of sensitive intellectual property and will continue this practice. In addition, such technicians are valuable in our service and repair business to support our growing installed customer base.

We also contract with two manufacturers that have manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and South Korea to produce our DVM-250 Plus, DVM-800 and DVM-800 HD products. The contracts are general in nature addressing confidentiality and other matters, have no minimum purchase requirements and require the acceptance of specific purchase orders to support any product supply acquisitions. We are using additional contract manufacturers based in the United States for these product lines to further mitigate any supply disruption risk and ensure competitive pricing. We typically perform final assembly, testing and quality control functions for these products in our Lenexa, Kansas facility.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We have an employee-based, direct sales force for domestic selling efforts that enables us to control and monitor its daily activities and independent distributors for international sales. Our sales force is organized in seven territories. The direct territory sales team is supported by a team of five inside sales representatives, and a tele-sales specialist and a pre-sales solution design team. We also have a bid specialist to coordinate large bid opportunities. We believe our employee-based model encourages our sales personnel in lower performing territories to improve their efforts and, consequently, their sales results. Our executive team also supports sales agents with significant customer opportunities by providing pricing strategies and customer presentation assistance. Our technical support personnel may also provide sales agents with customer presentations and product specifications in order to facilitate sales activities.
 
We use our direct sales force and international distributors to market our products. Our key promotional activities include:
 

● | attendance at industry trade shows and conventions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | direct sales, with a force of industry-specific sales individuals who identify, call upon and build on-going relationships with key purchasers and targeted industries; 
● | support of our direct sales with passive sales systems, including inside sales and e-commerce; 
● | print advertising in journals with specialized industry focus; 
● | direct mail campaigns targeted to potential customers; 
● | web advertising, including supportive search engines and website and registration with appropriate sourcing entities; 
● | our NASCAR relationship is supportive of developing new business opportunities by and between the sponsors at NASCAR sponsored events in addition to the races; 
● | public relations, industry-specific venues, as well as general media, to create awareness of our brand and our products, including membership in appropriate trade organizations; and 
● | brand identification through trade names associated with us and our products. 

Competition
 
The law enforcement and security surveillance markets are extremely competitive. Competitive factors in these industries include ease of use, quality, portability, versatility, reliability, accuracy and cost. There are direct competitors with technology and products in the law enforcement and surveillance markets for all our products and those we have in development. Many of these competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources, more extensive distribution channels, larger customer bases and faster response times to adapt new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our primary competitors in the in-car video systems market include L-3 Mobile-Vision, Inc., Coban Technologies, Inc., WatchGuard, Kustom Signals, Panasonic System Communications Company, International Police Technologies, Inc. and a number of other competitors who sell, or may in the future sell, in-car video systems to law enforcement agencies. Our primary competitors in the body-worn camera market include Axon, Reveal Media, WatchGuard and VieVU, Inc., which was acquired by Axon in 2018. We face similar and intense competitive factors for our event recorders in the mass transit markets as we do in the law enforcement and security surveillance markets. We will also compete with any company making surveillance devices for commercial use. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in these markets. Further, there can be no assurance that new and existing companies will not enter the law enforcement and security surveillance markets in the future.
 
The commercial fleet security and surveillance markets likewise are also very competitive. There are direct competitors for our DVM-250 Plus “event recorders,” which several may have greater financial, technical marketing, and manufacturing resources than we do. Our primary competitors in the commercial fleet sector include Lytx, Inc. (previously DriveCam, Inc.) and SmartDrive Systems.

Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our success in protecting our proprietary technology, both in the United States and abroad. We have filed for patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to cover certain design aspects of our products.
 
Some of our patent applications are still under review by the USPTO and, therefore, we have not yet been issued all the patents that we applied for in the United States. We were issued several patents in recent years, including a patent on our VuLink product that provides automatic triggering of our body-worn camera and our in-car video systems. No assurance can be given which, or any, of the patents relating to our existing technology will be issued from the United States or any foreign patent offices. Additionally, no assurance can be given that we will receive any patents in the future based on our continued development of our technology, or that our patent protection within and/or outside of the United States will be sufficient to deter others, legally or otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing our technologies.
 
We have entered into supply and distribution agreements with several companies that produce certain of our products, including our DVM-800 and DVM-800 HD products. These supply and distribution agreements contain certain confidentiality provisions that protect our proprietary technology, as well as that of the third party manufacturers.
 
In addition to seeking patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to seek to achieve and thereafter maintain a competitive advantage. Although we have entered into or intend to enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that we will be able to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.
 
Axon, a competitor in our body-camera market, requested that the USPTO commence an ex parte reexamination (“IPR”) of our U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (The “’292 Patent”). The USPTO granted this request and has completed its reexamination. The USPTO has confirmed the validity of our ’292 Patent which relates to our auto-activation technology for law enforcement body cameras. We have filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Axon, alleging willful patent infringement against Axon’s body camera product line. On February 2, 2016, we received notification that the USPTO has issued another patent relating to our auto-activation technology for law enforcement cameras. U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 (the “’452 Patent”) generally covers the automatic activation and coordination of multiple recording devices in response to a triggering event, such as a law enforcement officer activating the light bar on the vehicle. We have added Axon’s willful infringement of the ’452 Patent to our existing lawsuit. In December 2016 and January 2017, Axon filed two petitions for Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) against the ’452 Patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) rejected both of Axon’s petitions. Axon is now statutorily precluded from filing any more IPR petitions against the ’452 Patent. The District Court litigation in Kansas was temporarily stayed following the filing of the petitions for IPR. However, on November 17, 2017, the Federal District Court of Kansas rejected Axon’s request to maintain the stay. With this significant ruling, the parties will now proceed towards trial. Since litigation has resumed, the Court has issued a claim construction order (also called a Markman Order) where it sided with the Company on all disputes and denied Axon’s attempts to limit the scope of the claims. Following the Markman Order, the Court set all remaining deadlines in the case. Fact discovery closed on October 8, 2018, and a Final Pretrial Conference took place on January 16, 2019. The parties filed motions for summary judgment on January 31, 2019. The parties are awaiting a ruling from the Court on the summary judgment motions. The Court will set a trial date once summary judgment matters are resolved.
 
Despite the USPTO’s recognition of the validity of the ’292 Patent and ’452 Patent, AXON continues to offer for sale, sell, and market its Axon technology in disregard of our federally protected patent rights. As a result, we are aggressively challenging Axon’s infringing conduct in our lawsuit against it, seeking both monetary damages and a permanent injunction preventing Axon from continuing to sell its Axon Signal technology.
 
On May 27, 2016 we filed suit against WatchGuard, alleging patent infringement of our ’292 Patent, the ’452 Patent and our patent No. 9,325,950 (the “’950 Patent”) based on WatchGuard’s VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines. We intend to aggressively challenge WatchGuard’s infringing conduct in our lawsuit against it, seeking both monetary damages and a permanent injunction preventing WatchGuard from continuing to sell its auto-activation technology embodied within its body-worn and in-car video systems.

The USPTO has granted multiple patents to the Company with claims covering numerous features, such as automatically activating all deployed cameras in response to the activation of just one camera. Additionally, its patent claims cover automatic coordination as well as digital synchronization between multiple recording devices. Digital Ally also has patent coverage directed to the coordination between a multi-camera system and an officer’s smartphone, which allows an officer to more readily assess an event on the scene while an event is taking place or immediately after it has occurred.
 
The Company’s lawsuit alleges that WatchGuard incorporated this patented technology into its VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines without its permission. Specifically, Digital Ally is accusing WatchGuard of infringing three patents: the ’292 and ’452 Patents and “’950 Patent.” The Company is aggressively challenging WatchGuard’s infringing conduct, seeking both monetary damages, as well as seeking a permanent injunction preventing WatchGuard from continuing to sell its VISTA Wifi and 4RE In-Car product lines using Digital Ally’s own technology to compete against it. On May 8, 2017, WatchGuard filed a petition seeking IPR of the ’950 Patent. The Company will vigorously oppose that petition. On December 4, 2017 The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) rejected the request of WatchGuard to institute an “IPR” on the ’950 Patent. The ’292 Patent previously was subject to the IPR process with the USPTO, but in June 2018 the PTO found the ’292 Patent valid and rejected Axon’s arguments. WatchGuard had previously agreed to be bound by Axon’s IPRs and, as such, WatchGuard is now statutorily barred from any further IPR’s challenges with respect to the ’950, ’452, and ’292 Patents. Since the defeat of Axon’s ’292 Patent IPR, the Court has lifted the stay and set a schedule moving the case towards trial. Discovery is ongoing and will close on May 2, 2019. The parties will then proceed with expert reports and summary judgment. No trial date has been set.
 
We believe the outcome of these infringement lawsuits, and in particular the Axon lawsuit will have meaningful effects upon the entire body-worn camera market within the United States over the foreseeable future. The auto-activation technology protected by our ’292, ’452 and ’950 Patents is quickly becoming standard within the industry, therefore if we are successful in challenging Axon and WatchGuard’s infringing conduct, we believe it will have a substantial and positive impact upon our future revenue streams, although we can offer no assurances in this regard.
 
Employees
 
We had 95 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
