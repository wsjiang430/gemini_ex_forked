 Item 1.  Business
 Company Overview and History
 GMS Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a distributor of specialty building products including wallboard, suspended ceilings systems, or ceilings, steel framing and other complementary building products. We purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of wallboard and ceilings contractors and homebuilders and, to a lesser extent, general contractors and individuals. We operate a network of more than 250 distribution centers across the United States and Canada.  
 Since our founding in 1971, we have grown our business through a combination of strategic acquisitions, opening new branch locations (“greenfields”) and organic growth. On June 1, 2016, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of our common stock. On February 28, 2017, June 7, 2017 and December 14, 2017, certain of our stockholders completed secondary public offerings of our common stock. Following the secondary offering of our common stock on June 7, 2017, the control group consisting of certain affiliates of AEA Investors LP (“AEA”) and certain other of our stockholders no longer controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we are no longer a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) corporate governance standards.
 Acquisition of Titan
 On June 1, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of WSB Titan (“Titan”), a distributer of wallboard, lumber, insulation and other complementary commercial and residential building materials. Titan is Canada’s largest gypsum specialty distributer with 30 locations across five provinces in Canada. The stated purchase price was $627.0 million ($800.0 million Canadian dollars). As part of the consideration, certain members of existing Titan management converted $35.0 million of their ownership position in Titan into equity that is exchangeable for the Company’s stock. The transaction extended our leadership position in North America with additional scale and footprint, expanded our geographic coverage into the Canadian market and has created opportunities for product expansion in both the United States and Canada.
 To finance this transaction, on June 1, 2018, we entered into a Third Amendment to our First Lien Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) that provides for a new first lien term loan facility under the credit agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $996.8 million due in June 2025 that bears interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 2.75%, representing a 25 basis point improvement compared to the interest rate of the existing first lien term loan facility under the credit agreement immediately prior to giving effect to the Third Amendment. We also drew down $143.0 million under our asset backed revolving credit facility. The net proceeds from the new first lien term loan facility, asset backed revolving credit facility and cash on hand were used to repay our existing first lien term loan facility of approximately $571.8 million and to finance the Titan acquisition.
 Our Growth Strategy
 Our growth strategy entails taking market share within our existing footprint, expanding into new markets by opening new branches and through strategic acquisitions, and expanding our product lines. We expect to continue to capture profitable market share in our existing footprint by delivering industry-leading customer service. Our usual strategy for opening new branches is to further penetrate markets that are adjacent to our existing operations. Typically, we have pre-existing customer relationships in these markets but need a new location to fully capitalize on those relationships. In addition, we will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions. Due to the large, highly fragmented nature

of our market and our reputation throughout the industry, we believe we have the potential to access a robust acquisition pipeline that will continue to supplement our organic growth. We use a rigorous targeting process to identify acquisition candidates that will fit our culture and business model and have an experienced team of professionals to manage the acquisition and integration processes. As a result of our scale, purchasing power and ability to improve operations through implementing best practices, we believe we can achieve substantial synergies and drive earnings accretion from our acquisition strategy.
 Products
 We provide a comprehensive product offering of wallboard, ceilings, steel framing and complementary interior construction products. By carrying a full line of wallboard and ceilings along with steel framing and ancillary products, we are able to serve as a one-stop-shop for our customers. For information on net sales of our products, see Note 17, “Segments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Wallboard
 Wallboard is one of the most widely used building products for interior and exterior walls and ceilings in residential and commercial structures due to its low cost, ease of installation and superior performance in providing comfort, fire resistance, thermal insulation, sound insulation, mold and moisture resistance, impact resistance, aesthetics and design elements. Wallboard is sold in panels of various dimensions, suited to various applications. In commercial and institutional construction projects, architectural specifications and building codes provide requirements related to the thickness of the panels and, in some cases, other characteristics, including fire resistance. In addition, there are wallboard products that provide some additional value in use. These include lighter weight panels, panels with additional sound insulation, and panels coated to provide mold and moisture resistance. In addition to the interior wallboard products described above, exterior sheathing is a water-resistant wallboard product designed for attachment to exterior side-wall framing as an underlayment for various exterior siding materials. These panels are manufactured with a treated, water-resistant core faced with water-repellent paper on both face and back surfaces and long edges.
     While highly visible and essential, wallboard typically comprises only 3% to 5% of a new home's total cost. Given its low price point relative to other materials, we believe that there is no economical substitute for wallboard in either residential or commercial applications. We believe wallboard demand is driven by a balanced mix of both residential and commercial new construction as well as repair and remodeling (“R&R”) activity.
     Ceilings
     Our ceilings product line consists of suspended mineral fiber, soft fiber and metal ceiling systems primarily used in offices, hotels, hospitals, retail facilities, schools and a variety of other commercial and institutional buildings. The principal components of our ceiling systems are typically square mineral fiber tiles and the metal grid that holds the tile in place. The systems vary by acoustical performance characteristics, reflectivity, color, fire protection and aesthetic appeal. In addition to these systems, we have expanded our ceilings product offering to include architectural specialty ceilings. This product line consists of a variety of specialty shapes that provide a room with a unique visual effect as well as enhanced acoustical performance. As a result of the specified, often customized nature of these products, architectural specialty ceilings are a growing, high margin component of our product offering.
     Our ceilings product line is almost exclusively sold into commercial and institutional applications. Because interior contractors who purchase ceilings frequently buy wallboard from the same distributor, carrying our ceilings product line helps increase our sales of wallboard and other complementary products, which are often delivered together with ceilings to the same worksite as part of a commercial package.
     In the ceilings market, brand is highly valued and often specified by the architect of a commercial building. Because of our strong market position, we have exclusive access to the leading ceilings brand in many of our local markets. Where we have exclusivity, these specifications help us drive sales of ceilings products as well as all of the complementary products we sell as part of our commercial package. In effect, our exclusivity on the leading ceiling tile brand creates a cycle which helps reinforce our market position in our other products. In addition, because ceiling tile systems differ in size, shape and aesthetic appeal between manufacturers, they are often replaced with the same brand for R&R projects. As a result, the leading brand's installed base of product generates built-in demand for replacement

product over time. Because we have exclusive access to that brand in certain markets, we benefit from these recurring sales.
     Steel Framing

Our steel framing product line consists of steel track, studs and the various other steel products used to frame the interior walls of a commercial or institutional building. Typically the contractor who installs the steel framing also installs the wallboard, and the two products, along with ceilings, insulation and other products are sold together as part of a commercial package. Nearly all of our steel framing products are sold for use in commercial buildings. Other Products

In addition to our three primary product lines, we offer our customers complementary products, including insulation, lumber, ready-mix joint compound and various other interior construction products as well as ancillary products they need to complete the job including tools and safety products. We partner with leading branded vendors for many of these products and merchandise them in showrooms that are adjacent to many of our warehouses. In recent years, through specific initiatives and acquisitions, including Titan, we have expanded our complementary and ancillary product lines in order to further solidify our position as a one-stop-shop for the interior contractor and gain a greater share of their purchases. Our Industry
     As the construction market in the North America evolved during the second half of the 20th century, contractors began to specialize in specific trades within the construction process, and specialty distributors emerged to supply them. Wallboard and ceilings installation were some of these trades, and we, along with other specialty distributors, tailored our product offerings and service capabilities to meet the unique needs of those trades. Today, specialty distributors comprise the preferred distribution channel for wallboard and ceilings in both the commercial and residential construction markets.
     We believe the success of the specialty distribution model in wallboard and ceilings is driven by the strong value proposition provided to our customers. Given the logistical complexity of the distribution services we provide, the expertise needed to execute effectively, and the special equipment required, we believe specialty distributors focused on wallboard and ceilings are best suited to meet contractors’ needs. The main drivers for our products are commercial new construction, commercial R&R, residential new construction and residential R&R.
     Commercial
     Our addressable commercial construction market is comprised of a variety of commercial and institutional sub-segments with varying demand drivers. Our commercial markets include offices, hotels, retail stores and other commercial buildings, while our institutional markets include educational facilities, healthcare facilities, government buildings and other institutional facilities. The principal demand drivers across these markets include the overall economic outlook, the general business cycle, government spending, vacancy rates, employment trends, interest rates, availability of credit and demographic trends.
     We believe commercial R&R spending is typically more stable than new commercial construction activity. Commercial R&R spending is driven by a number of factors, including commercial real estate prices and rental rates, office vacancy rates, government spending and interest rates. Commercial R&R spending is also driven by commercial lease expirations and renewals, as well as tenant turnover. Such events often result in repair, reconfiguration and/or upgrading of existing commercial space.
     Residential
    
Residential construction activity is driven by a number of factors, including the overall economic outlook, employment, income growth, home prices, availability of mortgage financing and related government regulations, interest rates and consumer confidence, among others.

     We believe residential R&R activity is typically more stable than new residential construction activity. The primary drivers of residential R&R spending include changes in existing home prices, existing home sales, the average age of the housing stock, consumer confidence and interest rates.
     Customers

Our diverse customer base consists of more than 34,500 contractors as well as homebuilders. We maintain local relationships with our contractors through our network of branches and our extensive salesforce. We also serve our large homebuilder customers through our local branches, but are able to coordinate the relationships on a national basis through our corporate facility. Our ability to serve multi-regional homebuilders across their footprints provides value to them and differentiates us from most of our competitors. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, our single largest customer accounted for 2.0% and 1.9% of our net sales, respectively, and our top ten customers accounted for 8.8% and 8.5% of our net sales, respectively. Suppliers

Our leading market position, North American footprint and superior service capabilities have allowed us to develop strong relationships with our suppliers. We maintain exceptional, long-term relationships with all seven major North American wallboard manufacturers, as well as the three major ceilings manufacturers: Armstrong World Industries, Inc., or Armstrong, CertainTeed Corporation and USG Corporation, or USG. Because we account for a meaningful portion of their volumes and provide them with an extensive salesforce to market their products, we are viewed by our suppliers as a key channel partner and often have exclusive relationships with these suppliers in certain markets. We believe this position provides us with advantaged procurement. Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing strategy is to provide a comprehensive suite of high-quality products and superior services to contractors and builders reliably, safely, accurately and on-time. We have a highly experienced sales force who manage our customer relationships and grow our customer base. We have strategies to increase our customer base at both the corporate and local branch levels, which focus on building and growing strong relationships with our customers, whether they serve a small local market, or a national footprint. We believe that the experience and expertise of our salesforce differentiates us from our competition particularly in the commercial market, which requires a highly technical and specialized product knowledge and a sophisticated delivery plan. Competition

We compete against other specialty distributors as well as big box retailers and lumberyards. Among specialty distributors, we compete against a small number of large distributors and many small, local, privately-owned distributors. Our largest competitors include: Allied Building Products (a subsidiary of Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.), Foundation Building Materials and L&W Supply Co. Inc (a subsidiary of ABC Supply Company). However, we believe smaller, regional or local competitors still comprise approximately half of the North American specialty distribution market. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and expertise; advisory or other service capabilities; delivery capabilities; pricing of products; and availability of credit. Seasonality

In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been slightly higher in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may be impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects.

 Intellectual Property

We own United States trademark registrations for approximately 31 trademarks that we use in our business. Generally, registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are renewed on a timely basis and continue to be used properly as trademarks. We intend to maintain these trademark registrations as long as they remain valuable to our business. Other than certain of our local brands, the retention of which we believe helps maintain customer loyalty, we do not believe our business is dependent to a material degree on trademarks, patents, copyrights or trade secrets. In addition, other than commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses for third-party intellectual property are material to our business, taken as a whole. Employees

As of April 30, 2019, we had over 5,800 employees. We do not have a significant amount of employees affiliated with labor unions. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. Additionally, we believe that the training provided through our employee development programs and our entrepreneurial, performance-based culture provides significant benefits to our employees. Government Regulation
     While we are not engaged in a “regulated industry,” we are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local government regulations applicable to the business in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, workplace safety, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We strive to operate each of our branches in accordance with applicable laws, codes and regulations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and, in addition, that our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices comply with related regulations.
     Our operations in domestic interstate commerce are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, or DOT, which has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. We are subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. Vehicle dimension and driver hours of service also are subject to both federal and state regulations. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Federal, state, local and other regulations could impose substantial costs and restrictions on our operations that would reduce our net income.” Our operations are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, which has broad administrative powers with respect to workplace and jobsite safety.
     Environmental, Health and Safety
     We are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, air emissions, water discharges, waste management and disposal, product safety and workplace health and safety. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on our operations and the products we distribute. The failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, damage to property or natural resources and personal injury, requirements to investigate or clean up property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup, or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions and could negatively impact our reputation with customers. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, the products we distribute and the business of our customers, and the interpretation or enforcement of these laws and regulations, are constantly evolving and it is impossible to predict accurately the effect that changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Should environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, become more stringent, our costs, or the costs of our customers, could increase, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
