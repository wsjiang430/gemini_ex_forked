 Item 1. Business
The Company is a Canadian corporation that was formed in March 1994 as a result of an amalgamation between WGIM Acquisition Corp. and the former IMAX Corporation (Predecessor IMAX). Predecessor IMAX was incorporated in 1967. 
GENERAL 
 The Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution combining proprietary software, theater architecture and equipment to create the highest-quality, most immersive motion picture experience for which the IMAX® brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and studios utilize IMAX theaters to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and as a result, IMAXs theater network is among the most important and successful theatrical distribution platforms for major event films around the world. 
 The Companys core business consists of: 
 

 | the Digital Re-Mastering (DMR) of films into the IMAX format for exhibition in the IMAX theater network in exchange for a certain percentage of contingent box office receipts from both studios and exhibitors; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the provision of IMAX premium theater systems (IMAX theater systems) to exhibitor customers through sales, long-term leases or joint revenue sharing arrangements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 IMAX theater systems are based on proprietary and patented technology developed over the course of the Companys 51-year history. The Companys customers who purchase, lease or otherwise acquire the IMAX theater systems through joint revenue sharing arrangements are theater exhibitors that operate commercial theaters (particularly multiplexes), museums, science centers, or destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own IMAX theaters, but licenses the use of its trademarks along with the sale, lease or contribution of the IMAX theater system. The Company refers to all theaters using the IMAX theater system as IMAX theaters. 
 IMAX theater systems combine: 
 

 | the ability to exhibit content that has undergone IMAX DMR conversion, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewers peripheral vision and creates more realistic images;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 Together these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive and exciting experience than a traditional theater. 
 As a result of the immersiveness and superior image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience, the Companys exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX DMR films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX DMR films, generates incremental box office for the Companys exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX theater network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX DMR films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films. 
 As one of the worlds leaders in entertainment technology, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. The Company recently introduced IMAX with Laser, the Companys next-generation laser projection system designed for IMAX theaters in commercial multiplexes. The Company believes that IMAX with Laser delivers increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that IMAX with Laser can help facilitate the next major contract renewal and upgrade cycle for the global commercial IMAX network.

 To date the Company has signed IMAX with Laser agreements with leading, global exhibitors such as AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC), Cineworld Group PLC (Cineworld) and Les Cinémas Pathé Gaumont (Pathé) (among others) for a total of 59 new theaters, 114 upgrades to existing IMAX theaters, and 30 upgrades to existing backlog arrangements. As at December 31, 2018, the Companys backlog had 73 new IMAX with Laser systems and 98 upgrades to IMAX with Laser systems and expects to have approximately 135 IMAX with Laser systems installed by the end of 2019. 
 IMAX THEATER NETWORK 
 The Company believes the IMAX theater network is one of the most extensive premium theater networks in the world with 1,505 theater systems (1,409 commercial multiplex, 14 commercial destination, 82 institutional) operating in 80 countries as at December 31, 2018. 
 The Company believes that over time its commercial multiplex theater network could grow to approximately 2,855 IMAX theaters worldwide from the 1,409 commercial multiplex IMAX theaters in operation as at December 31, 2018. While the Company continues to grow in the United States and Canada, it believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As at December 31, 2018, 70.1% of IMAX theater systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada), up from 67.2% as at December 31, 2017, and approximately 86.2% of the new IMAX theater systems in backlog are scheduled to be installed in international markets, compared to 90.2% as at December 31, 2017. Revenues and gross box office derived from outside the United States and Canada continue to exceed revenues and gross box-office from the United States and Canada. 
 Greater China continues to be the Companys second-largest market, measured by revenues, with approximately 31% of overall revenues generated from the Companys China operations in 2018. As at December 31, 2018, the Company had 639 theaters operating in Greater China and an additional 272 new theaters in backlog that are scheduled to be installed in Greater China by 2022. The Companys backlog in Greater China represents 58.7% of the Companys current backlog for new IMAX theater systems. The Companys largest single international partnership is in China with Wanda Film, formerly Wanda Cinema Line Corporation (Wanda). Wandas total commitment to the Company is for 359 theater systems, of which 344 theater systems are under the parties joint revenue sharing arrangement. 
 The Company indirectly owns approximately 67.96% of IMAX China Holding, Inc. (IMAX China), whose shares trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. IMAX China remains a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 
 The Company believes it is the worlds largest designer and manufacturer of specialty premium projection and sound system components for large-format theaters around the world, and it is also a significant producer and distributor of large-format films. The Companys theater systems include specialized IMAX projectors, advanced sound systems and specialty screens. 
 The Companys principal products and services are as follows: 
 

 | IMAX DMR: The Digital Re-Mastering of films into the IMAX format for exhibition in the IMAX theater network.

 These product lines do not reflect the nature and sources of revenue, or the manner in which management reviews financial information. The Companys segmented information is provided in Item 7 and note 19 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2018 (this 2018 Form 10-K), which is incorporated by reference into this Item I. 
 Digital Re-Mastering (IMAX DMR) 
 The Company has developed a proprietary technology, known as IMAX DMR, to digitally re-master Hollywood films into IMAX digital cinema package format or 15/70-format film for exhibition in IMAX theaters. IMAX DMR digitally enhances the image 
 
5 


  resolution of motion picture films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. 
 The IMAX DMR process involves the following: 
 

 | in certain instances, scanning, at the highest possible resolution, each individual frame of the movie and converting it into a digital image;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | optimizing the image using proprietary image enhancement tools;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhancing the digital image using techniques such as sharpening, color correction, grain and noise removal and the elimination of unsteadiness and removal of unwanted artifacts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | recording the enhanced digital image into an IMAX digital cinema package (DCP) format or onto IMAX 15/70-format film; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | specially re-mastering the sound track to take full advantage of the unique sound system of IMAX theater systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited in the IMAX theater network is re-mastered for the IMAX digital sound systems in connection with the IMAX DMR release. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX re-mastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position. 
 IMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release, and filmmakers and studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting select scenes with IMAX cameras to increase the audiences immersion in the film and taking advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio. For example, Marvels Avengers: Infinity War, which was released in April 2018, was shot in its entirety using IMAX cameras, and Avengers: Endgame, scheduled for release in April 2019, was also filmed entirely with IMAX cameras. In addition, in July 2018, Ant-Man and the Wasp and Mission: Impossible  Fallout was released with select scenes specifically formatted for IMAX screens, and in March 2019, Captain Marvel will be released with select scenes specifically formatted for IMAX screens. In addition, for Disneys The Lion King, scheduled for release in July 2019, director Jon Favreau filmed select scenes with IMAX cameras. 
 In 2018, 70 films were converted through the IMAX DMR process and released to theaters in the IMAX network by film studios as compared to 60 films in 2017. In addition, in April 2018, the Company, in conjunction with Panda Productions released an IMAX original production, Pandas. 
 To date, the Company has announced the following 29 DMR titles to be released in 2019 to the IMAX theater network. The following dates noted for film release are subject to change and may vary by territory.

 In addition, the Company will be releasing an IMAX original production, Superpower Dogs, in March 2019. 
 The Company remains in active negotiations with all of the major Hollywood studios for additional films to fill out its short and long-term film slate for the IMAX theater network in 2019. 
 IMAX Systems 
 The Companys primary products are its theater systems. The Companys digital projection systems include a projector that offers superior image quality and stability and a digital theater control system; a digital audio system delivering up to 12,000 watts of sound; a screen with a proprietary coating technology, and, if applicable, 3D glasses cleaning equipment. IMAXs digital projection system also operates without the need for analog film prints. Traditional IMAX film-based theater systems contain the same components as the digital projection systems but include a rolling loop 15/70-format projector and require the use of analog film prints. Since its introduction in 2008, the vast majority of the Companys theater sales have been digital systems. Furthermore, a majority of the Companys existing film-based theater systems have been upgraded, at a cost to the exhibitor, to IMAX digital systems. As part of the arrangement to sell or lease its theater systems, the Company provides extensive advice on theater planning and design and supervision of installation services. Theater systems are also leased or sold with a license for the use of the globally recognized IMAX brand. 
 The Companys digital projection system provides a premium and differentiated experience to moviegoers that is consistent with what they have come to expect from the IMAX brand, while providing for the compelling economics and flexibility that digital technology affords. 
 The terms of each arrangement vary according to the configuration of the theater system provided, the cinema market and the film distribution market relevant to the geographic location of the customer. 
 Revenue from theater business arrangements is recognized at a different time from when cash is collected. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7 and note 4 in Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K for further discussion on the Companys revenue recognition policies.

 IMAX Theater Backlog and Network 
 The Companys sales backlog is as follows:

(6) | Includes 27 new laser projection system configurations (three of the 27 new systems are IMAX with Laser projection system configurations) and five upgrades of existing locations to laser projection system configurations (three of the five upgrades are for the IMAX with Laser projection system configurations).
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The number of theater systems in the backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new theater system arrangements signed from year to year, which adds to backlog and the installation and acceptance of theater systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. Sales backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed theater system sale and lease agreements that the Company believes will be recognized as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated theater, as well as a variable consideration estimate, however it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues. The value of sales backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases or long-term conditional theater commitments. The value of theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements is excluded from the dollar value of sales backlog, although certain theater systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for theater system installations that are listed in sales backlog are valid and binding commitments. 
 From time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with a theater system installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue.

 In 2018, the Company installed 149 IMAX theater systems in new locations. The Company estimates that it will install a similar number of new theater systems (excluding upgrades) in 2019. The Company cautions, however, that theater system installations may slip from period to period over the course of the Companys business, usually for reasons beyond its control. 
 IMAX theater systems consist of the following configurations: 
 IMAX Digital: Xenon Theater Systems
 The vast majority of the Companys theater system signings have been for the Companys proprietary xenon-based digital systems. The Company believes that its xenon-based digital projection system delivers high quality imagery compared with other xenon systems. Although the Company has introduced a new laser-based digital projection solution, the Company does not believe this will decrease the number of xenon-based digital theater systems installed in the immediate future. As at December 31, 2018, the Company had installed 1,346 xenon-based digital theater systems and has an additional 381 xenon-based digital theater systems in its backlog. 
IMAX Digital: Laser Theater Systems 
 At the end of 2014, the Company introduced its laser-based digital projection system. As a result of continued research and development aimed at creating a solution that is more affordable for its commercial multiplex partners, the Company rolled out IMAX with Laser in 2018, the Companys next-generation laser projection system designed for IMAX theaters in commercial multiplexes. The Company believes IMAX laser-based digital projectors present greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, consume less power and last longer than other digital projection technologies, and are capable of illuminating the largest screens in the IMAX theater network. As at December 31, 2018, the Company had installed 59 laser-based digital systems as compared to 51 as at December 31, 2017. As at December 31, 2018, the Company had installed 37 IMAX with Laser systems. 
IMAX Flat Screen and IMAX Dome Theater Systems
 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome systems primarily have been installed in institutions such as museums and science centers. Flat screen IMAX theaters were introduced in 1970, while IMAX dome theaters, which are designed for tilted dome screens, were introduced in 1973. There have been several significant proprietary and patented enhancements to these systems since their introduction. As at December 31, 2018, there were 44 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems in the IMAX network, as compared to 48 IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems as at December 31, 2017. With the introduction of the IMAX digital theater systems, there has been a decrease in the number of IMAX flat screen and IMAX dome theater systems in the network. With the introduction of laser-based digital systems, the Company has been able to create a new Laser Dome solution for its institutional customers. As at December 31, 2018, the Company had installed two IMAX with Laser Domes, which are included in the above numbers. 
 
9 


 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR Theater Systems
 IMAX 3D theaters utilize a flat screen 3D system, which produces realistic 3D images on an IMAX screen. As at December 31, 2018, there were 19 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR theater systems in operation compared to 21 IMAX 3D GT and IMAX 3D SR theater systems in operation as at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the number of 3D GT and 3D SR theater systems is largely attributable to the conversion of existing 3D GT and 3D SR theater systems to IMAX digital theater systems. 
 New Business Initiatives 
 In recent years, the Company has been exploring several new lines of business outside of its core business.
 IMAX Home Entertainment Technologies and Services 
 In September 2018, the Company announced a new home entertainment licensing and certification program called IMAX Enhanced. This initiative was launched along with audio leader DTS (an Xperi subsidy), capitalizing on the companies decades of combined expertise in image and sound science. The certification program combines high-end consumer electronics products with IMAX digitally re-mastered 4K high dynamic range (HDR) content and DTS audio technologies to offer consumers immersive sight and sound experiences for the home. 
 To be accepted into the program, leading consumer electronics manufacturers must design 4K HDR televisions, A/V receivers, sound systems and other home theater equipment to meet a carefully prescribed set of audio and video performance standards, set by a certification committee of IMAX and DTS engineers and some of Hollywoods leading technical specialists. 
 The program will digitally re-master content to produce more vibrant colors, greater contrast and sharper clarity, and will also deliver an IMAX signature sound experience. 
 IMAX Enhanced Program launch partners include Sony Electronics, Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Sound United. 
 In 2013, the Company established a joint venture with TCL Multimedia Technology Holding Limited (TCL) to design, develop, manufacture and sell a premium home theater system. The Company does not intend to invest significant capital into the joint venture going forward, and instead expects any additional funding to be provided through third party capital. 
Original Content 
 The Company has created two film funds to help finance the production of original content. The Company formed the IMAX China Film Fund (the China Film Fund) with its subsidiary IMAX China, its partner CMC and several other large investors to help fund Mandarin language commercial films. The China Film Fund targets productions that can leverage the Companys brand, relationships, technology and release windows in China. 
 In addition, the Companys IMAX Original Film Fund (the Original Film Fund) was established in 2014 to co-finance a portfolio of 10 original large format films. The initial investment in the Film Fund was committed to by a third party in the amount of $25.0 million, with the possibility of contributing additional funds. The Company has contributed $9.0 million to the Original Film Fund since 2014, and has reached its maximum contribution. The Company sees the Original Film Fund as a vehicle designed to generate a continuous, steady flow of high-quality documentary content. As at December 31, 2018, the Original Film Fund has invested $20.9 million toward the development of original films. 
 In 2017, the Company partnered with Marvel Television Inc. (Marvel) and Disney|ABC Television Group to co-produce and premiere theatrically the television series Marvels Inhumans in IMAX theaters. The first two episodes of the series ran worldwide in IMAX theaters for two weeks in September 2017 and subsequently the series premiered on the ABC network in the U.S. and across other networks internationally. 
 The Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute a broad variety of original content, especially during shoulder periods. However, the Company does not expect to make meaningful direct investments in original content going forward. 
 
10 


 Virtual Reality 
 In 2017, the Company piloted a virtual reality (VR) initiative which included several pilot IMAX VR Centers located in a number of multiplexes, as well as a stand-alone venue, each retrofitted with proprietary VR pods that permitted interactive, moveable VR experiences. 
 The Company also established its VR Fund among the Company, its subsidiary IMAX China and other strategic investors to help finance the creation of interactive VR content experiences for use across all VR platforms, including in the pilot IMAX VR Centers. 
 In December 2018, the Company announced, in connection with its strategic review of its VR pilot initiative, that it had decided to close its remaining VR locations and write-off certain VR content investments. In January 2019, the Company decided to dissolve the VR Fund. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has recognized asset impairment and exit costs related to its VR investments of $7.2 million. For additional information refer to note 24 in Item 8 of this 2018 Form 10-K.
Other 
 The Company is also a distributor of large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company generally distributes films which it produces or for which it has acquired distribution rights from independent producers. The Company receives either a percentage of the theater box office receipts or a fixed amount as a distribution fee. 
 The ownership rights to such films may be held by the film sponsors, the film investors and/or the Company. As at December 31, 2018, the Company currently has distribution rights with respect to 47 of such films, which cover subjects such as space, wildlife, music, history and natural wonders. 
 Several more recent large-format films that have been distributed by the Company include: Pandas, which was released in April 2018 and has grossed over $6.8 million as at the end of 2018; A Beautiful Planet, which was released in April 2016 and has grossed over $24.1 million as at the end of 2018; Voyage of Time, which was released in October 2016 and has grossed over $0.5 million as at the end of 2018; Island of Lemurs: Madagascar, which was released in April 2014 and has grossed over $14.1 million as at the end of 2018; Journey to the South Pacific, which was released in 2013 and has grossed $14.1 million as at the end of 2018. Large-format films have significantly longer exhibition periods than conventional commercial films and many of the films in the large-format library have remained popular for many decades, including the films SPACE STATION, Hubble 3D and T-REX: Back to the Cretaceous. 
 In addition, the Company also provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films (whether produced internally or externally), and digital post-production services. The Company derives a small portion of its revenues from other sources including: two owned and operated IMAX theaters; a commercial arrangement with one theater resulting in the sharing of profits and losses; the provision of management services to four other theaters; renting its proprietary 2D and 3D large-format film and digital cameras to third-party production companies; and also offering production advice and technical assistance to both documentary and Hollywood filmmakers. 
 As at December 31, 2018, the Company had two (December 31, 2017  two) owned and operated IMAX theaters. In addition, the Company has a commercial arrangement with one theater resulting in the sharing of profits and losses and provides management services to three other theaters. In January 2019, the Company closed its owned and operated theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota and now has one remaining owned and operated theater in Sacramento, California. The Company also rents its proprietary 2D and 3D large-format film and digital cameras to third party production companies. The Company maintains cameras and other film equipment and also offers production advice and technical assistance to both documentary and Hollywood filmmakers. 
 MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS

 INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
 Competition 
 The out-of-home entertainment industry is very competitive, and the Company faces a number of competitive challenges. In recent years, for instance, exhibitors and entertainment technology companies have introduced their own branded, large-screen 3D auditoriums or other proprietary theater systems, some of which include laser-based projectors, and in many cases, have marketed those auditoriums or theater systems as having similar quality or attributes as an IMAX theater. The Company believes that all of these alternative formats deliver images and experiences that are inferior to The IMAX Experience. 
 The Company may continue to face competition in the future from companies in the entertainment industry with new technologies and/or substantially greater capital resources to develop and support them. The Company also faces in-home competition from a number of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Blu-ray Disc, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television. The Company further competes for the publics leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including gaming, sporting events, concerts, live theater, social media and restaurants. 
 The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the value of the IMAX brand name, the premium IMAX consumer experience, the design, quality and historic reliability rate of IMAX theater systems, the return on investment of an IMAX theater, the number and quality of IMAX films that it distributes, the relationships the Company maintains with prominent Hollywood and international filmmakers, a number of whom desire to film their movies with IMAX cameras, the quality of the sound system components included with the IMAX theater, the availability of Hollywood and international event films to IMAX theaters through IMAX DMR technology, consumer loyalty and the level of the Companys service and maintenance and extended warranty efforts. The Company believes that its laser-based projection system increases further the technological superiority of the consumer experience it delivers. As a result, the Company believes that virtually all of the best performing premium theaters in the world are IMAX theaters.

 Exhibitor Consolidation 
 The Companys primary customers are commercial multiplex exhibitors. The commercial exhibition industry has undergone significant consolidation in recent years, with Dalian Wandas acquisitions of AMC and Hoyts Group in 2012 and 2015, respectively, and AMCs acquisition of Carmike Cinemas and Odeon & UCI Cinemas Group (Odeon), which includes Nordic Cinema Group (Nordic), in 2016. In 2018, the industry continues to consolidate, as evidenced by Cineworld Groups acquisition of Regal Entertainment Group, the Companys second largest customer. 
 The Company believes that recent exhibitor consolidation has helped facilitate the growth of the Companys theater network. The Company has historically enjoyed strong relationships with large commercial exhibitor chains, which have greater capital to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire IMAX theater systems. As larger commercial chains such as AMC have purchased smaller chains, those smaller chains have in turn become part of the IMAX theater network. For instance, following AMCs acquisition of Odeon and Nordic, the Company and AMC entered into an agreement for 25 new IMAX theater systems across the Odeon and Nordic theater network. The Company believes that continued consolidation could facilitate further signings and other strategic benefits going forward. 
 However, exhibitor consolidation has also resulted in individual exhibitor chains constituting a material portion of the Companys revenue and network. Continued industry consolidation (as well as consolidation in the movie studio industry) may present risks to the Company. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 2018 Form 10-K.
THE IMAX BRAND 
 IMAX is a world leader in entertainment technology. The Company relies on its brand to communicate its leadership and singular goal of creating entertainment experiences that exceed all expectations. Top filmmakers and studios use the IMAX brand to message that a film will connect with audiences in unique and extraordinary ways. The IMAX brand is a promise to deliver what todays movie audiences crave  a memorable, more emotionally engaging, more thrilling and shareable experience. Consumer research conducted in six countries worldwide by a leading third-party research firm shows that the IMAX brand has near universal awareness, creates a special experience and is one of the most differentiated movie-going brands. On a standardized measure of brand equity, the IMAX brand ranged from two to 10 times more powerful than other entertainment technology brands. The Company believes that its strong brand equity supports consumers predisposition to choose IMAX over competing brands and to pay a premium for The IMAX Experience now and into the future. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 The Company believes that it is one of the worlds leading entertainment technology companies with significant proprietary expertise in digital and film-based projection and sound system component design, engineering and imaging technology, particularly in laser-based technology. In recent years, the Company increased its level of research and development in order to develop laser-based projection systems. The Company rolled out its laser-based projection system at the end of 2014, which is capable of illuminating the largest screens in the Companys network. The laser-based projection system provides greater brightness and clarity, higher contrast, a wider color gamut and deeper blacks, while consuming less power and lasting longer than existing digital technology, to ensure that the Company continues to provide the highest quality, premier movie going experience available to consumers. In 2018, the Company rolled-out IMAX with Laser, the Companys next generation laser-based projection system, which is targeted primarily for screens in commercial multiplexes. With most of the laser development completed, the Company expects their research and development efforts will center around innovation projects and DMR enhancements in 2019. 
 Going forward, the Company plans to continue research and development activity in the future in other areas considered important to the Companys continued commercial success, including further improving the reliability of its projectors; enhancing the Companys image quality; expanding the applicability of the Companys digital technology in both theater and home entertainment; developing IMAX theater systems capabilities; and improving the Companys proprietary DMR process. Furthermore, due to the increasing success major Hollywood filmmakers have experienced with IMAX cameras, the Company has identified the development and manufacture of additional IMAX cameras as an important research and development project and is working with other parties on this initiative. 
 As at December 31, 2018, 86 of the Companys employees were connected with research and development projects.

 MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE 
 Projector Component Manufacturing 
 The Company assembles the projector of its theater systems at its office in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada (near Toronto). The Company develops and designs all of the key elements of the proprietary technology involved in this component. Fabrication of a majority of parts and sub-assemblies is subcontracted to a group of carefully pre-qualified third-party suppliers. Manufacture and supply contracts are signed for the delivery of the component on an order-by-order basis. The Company believes its significant suppliers will continue to supply quality products in quantities sufficient to satisfy its needs. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the projector to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. In 2018, these projectors, including both the Companys xenon and laser-based projection systems, had reliability rates based on scheduled shows of approximately 99.9%. 
Sound System Component Manufacturing 
 The Company develops, designs and assembles the key elements of its theater sound system component. The standard IMAX theater sound system component comprises parts from a variety of sources, with approximately 50% of the materials of each sound system attributable to proprietary parts provided under original equipment manufacturers agreements with outside vendors. These proprietary parts include custom loudspeaker enclosures and horns, specialized amplifiers, and signal processing and control equipment. The Company inspects all parts and sub-assemblies, completes the final assembly and then subjects the sound system component to comprehensive testing individually and as a system prior to shipment. 
 Screen and Other Components 
 The Company purchases its screen component and glasses cleaning equipment from third parties. The standard screen system component is comprised of a projection screen manufactured to IMAX specifications and a frame to hang the projection screen. The proprietary glasses cleaning machine is a stand-alone unit that is connected to the theaters water and electrical supply to automate the cleaning of 3D glasses. 
Maintenance and Extended Warranty Services 
 The Company also provides ongoing maintenance and extended warranty services to IMAX theater systems. These arrangements are usually for a separate fee, although the Company often includes free service in the initial year of an arrangement. The maintenance and extended warranty arrangements include service, maintenance and replacement parts for theater systems. 
 To support the IMAX theater network, the Company has personnel stationed in major markets throughout the world who provide periodic and emergency maintenance and extended warranty services on existing theater systems. The Company provides various levels of maintenance and warranty services, which are priced accordingly. Under full service programs, Company personnel typically visit each theater every six months to provide preventative maintenance, cleaning and inspection services and emergency visits to resolve problems and issues with the theater system. Under some arrangements, customers can elect to participate in a service partnership program whereby the Company trains a customers technician to carry out certain aspects of maintenance. Under such shared maintenance arrangements, the Company participates in certain of the customers maintenance checks each year, provides a specified number of emergency visits and provides spare parts, as necessary. For both xenon and laser-based digital systems, the Company provides pre-emptive maintenance, remote system monitoring and a network operations center that provides continuous access to product experts.
