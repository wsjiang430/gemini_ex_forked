Item 1. | Business

Background
First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. is a self-administered and fully integrated real estate company which owns, manages, acquires, sells, develops and redevelops industrial real estate. The Company is a Maryland corporation organized on August 10, 1993 and a real estate investment trust ("REIT") as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). As of December 31, 2018, our in-service portfolio consisted of 171 bulk warehouse properties, 93 regional warehouse properties, 152 light industrial properties and 31 R&D/flex properties, containing an aggregate of approximately 60.7 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA") located in 21 states. Our in-service portfolio includes all properties that have reached stabilized occupancy (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased), developed and redeveloped properties one year from the date construction is completed and acquired properties that are at least 75% occupied at acquisition or one year from the acquisition date.
We began operations on July 1, 1994. The Company's operations are conducted primarily through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on November 23, 1993 of which the Company is the sole general partner (the "General Partner"), with an approximate 98.0% and 96.8% ownership interest ("General Partner Units") at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Operating Partnership also conducts operations through the Other Real Estate Partnerships, numerous limited liability companies ("LLCs") and certain taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), the operating data of which, together with that of the Operating Partnership, is consolidated with that of the Company as presented herein. The Company does not have any significant assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership and its 100% ownership interest in the general partners of the Other Real Estate Partnerships. Noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership of approximately 2.0% and 3.2% at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represents the aggregate partnership interest held by the limited partners thereof ("Limited Partner Units" and together with the General Partner Units, the "Units"). 
Profits, losses and distributions of the Operating Partnership, the LLCs, the Other Real Estate Partnerships and the TRSs are allocated to the general partner and the limited partners, the members or the shareholders, as applicable, of such entities in accordance with the provisions contained within their respective organizational documents.
We also own a 49% equity interest in, and provide various services to, a joint venture (the "Joint Venture") through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. The Joint Venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The operating data of the Joint Venture is not consolidated with that of the Company or the Operating Partnership as presented herein.
We utilize an operating approach which combines the effectiveness of decentralized, locally based property management, acquisition, sales and development functions with the cost efficiencies of centralized acquisition, sales and development support, capital markets expertise, asset management and fiscal control systems. At December 31, 2018, we had 145 employees.

Business Objectives and Growth Plans
Our fundamental business objective is to maximize the total return to the Company's stockholders and the Operating Partnership's partners through an increase in cash flows and increases in the value of our properties and operations. Our long-term business growth plans include the following elements:

• | Internal Growth. We seek to grow internally by (i) increasing revenues by renewing or re-leasing spaces subject to expiring leases at higher rental levels; (ii) contractual rent escalations on our long-term leases; (iii) increasing occupancy levels at properties where vacancies exist and maintaining occupancy elsewhere; (iv) controlling and minimizing property operating and general and administrative expenses; and (v) renovating existing properties.


• | External Growth. We seek to grow externally through (i) the development of industrial properties; (ii) the acquisition of portfolios of industrial properties or individual properties which meet our investment parameters within our target markets; (iii) the expansion of our properties; and (iv) possible additional joint venture investments.


• | Portfolio Enhancement. We continually seek to upgrade our overall portfolio via new investments as well as through the sale of select assets that we believe do not exhibit favorable characteristics for long-term cash flow growth.

Our ability to pursue our long-term growth plans is affected by market conditions and our financial condition and operating capabilities. See "Summary of Significant Transactions in 2018" under Item 7,"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Business Strategies
We utilize the following six strategies in connection with the operation of our business:

• | Organizational Strategy. We implement our decentralized property operations strategy through the deployment of experienced regional management teams and local property managers. We provide acquisition, development and financing assistance, asset management oversight and financial reporting functions from our headquarters in Chicago, Illinois to support our regional operations. We believe the size of our portfolio enables us to realize operating efficiencies by spreading overhead among many properties and by negotiating purchasing discounts.


• | Market Strategy. Our market strategy is to concentrate on the top industrial real estate markets in the United States. These markets have one or more of the following characteristics: (i) favorable industrial real estate fundamentals, including improving industrial demand and constrained supply that can lead to long-term rent growth; (ii) warehouse distribution markets with favorable economic and business environments that should benefit from increases in distribution activity driven by growth in global trade and local consumption; and (iii) sufficient size to provide ample opportunity for growth through incremental investments as well as offer asset liquidity.


• | Leasing and Marketing Strategy. We have an operational management strategy designed to enhance tenant satisfaction and portfolio performance. We pursue an active leasing strategy, which includes broadly marketing available space, seeking to renew existing leases at higher rents per square foot and seeking leases which provide for the pass-through of property-related expenses to the tenant. We also have local and national marketing programs which focus on the business and real estate brokerage communities and multi-national tenants.


• | Acquisition/Development Strategy. Our acquisition/development strategy is to invest in industrial properties in the top industrial real estate markets in the United States through the deployment of experienced regional management teams.


• | Disposition Strategy. We continually evaluate local market conditions and property-related factors in all of our markets for purposes of identifying assets suitable for disposition.


• | Financing Strategy. To finance acquisitions, developments and debt maturities, as market conditions permit, we may utilize a portion of proceeds from property sales, unsecured debt offerings, term loans, mortgage financings and line of credit borrowings under our $725.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "Unsecured Credit Facility"), and proceeds from the issuance, when and as warranted, of additional equity securities. We also continually evaluate joint venture arrangements as another source of capital to finance acquisitions and developments. As of February 15, 2019, we had approximately $713.4 million available for additional borrowings under the Unsecured Credit Facility.

Future Property Acquisitions, Developments and Property Sales
We have acquisition and development programs through which we seek to identify portfolio and individual industrial property acquisitions and developments. We also sell properties based on market conditions and property related factors. As a result, we are currently engaged in negotiations relating to the possible acquisition, development or sale of certain industrial properties in our portfolio.
When evaluating potential industrial property acquisitions and developments, as well as potential industrial property sales, we will consider such factors as: (i) the geographic area and type of property; (ii) the location, construction quality, condition and design of the property; (iii) the terms of tenant leases, including the potential for rent increases; (iv) the potential for economic growth and the general business, tax and regulatory environment of the area in which the property is located; (v) the occupancy and demand by tenants for properties of a similar type in the vicinity; (vi) competition from existing properties and the potential for the construction of new properties in the area; (vii) the potential for capital appreciation of the property; (viii) the ability to improve the property's performance through renovation; and (ix) the potential for expansion of the physical layout of the property and/or the number of sites.
Industry
Industrial properties are typically used for the design, assembly, packaging, storage and distribution of goods and/or the provision of services. As a result, the demand for industrial space in the United States is related to the level of economic output and consumption, including e-commerce fulfillment. Accordingly, the competition we face to lease our existing properties and acquire or develop new properties varies with the levels of these factors.
