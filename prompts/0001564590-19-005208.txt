Item 1. Business. 
 The Partnership was formed for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds (“MRBs”) that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily and student housing (collectively “Residential Properties”) and commercial properties in their market areas. We expect and believe the interest received on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The Partnership may also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate and may make property loans secured by multifamily residential properties which may or may not be financed by MRBs held by the Partnership, to the extent permitted under the terms of the Partnership’s First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated September 15, 2015, as further amended (the “Amended and Restated LP Agreement”). In addition, the Partnership may acquire interests in multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties.   
 The Partnership’s general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two (“AFCA 2” or “General Partner”).  The general partner of AFCA 2 is Burlington Capital LLC (“Burlington”). The Partnership has issued Beneficial Unit Certificates (“BUCs”) representing assigned limited partner interests to investors (“BUC holders”). The Partnership has issued Series A Preferred Units that represent limited interests in the Partnership under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement. The holders of the BUCs and Series A Preferred Units are referred to herein as “Unitholders.” Unitholders will incur tax liability if any interest earned on the Partnership’s MRBs is determined to be taxable, as well as from the Partnership’s taxable investments. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Report for additional details.  
 The Partnership has been in operation since 1998 and owns 77 MRBs with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $677.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The majority of these MRBs were issued by state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing for 63 Residential Properties containing a total of 10,650 rental units located in 13 states in the United States.  Each MRB for the Residential Properties is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust.  One MRB is secured by a mortgage on the ground, facilities, and equipment of a commercial ancillary health care facility in Tennessee. Each of the MRBs provides for “base” interest payable at a fixed rate on a periodic basis. Additionally, the MRBs may provide for the payment of contingent interest determined by the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties. There were no outstanding MRBs with contingent interest provisions as of December 31, 2018. 
 Of the Partnership’s MRBs, 19 are owned directly by the Partnership. Seven MRBs are owned by ATAX TEBS I, LLC; 12 MRBs are owned by ATAX TEBS II, LLC; 7 MRBs are owned by ATAX TEBS III, LLC; and 25 MRBs are owned by ATAX TEBS IV, LLC. Each of these entities is a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership to facilitate Tax Exempt Bond Securitization (“TEBS”) Financings with Freddie Mac. Two MRBs are securitized and held by Deutsche Bank AG (“DB”) in Term Tender Option Bond (“Term TOB”) facilities. Five MRBs are securitized and held by DB in Term A/B Trust financing facilities. See Notes 2 and 14 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
 The ability of the Residential Properties and the commercial property that collateralize our MRBs to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net cash flow generated by these properties. Net cash flow from a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses. Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located. This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as the requirement that a certain percentage of the rental units be set aside for tenants who qualify as persons of low to moderate income, local or national economic conditions, and the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans. Net cash flow from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment. In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of the properties which collateralize the MRBs. The return we realize from our investments in MRBs depends upon the economic performance of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize these MRBs. We may be in competition with other residential rental properties and commercial properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with our MRBs.
 We may also make taxable property loans secured by the Residential Properties which are financed by MRBs held by us. We do this to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in our best long-term interest.
 We may also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate to the extent allowed by the Amended and Restated LP Agreement. We also rely on an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which has certain restrictions on the types and amounts of securities owned by the Partnership.

Under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, any tax-exempt investments, other than MRBs, that are not secured by a direct or indirect interest in a property must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency.  The Partnership’s acquisition of any tax-exempt investment or other investment may not cause the aggregate book value of such investments to exceed 25% of our assets at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership owned three tax-exempt investments consisting of Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts’ Certificates (“PHC Certificates”). The PHC Certificates had an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $49.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The PHC Certificates consist of beneficial interests in three tender option bond trusts (“PHC Trusts”), which are consolidated variable interest entities of the Partnership. The PHC Certificates held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities. Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) under HUD’s Capital Fund Program established under the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the “Capital Fund Program”). The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities’ respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans. The PHC Certificates are securitized into three separate TOB financing facilities (“TOB Trusts”) with DB.
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned membership interests in nine unconsolidated entities (“Vantage Properties”). Our investments in the Vantage Properties are used to construct multifamily real estate properties. We do not have controlling interests in the Vantage Properties and account for the membership interests under the equity method of accounting.  The Partnership earns a return on its membership interests accruing immediately on its contributed capital, which is guaranteed, to an extent, through the second anniversary of construction completion by an unrelated third party.  The limited membership interests entitle the Partnership to shares of certain cash flows generated by the Vantage Properties from operations and upon the occurrence of certain capital transactions, such as a refinancing or sale.
 We may acquire ownership interests in multifamily, student, and senior citizen apartment properties (“MF Properties”). As of December 31, 2018, we owned two MF Properties containing 859 rental units located in Nebraska and California. In addition, we may acquire real estate securing our MRBs or taxable property loans through foreclosure in the event of a default. Net cash flow of our MF Properties depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses. Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located. This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, and the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans, government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters. We operate our MF Properties until the opportunity arises to sell the properties at what we believe is their optimal fair value or to position ourselves for future investments in MRBs issued to finance these properties.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had four reportable segments: (1) Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, (2) MF Properties, (3) Public Housing Capital Fund Trust, and (4) Other Investments. The Partnership separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.  See Note 23 to the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
 Properties Management. As of December 31, 2018, seven of the 63 Residential Properties which collateralize the MRBs owned by us were managed by Burlington Capital Properties, LLC (“Properties Management”), an affiliate of the Partnership’s general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two (“AFCA 2” or the “General Partner”). In this regard, Properties Management provides property management services for Cross Creek; Greens of Pine Glen (the “Greens Property”); Crescent Village, Willow Bend and Post Woods (collectively, the “Ohio Properties”); Rosewood Townhomes and South Point Apartments. In addition, Properties Management provides services to one of our investments in unconsolidated entities, Vantage at Stone Creek. Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to us and helps assure these properties are being operated in compliance with operating restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable bond financing and/or LIHTC. Property Management also provides management services to The 50/50 MF Property. 
Business Objectives and Strategy
 Our business objectives are acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of MRBs which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, student housing and commercial properties. The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional MRBs and other investments on a leveraged basis.  The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these MRBs is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  The Partnership seeks to achieve its investment growth strategy by investing in additional MRBs and other investments as permitted by the Partnership’s Amended and Restated LP Agreement, taking advantage of financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments. We expect and believe that any contingent interest we receive will be exempt from inclusion in gross income for federal income tax purposes. There were no outstanding MRBs with contingent interest provisions as of December 31, 2018.

We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional MRBs and other investments, as permitted by the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, on a leveraged basis to (i) increase the amount of interest available for distribution to our Unitholders; and (ii) reduce risk through interest rate hedging. We may finance the acquisition of additional MRBs and other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional BUCs or Series A Preferred Units, lines of credit, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of MRBs and other investments. Our current operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage which will not exceed 75% of the total Partnership assets. The assets are defined as the carrying value of the MRBs, PHC Certificates, initial finance costs, and the MF Properties at cost.  See the discussion of financing arrangements and liquidity and capital resources in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 We continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of MRBs. The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our MRB portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our Unitholders. In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected MRBs that have experienced significant appreciation. Through the selective redemption of the MRBs, a sale or refinancing of the underlying property will be required. In other cases, we may elect to sell MRBs on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets. The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other investments consistent with our investment objectives. 
 We expect to invest primarily in MRBs issued to provide affordable rental housing, student housing projects, housing for senior citizens, and commercial property. The four basic types of MRBs which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
  
1. | Private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Bonds issued under Section 145 of the Internal Revenue Code by not-for-profit entities qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Essential function bonds issued by a public instrumentality to finance a multifamily residential property owned by such instrumentality; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Existing “80/20 bonds” that were issued under Section 103(b)(4)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each of these structures permit the issuance of MRBs to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing or other not-for-profit commercial property. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable multifamily residential project financed with MRBs that are purportedly tax-exempt must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area. In each case, the balance of the rental units in the multifamily residential project may be rented at market rates (unless otherwise restricted by local housing authorities). With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the multifamily residential project may elect, at the time the MRBs are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size). The MRBs that were secured by Residential Properties issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called “80/20” bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size. State and local housing authorities may require additional rent restrictions above those required by Treasury Regulations. There are no Treasury Regulations related to the MRBs which are collateralized by the commercial property.
 We expect that many of the private activity housing MRBs that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed multifamily residential project. Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional MRBs, we may also acquire ownership positions in multifamily properties that are held in our MF Properties segment. In many cases, we expect to acquire MRBs on these MF Properties at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property’s ownership. Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
 Additionally, we are also pursuing a business strategy of making equity investments in market-rate multifamily residential properties through noncontrolling membership interests in unconsolidated entities. The Partnership’s investments in unconsolidated entities are used to construct market-rate, multifamily real estate properties. The limited membership interests entitle the Partnership to shares of certain cash flows generated by the Vantage Properties from operations and upon the occurrence of certain capital transactions, such as a refinancing or sale.
 Investment Types
 Mortgage Revenue Bonds. We invest in MRBs that are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on Residential Properties and a commercial property. Each of these bonds bear interest at a fixed annual base rate. The amount of interest earned by us from our investment in MRBs is a function of the net cash flow generated by the Residential Properties and the commercial property which 
 6


collateralize the MRBs. Net cash flow from a residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses. Net cash flow from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients that utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
 Other Securities. We may invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate, as permitted under the terms of the Amended and Restated LP Agreement. Other tax-exempt investments must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency. These tax-exempt investments and other securities may not represent more than 25% of our assets at the time of acquisition.
 PHC Certificates. The PHC Certificates consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to numerous public housing authorities. Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD’s Capital Fund Program. The PHC Certificates have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities’ respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans. The PHC Certificates rating by Standard & Poor’s were investment grade as of December 31, 2018.
 Other Investments. We also have a reportable segment consisting of our ownership of ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, which, as of December 31, 2018, had noncontrolling investments in the Vantage Properties and had issued a property loan to Vantage at Brooks LLC.
Property Loans. We may also make taxable property loans secured by Residential Properties which are financed by MRBs that are held by us.
 MF Properties. We may acquire controlling interests in multifamily, student or senior citizen residential properties. We plan to operate the MF Properties to position ourselves for a future investment in MRBs issued to finance the acquisition and/or rehabilitation of the property by a new owner or until the opportunity arises to sell the properties at what we believe is their optimal fair value.
 Investment Opportunities and Business Challenges
 There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential housing in the United States. HUD reports that there is a high demand for quality affordable housing. The types of MRBs in which we invest offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties. Investors purchase these MRBs because the interest income paid on these bonds is expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.
 The demand for affordable housing by qualified potential residents whose income does not exceed 50-60% of the area median income continues to increase. Government programs that provide direct rental support to residents has not kept up with the demand, therefore programs that support private sector development and support for affordable housing through MRBs, tax credits and grant funding to developers have become more prominent.
 In addition to MRBs, the federal government promotes affordable housing using LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing. The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with MRB financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects. Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing. We do not invest in LIHTCs but are attracted to MRBs that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property. There are various requirements to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions. In general, the property owner must elect to set aside either 40% or more of the property’s residential units for occupancy by households whose income is 60% or less (adjusted for family size) of the area median gross income or 20% or more of the property’s residential units for occupancy by households whose income is 50% or less (adjusted for family size) of the area median gross income. These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
 The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of MRBs or other investments through either additional equity or debt financing. Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term. In addition, the Residential Properties and MF Properties which have not reached stabilization 
 7


(which is 90% occupancy for 90 days and the achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service during the period) will result in lower economic occupancy at the related properties. 
 Since 2016, the Partnership has identified, and owned, membership interests in ten Vantage Properties. These investments in the Vantage Properties are used to construct market-rate, multifamily real estate properties. The limited membership interests entitle the Partnership to shares of certain cash flows generated by the Vantage Properties from operations and upon the occurrence of certain capital transactions, such as a refinancing or sale.
 Financing Arrangements
 The Partnership may finance the acquisition of additional MRBs or other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, use of available lines of credit, with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of MRBs or other investments (including the securitization of these bonds), or through the issuance of Series A Preferred Units or additional BUCs.
 Debt Financing. We utilize leverage to enhance investor rates of return. We use target constraints for each type of financing utilized by us to manage an overall 75% leverage constraint. The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financing collateral. While short term variations from targeted levels may occur within financing classes, overall Partnership leverage will not exceed 75%. Our overall leverage ratio is calculated as total outstanding debt divided by total partnership assets using the carrying value of the MRBs, PHC Certificates, property loans, taxable MRBs, initial finance costs, and the MF Properties at cost. As of December 31, 2018, our leverage ratio was approximately 60%.
 Equity Financing. We may, from time to time, issue additional BUCs in the public market. In November 2016, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (“Registration Statement”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under which the Partnership may offer up to $225.0 million of additional BUCs from time to time. The Registration Statement will expire in November 2019. In December 2017, the Partnership initiated an “at the market offering” and issued 38,617 and 161,383 BUCs for net proceeds of approximately $192,000 and $806,000, net of issuance costs, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The offering was terminated in March 2018. In August 2018, the Partnership initiated a new “at the market offering” to sell up to $75.0 million of BUCs at market prices on the date of sale. The $75 million available under the “at the market program” represented a portion of the $225 million offering of BUCs registered under the Registration Statement. The Partnership sold 310,519 BUCs under the program with proceeds, net of issuance costs, of approximately $1.8 million, during the year ended December 31, 2018. The program was terminated effective February 8, 2019.
 Preferred Equity. Under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, we are authorized to issue partnership securities, including preferred units of limited partnership interests, containing certain designations, preferences, rights, powers, and duties as determined by the General Partner.  As of December 31, 2018, we have issued 9,450,000 Series A Preferred Units for gross proceeds of approximately $94.5 million to five financial institutions. The Series A Preferred Units are redeemable upon the sixth anniversary of the closing of the sale of Series A Preferred Units to a subscriber, and upon each anniversary thereafter, the Partnership and each holder of Series A Preferred Units will have the right to redeem, in whole or in part, the Series A Preferred Units held by such holder at a per unit redemption price equal to $10.00 per unit plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid distributions. The Partnership used the proceeds received to acquire MRBs that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, student housing, and commercial properties that are likely to receive consideration as “qualified investments” under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”).

Management and Employees
 We are managed by our General Partner, which is controlled by its general partner, Burlington Capital LLC (“Burlington”). The Board of Managers and certain employees of Burlington act as the managers (and effectively as the directors) and executive officers of the Partnership. Certain services are provided to us by employees of Burlington and we reimburse Burlington for its allocated share of their salaries and benefits. As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership had no employees.
Competition
 We compete with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and other entities with objectives similar to ours for the acquisition of MRBs and other investments. This competition could reduce the availability of investments to the Partnership for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these investments.
 Because we invest in MRBs secured by Residential Properties, an MRB secured by a commercial property, ownership interests in the MF Properties, and membership interests in unconsolidated entities, we may be in competition with other real estate in the same geographic areas. Multifamily rental properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants. To compete effectively, the multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties financed or owned by us must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates. To maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Residential Properties, MF Properties and properties owned by unconsolidated entities may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period. These Residential Properties, MF Properties and properties owned by unconsolidated entities also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
 Environmental Matters
 We believe each of the MF Properties, the Residential Properties, the commercial property, and properties owned by unconsolidated entities comply, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters. We are not aware of any environmental contamination at any of these properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
Tax Status
 We are classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, there is no provision for income taxes. The distributive share of our income, deductions and credits is included in each Unitholder’s income tax return.
 We held interests in MF Properties, except for the Suites on Paseo and Jade Park, through a wholly-owned subsidiary that is a “C” corporation for income tax purposes. The subsidiary files separate federal and state income tax returns and its income is subject to federal and state income taxes. 
 We consolidate separate legal entities who record, and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies. We do not believe the consolidation of these entities for reporting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) will impact our tax status, amounts reported to Unitholders on Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Schedule K-1, our ability to distribute income to Unitholders which we believe is tax-exempt, the current level of quarterly distributions, or the tax-exempt status of the underlying MRBs.
 All financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, with the exception of the Non-GAAP measure disclosed in Item 7 of this Report. 
 General Information
 The Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership. Our general partner is AFCA 2, whose general partner is Burlington. Since 1984, Burlington has specialized in the management of investment funds, many of which were formed to acquire real estate investments such as MRBs, mortgage-backed securities, and real estate properties, including multifamily, student and senior citizen housing. Burlington maintains its principal executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska 68102, and its telephone number is (402) 444-1630.

The Partnership does not have any employees of its own. Employees of Burlington, acting through AFCA 2 (our General Partner), are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations. AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee equal to 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of any MRBs, tax-exempt investments or other investments for which an unaffiliated party is not obligated to pay. When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all base interest to the Partnership on the MRB on that property. Our Amended and Restated LP Agreement provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by us with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party. In addition, our Amended and Restated LP Agreement provides that we will pay the administrative fee to the General Partner with respect to any foreclosed MRBs.
 AFCA 2 may also earn mortgage placement fees resulting from the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire. Any fees related to the origination of financing facilities are paid by the property owner out of the gross proceeds of the financing. The fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between AFCA 2, its affiliate, and such property owners.
 In addition, an affiliate of AFCA 2, Farnam Capital Advisors, LLC (“FCA”), acted as an origination advisor and consultant to the borrowers when MRBs, other investments and financing facilities were acquired by the Partnership during 2017 and 2016. Any such fees were paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired MRBs or other investments out of their proceeds. 
 Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties. Properties Management earns a fee paid out of property revenues. Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties financed by additional MRBs acquired by the Partnership, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties. If we acquire ownership of any property through foreclosure of an MRB, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and receive a fee payable out of property revenues.
 The Partnership’s initial limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation, which, in general, acts on behalf of the BUCs holders with respect to the exercise and enforcement of the rights of the BUCs holders under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement. BUCs represent assignments by the initial limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner to outside third-party investors. The Series A Preferred Units of the Partnership represent limited partnership interests in the Partnership under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
