ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Overview 
 We are a diversified consumer finance company that provides installment loan products primarily to customers with limited access to consumer credit from banks, thrifts, credit card companies, and other lenders. We operate under the name Regional Finance in 359 branch locations across 11 states in the Southeastern, Southwestern, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwestern United States, serving 401,500 active accounts, as of December 31, 2018. Most of our loan products are secured, and each is structured on a fixed rate, fixed term basis with fully amortizing equal monthly installment payments, repayable at any time without penalty. We source our loans through our multiple channel platform, which includes our branches, centrally-managed direct mail campaigns, digital partners, retailers, and our consumer website. We operate an integrated branch model in which nearly all loans, regardless of origination channel, are serviced through our branch network. This provides us with frequent in-person contact with our customers, which we believe improves our credit performance and customer loyalty. Our goal is to consistently grow our finance receivables and to soundly manage our portfolio risk, while providing our customers with attractive and easy-to-understand loan products that serve their varied financial needs. 
 Our products include small, large, and retail installment loans. Our small loans and large loans are our core loan products and will be the drivers of our future growth. 
 

 | Small Loans  We offer small installment loans with cash proceeds to the customer ranging from $500 to $2,500, with terms of up to 48 months. Our small loans are typically secured by non-essential household goods and/or, to a lesser extent, a lien on a vehicle, which may be an automobile, motorcycle, boat, or all-terrain vehicle. As of December 31, 2018, we had 276,800 small loans outstanding representing $437.7 million in finance receivables, or an average of approximately $1,600 per loan. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, interest and fee income from small loans contributed $156.6 million, $150.1 million, and $142.1 million, respectively, to our total revenue.

 | Large Loans  We offer large installment loans with cash proceeds to the customer generally ranging from $2,501 to $12,000, with terms of between 18 and 60 months. Our large loans are typically secured by non-essential household goods and/or a vehicle. As of December 31, 2018, we had 99,800 large loans outstanding representing $438.0 million in finance receivables, or an average of approximately $4,400 per loan. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, interest and fee income from large loans contributed $111.1 million, $80.3 million, and $55.0 million, respectively, to our total revenue.

 | Retail Loans  We offer indirect retail loans of up to $7,500, with terms of between 6 and 48 months, which are secured by the purchased items. These loans are offered at the point of sale through a network of retailers within and, to a limited extent, outside of our branch footprint. As of December 31, 2018, we had 21,200 retail loans outstanding representing $30.4 million in finance receivables, or an average of approximately $1,400 per loan. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, interest and fee income from retail loans contributed $5.9 million, $5.9 million, and $5.8 million, respectively, to our total revenue.

 | Optional Payment and Collateral Protection Insurance Products  We offer our customers optional payment and collateral protection insurance relating to many of our loan products.

 Through November 2017, we also offered direct and indirect automobile purchase loans of up to $27,500. We ceased originating automobile loans in November 2017, but we continue to own and service the automobile loans that we previously originated. As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,700 automobile loans outstanding representing $26.2 million in finance receivables, or an average of approximately $7,100 per loan. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, interest and fee income from automobile loans contributed $6.4 million, $12.8 million, and $18.1 million, respectively, to our total revenue.

 Our Industry, Customers, and Purpose 
 We operate in the consumer finance industry, in which consumers are generally described as super-prime (most creditworthy), prime, near-prime, non-prime, subprime, or deep-subprime (least creditworthy). Our customers typically have less-than-perfect credit profiles and, for that reason, are generally considered subprime, non-prime, or near-prime consumers. As a result, our customers often do not qualify for prime financing from banks, thrifts, credit card providers, and other lenders. However, like prime consumers, our customers have a need and a desire to utilize credit. 
 Notwithstanding that many lenders are unwilling to serve our customers, we believe that responsible, transparent, and fairly-priced credit products should be made available to our customers. We exist to serve that purpose. Accordingly, we offer our customers access to credit through our affordable, easy-to-understand small loan, large loan, and retail loan products, which we price on fair terms in consideration of the associated credit risk and servicing costs. 
 The average annual percentage rate (APR) of our small loans originated in 2018 was 44.4%. Our large loans, which are reserved for higher credit quality customers who meet more stringent underwriting requirements than those applied to small loan applicants, had an average APR of 30.0% for loans originated in 2018. We believe that the rates on our products are significantly more attractive than many other credit options available to our customers, such as payday, pawn, and title loans, which often come with APRs over 300%. Our loans are also safer and more favorably structured than loans offered by alternative financial service providers. We underwrite our loans based on an applicants ability to repay, whereas payday, pawn, and title loans are typically underwritten based on an ability to collect, either through access to the borrowers bank account or by repossession and sale of collateral. We also structure our loans on a fixed rate, fixed term basis with fully amortizing equal monthly installment payments that are designed to be affordable for our customers and made over an average term of 21 months for small loans and 43 months for large loans (based on loans originated in 2018). By comparison, payday, pawn, and title loans typically have balloon payments following short terms of 14 to 60 days. 
 Importantly, we further differentiate ourselves from alternative financial service providers by reporting our customers payment performance to credit bureaus. This practice provides our customers with the opportunity to improve their credit profile by establishing a responsible payment history with us and, ultimately, to gain access to a wider range of credit options, including our own. For example, in 2018, we worked with many of our deserving customers to refinance nearly 12,000 of our customers small loans into large loans, representing more than $53 million in finance receivables at origination, and resulting in a decrease in these customers average APR from 44.1% to 31.8%. We also believe that over time many of our customers transition away from our company to prime sources of credit. 
 Our diversity of loan products with competitive, safe, and transparent pricing and terms, combined with the opportunity for our customers to improve their credit history and profile, distinguishes us in the consumer finance market, provides us with a competitive advantage, and allows us to serve an important purpose that is mutually beneficial to our customers, communities, employees, and stockholders. 
 Our Business Model 
 Multiple Channel Platform. Our multiple channel platform, which includes our branches, direct mail campaigns, digital partners, retailers, and our consumer website, enables us to offer a range of loan products to new, existing, and former customers throughout our markets. We began building our branch network over 30 years ago and have expanded the network to 359 branches as of December 31, 2018. Our branch personnel market our products in a number of ways, including through a merchant referral program, customer referrals, direct telephone and mail solicitations of current and former customers, and by leveraging our direct mail program. Our direct mail campaigns include pre-screened convenience check mailings and mailings of 
Regional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 3 


  pre-qualified offers and invitations to apply, which enable us to market our products to millions of current and potential customers in a cost-effective manner. We have also developed our consumer website and partnered with digital lead generation sources to promote our products and facilitate loan applications via the internet. Finally, we have relationships with retailers that offer our retail loans in their stores at the point of sale. We believe that our multiple channel platform provides us with a competitive advantage by giving us broad access to our existing and former customers and multiple avenues to attract new customers. 
 Attractive Products for Customers with Limited Access to Credit. Our flexible loan products, generally ranging from $500 to $12,000 with terms of up to 60 months, are competitively priced, easy to understand, and incorporate features designed to meet the varied financial needs and credit profiles of a broad range of consumers. This product diversity distinguishes us from monoline competitors and provides us with the ability to offer our customers new loan products as their credit profiles evolve, building customer loyalty and increasing the overall value of customer relationships. 
 Integrated Branch Model. Our branch network serves as the foundation of our multiple channel platform and the primary point of contact with our customers. Nearly 80% of our loan originations in 2018 occurred in one of our branch locations, and nearly all loans, regardless of origination channel, are serviced through our branches, allowing us to maintain frequent, in-person contact with our customers. By integrating loan origination and loan servicing at the branch level, our employees are able to maintain a relationship with our customers throughout the life of a loan. We believe this frequent-contact, relationship-driven lending model provides greater insight into potential payment difficulties, reduces credit risk, and allows us to assess the borrowing needs of our customers, better enabling us to offer them new loan products as their credit profiles and needs evolve. 
 Consistent Portfolio Performance. Over the past several years, we have sharpened our focus on credit quality by investing in highly-qualified personnel, refining underwriting practices, developing custom credit scorecards, streamlining procedures, automating underwriting decisions, and improving reporting capabilities, all of which allow us to better control the credit quality of our portfolio, maintain compliance with evolving state and federal law, and react quickly whenever market dynamics may change. We have also expanded our centralized collections department and provided our branches with improved collections tools, training, and incentives. As a result of these efforts and practices, between 2015 and 2018, we reported annual net credit loss rates in a relatively narrow band of 8.8% to 9.4% of average finance receivables. 
 Demonstrated Organic Growth. We have grown our total finance receivables by 70.7%, from $546.2 million at December 31, 2014 to $932.2 million at December 31, 2018, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.3%. More importantly, we have grown our core small loan and large loan finance receivables by 139.5%, from $365.7 million at December 31, 2014 to $875.7 million at December 31, 2018, a CAGR of 24.4%. This receivables growth has driven a revenue increase of 49.8%, from $204.7 million in 2014 to $306.7 million in 2018, a CAGR of 10.6%. Our portfolio growth has come from expanding our branch network, growing our finance receivable portfolios within existing branches, and developing new products and channels, including through digital lead generation. From 2014 to 2018, we grew our year-end branch count from 300 branches to 359 branches. We opened a net 17 new branches in 2018, and we have also grown our existing branch revenues. Historically, our branches have rapidly increased their outstanding finance receivables during the early years of operations and generally achieved profitability within one year of opening. 
 Experienced Management Team. Our executive and senior operations management teams consist of individuals experienced in installment lending and other consumer finance services. Both our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer have nearly 30 years of experience in consumer financial services, and our Chief Risk Officer has over 20 years of financial and consumer lending experience, including expertise in credit risk management. As of December 31, 2018, our state operations vice presidents averaged nearly 28 years of industry experience and more than 8 years of service at Regional, while our district supervisors averaged nearly 21 years of industry experience and more than 6 years of service with Regional. Our executive and senior operations management team members intend to leverage their experience and expertise in consumer lending to grow our business, deliver high-quality service to our customers, and carefully manage our credit risk.

 Our Strategies 
 Grow Our Branch Network. We intend to continue to grow the receivables, revenue, and profitability of our existing branches, to open new branches within our existing geographic footprint, and to expand our operations into new states. Establishing local contact with our customers through our branch network is key to our frequent-contact, relationship-driven lending model. We believe that there remains substantial opportunity to grow the finance receivable portfolios of our existing branches by continuing our focus on large loan originations and by cross-selling new loan products to our existing customers, including those customers with retail loans and automobile loans. In addition, from 2014 to 2018, we opened or acquired a net 59 new branches, and in 2018, we opened our first branches in Missouri and Wisconsin. We expect that as our newer branches mature, their revenue will grow faster than our overall same-store revenue growth rate. We believe there is sufficient demand for consumer finance services to continue new branch openings in certain of the states where we currently operate, allowing us to capitalize on our existing infrastructure and experience in these markets. We also intend to explore opportunities for growth in several states outside of our existing geographic footprint that enjoy favorable operating environments. Our competitors operate in as many as 44 states. 
 Leverage Our Direct Mail Capabilities. Direct mail campaigns are launched throughout the year, but are weighted to coincide with seasonal consumer demand. In addition, we mail convenience checks in new markets as soon as new branches are open, which develops a customer base and builds finance receivables for these new branches. In 2018, we mailed 6.6 million convenience checks, 1.4 million pre-qualified loan offers, and 2.2 million invitations to apply. Moving forward, we plan to continue to invest in and to improve the targeting criteria, offer strategies, and testing protocols of our direct mail campaigns, which we believe will enable us to efficiently grow our receivables with improved credit performance. We expect that these efforts will allow us to increase volume at our branches by adding new customers, recapturing former customers, and creating opportunities to offer new loan products to our existing customers. 
 Expand Our Digital Presence. In order to better serve and attract customers who prefer to conduct business digitally, we make an online loan application available on our consumer website, generate customer leads through digital partners, and provide our customers with online account management capabilities. Throughout 2018, we continued to grow our digital acquisition channel, more than tripling our investment from 2017 to 2018. This investment enabled us to increase our digitally-sourced loan originations by nearly 130% year-over-year and to grow the percentage of new customers generated through this channel to more than 15% of all new small and large loan customers in 2018. We also continued to enhance and promote our online account management tools that enable customers to make payments and manage their accounts online. In 2019, we expect to continue to invest in the digital channel, thereby adding capabilities, improving efficiencies, enhancing the customer experience, and testing new mechanisms for lead generation to further diversify and expand our new business acquisition mechanisms. 
 Maintain Sound Underwriting and Credit Control. Since 2015, we have invested heavily in our credit and collections functions. We plan to continue to do so in the future by maintaining highly-qualified employees dedicated to managing credit risk, refining our underwriting models, and improving our collection efforts, through both our branch operations and our centralized collections department. In early 2018, we completed the implementation of our new loan origination and servicing software platform, which allows us to automate our underwriting decisions, among other benefits. In addition, in the second half of 2018, we began to integrate custom credit models into our automated underwriting processes. We expect to complete the rollout of our custom credit models to all of our states in 2019, with the benefit of such models expected to begin impacting our results in late 2019 and 2020. Through these efforts and others, we plan to continue to carefully manage our credit exposure as we grow our business, offer new products, and enter new markets. 
 Carefully Manage Our G&A Expenses. We have made significant investments in our business over the past several years, including by increasing our marketing spend to drive new business, expanding our branch network, hiring operations employees to service our growing finance receivable portfolio, and improving our 
Regional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 5 


  credit and information technology capabilities. However, during that time, we also remained keenly focused on driving operating leverage through the prudent management of our expenses. Between 2015 and 2018, our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of average finance receivables decreased from 20.2% to 16.4%. As we grow our business, we will remain vigilant in our management of general and administrative expenses, with the goal of causing such expenses to decrease as a percentage of average finance receivables over time. 
Our Loan Products 
 We offer small, large, and retail installment loans to our customers. Our underwriting standards focus on our customers ability to affordably make loan payments out of their discretionary income, with the value of pledged collateral serving as a credit enhancement rather than the primary underwriting criterion. The interest rates, fees and other charges, maximum principal amounts, and maturities for our loans vary from state to state, depending on the competitive environment and relevant laws and regulations. 
 Small loans and large loans are closed in our branch network or originated through our convenience check direct mail campaigns. Our convenience check direct mail loan offers enable prospective customers to enter into a loan with us by cashing or depositing the check attached to the loan offer, thereby agreeing to the terms of the loan as prominently set forth on the check and accompanying disclosures. When a customer enters into a loan by cashing or depositing the convenience check, our personnel gather additional information on the borrower to assist in servicing the loan. Our retail loans are indirect installment loans structured as retail installment sales contracts. Retail loans are made through a retailer at the point of sale without the need for the customer to visit one of our branches. Our customers use our retail loans to finance the purchase of furniture, appliances, and other retail products. The vast majority of our retail loans are originated inside of our eleven-state brick-and-mortar footprint, but on a limited basis, we offer retail loans in states outside of our footprint. The servicing of nearly all retail loans is performed within our branches, with only out-of-footprint retail loans being serviced centrally from our headquarters in South Carolina. 
 For loans originated in our branch network, we consider numerous factors in evaluating a potential customers creditworthiness, such as unencumbered income, debt-to-income ratios, length of current employment, duration of residence, and a credit report detailing the applicants credit history. Our loan origination and servicing software platform guides our branch personnel through the credit application process and automates much of the underwriting, with underwriting exceptions generally subject to review and approval by a senior operations or centralized underwriting team member. For retail loans, our retail partners typically submit credit applications to us online while the customer waits in the retailers store. Underwriting for our retail loans is conducted by our centralized underwriting team using standards substantially similar to our branch small loan and large loan underwriting guidelines. Our retail loan credit decisions generally are provided to the retailer within ten minutes of our receipt of the application. For convenience check loans, each prospect that we solicit has been pre-screened through a major credit bureau against our underwriting criteria, which includes an evaluation of the recipients credit score, bankruptcy history, and a number of additional credit attributes relevant to the recipients likely ability and willingness to repay the offered convenience check loan. 
 Loan renewals are also an important part of our business. Our customers use renewals to extend and expand their lending relationships with us. We generally offer loan renewals to existing customers who have demonstrated an ability and willingness to repay amounts owed to us. Renewals typically refinance one or more of a customers loans into a single new loan, which in some cases will be for a larger principal balance than the customers original loan, though we permit renewals of existing loans at or below the original loan amount. In evaluating a loan for renewal, in addition to our standard underwriting requirements, we are able to take into consideration the customers prior payment performance with us, which we believe is a very strong indicator of the customers future credit performance. In 2018, renewals of loans in an amount greater than the original loan amount represented 47% of our loan originations and renewals of loans at or below the original loan amount represented 19% of our loan originations.

Our Insurance and Ancillary Products 
 We also offer our customers various optional payment and collateral protection insurance products as a complement to our lending operations. Our primary insurance products include optional credit life insurance, accident and health insurance, involuntary unemployment insurance, and personal property insurance. These insurance products are optional and not a condition of the loan, and we do not sell insurance to non-borrowers. Our insurance products, including the types of products offered and their terms and conditions, vary from state to state in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Insurance policy premiums, claims, and expenses are included in the companys results of operations as insurance income, net in the consolidated statements of income. In 2018, insurance income, net was $14.8 million, or 4.8% of our total revenue. 
 Credit life insurance provides for the payment in full of the borrowers credit obligation to the lender in the event of the borrowers death and, in some states, may provide a payment to a secondary beneficiary listed by the 
 
Regional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 8 


  borrower. Credit accident and health insurance provides for the repayment of certain loan installments to the lender that come due during an insureds period of income interruption resulting from disability from illness or injury. Credit involuntary unemployment insurance provides for repayment of certain loan installments in the event that the borrower is no longer employed as the result of a qualifying event, such as a layoff or reduction in workforce. Credit personal property insurance provides for payment following accidental loss of or damage to personal property collateral resulting from certain casualty events. We require that customers maintain property insurance on any personal property securing loans and offer customers the option of providing proof of such insurance purchased from a third party (such as homeowners or renters insurance) in lieu of purchasing property insurance from us. We also require proof of insurance on any vehicles securing loans, and in select markets, we offer vehicle single interest insurance on vehicles used as collateral on small and large loans. 
 All customers purchasing these types of insurance from us are required to sign multiple statements affirming that they understand that their purchase of insurance is optional and not a condition of the loan. In addition, a customer may cancel purchased insurance at any time during the life of the loan, including in connection with an early payoff or loan refinancing. Customers who cancel within thirty (30) days of the date of purchase receive a full refund of the insurance premium, and customers who cancel thereafter receive a refund of the unearned portion of the insurance premium. 
 Apart from the various optional payment and collateral protection insurance products that we offer to our customers, on certain loans, we also collect a fee from our customers and, in turn, purchase non-file insurance from an unaffiliated insurance company for our benefit in lieu of recording and perfecting our security interest in personal property collateral. Non-file insurance protects us from credit losses where, following an event of default, we are unable to take possession of personal property collateral because our security interest is not perfected (for example, in certain instances where a customer files for bankruptcy). In such circumstances, non-file insurance generally will pay to us an amount equal to the lesser of the loan balance or the collateral value, with such claims payment lowering our net credit losses. 
 We market and sell insurance policies as an agent of an unaffiliated insurance company, within the limitations established by our agency contracts with the unaffiliated insurance company. We then remit to the unaffiliated insurance company the premiums we collect, net of refunds on prepaid loans and net of commission on new business. The unaffiliated insurance company then cedes to our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd., the net insurance premium revenue and the associated insurance claims liability for all insurance products, including the non-file insurance that we purchase. Life insurance premiums are ceded as written, and non-life insurance premiums are ceded as earned. In accepting the premium revenue and associated claims liability, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd. acts as reinsurer for all insurance products that we sell to our customers and for the non-file insurance that we purchase. RMC Reinsurance, Ltd. pays the unaffiliated insurance company a ceding fee for the continued administration of all insurance products. 
 In addition, in select states, we offer an Auto Plus Plan auto club product that is administered and serviced through a third-party provider. The product generally provides certain automobile, home, travel, and other services and benefits to customers, including emergency towing and roadside assistance, emergency locksmith service, automobile repair reimbursement, stolen car expense benefit, automobile insurance deductible reimbursement, limited legal services, and various travel and other discounts. As with the optional insurance products that we offer, any customer purchasing an Auto Plus Plan acknowledges that the purchase is optional and not a condition of the loan and that the plan may be cancelled within 30 days for a full refund.

 Our Branches 
 Our branches are generally located in visible, high-traffic locations, such as shopping centers. We believe that our branches have an open, welcoming, and hospitable layout. In evaluating whether to locate a branch in a particular community, we examine several factors, including the demographic profile of the community, demonstrated demand for consumer finance, the regulatory and political climate, and the availability of suitable employees to staff, manage, and supervise the new branch. 
 The following table sets forth the number of branches as of the dates indicated:

 The following table sets forth the average finance receivables per branch based on maturity, excluding acquired branches:

Branches open three to five years | $ | 2,623 | | 21.5 | % | 56 
Branches open five years or more | $ | 2,792 | | 6.4 | % | 253

 The average contribution to operating income from our branches has historically increased as our branches mature. The following table sets forth the average operating income contribution per branch for the year ended December 31, 2018, based on maturity of the branch, excluding acquired branches. 
 

Age of Branch (As of December 31, 2018) | Average BranchOperating Income (Loss)Contribution | | | Percentage IncreaseFrom Prior AgeCategory | | Number ofBranches

Branches open three to five years | $ | 309 | | | 125.5 | % | 56 
Branches open five years or more | $ | 407 | | | 31.7 | % | 253

 We calculate the average branch contribution as total revenues generated by the branch less the expenses directly attributable to the branch, including the provision for losses and operating expenses, such as personnel, lease, and interest expenses. General corporate overhead, including management salaries, is not attributed to any 
 
Regional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 10 


  individual branch. Accordingly, the sum of branch contributions from all of our branches is greater than our income before taxes. 
 Employees and Training 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,535 employees. New employees must complete a comprehensive training curriculum that focuses on the company- and position-specific competencies needed to be successful. The training includes a blended approach utilizing eLearning modules, hands-on exercises, webinars, and assessments. Training content is focused on our operating policies and procedures, as well as several key compliance areas. Incentive compensation for new employees is contingent upon the successful and timely completion of the required new hire training curriculum. All current employees are also required to complete annual compliance training and re-certification. Additional management and developmental training is provided for those employees seeking to advance within our company. 
Payment and Loan Servicing 
 We have implemented company-wide payment and loan servicing policies and procedures, which are designed to maintain consistent portfolio performance and to ensure regulatory compliance. Our district supervisors, state vice presidents, and compliance and internal audit teams regularly review servicing and collection records to ensure compliance with our policies and procedures. Our centralized management information system enables regular monitoring of branch portfolio metrics by management, and the compensation opportunities of our operations employees and senior management have a significant performance component that is closely tied to credit quality, among other defined performance targets. 
 The responsibility for the servicing and collection of each loan generally rests with the originating branch. Borrowers who have signed up for online account access have on-demand access to their account information through Regionals website. In addition, borrowers may elect to receive automated, one-way text messages with information regarding their account, including payment reminders. Borrowers have the option of making payments (i) in person at a branch where they may pay by cash, check, money order, debit card, or immediate, one-time future, or recurring ACH, (ii) through our customer portal via debit card or immediate, one-time future, or recurring ACH, or (iii) by immediate or one-time future debit card or ACH over the phone. In the fourth quarter of 2018, more than half of customer payments were made by debit card or ACH. 
 If a loan becomes severely delinquent, a branch may receive co-collection assistance from our centralized servicing facility. Our philosophy is to work with customers experiencing payment difficulties. If a customer is unable to make the required payments to bring his or her loan current, acceptable solutions to remedy a past due loan may include deferment of a payment, loan renewal, or settlement. All solutions are intended to enable the customer to meet his or her current and future obligations in a manner that we believe will mitigate our risk, while also complying with state and federal laws and regulations, as well as our policies and procedures. 
 Customers are limited to two deferrals in a rolling twelve-month period unless it is determined that an exception is warranted (e.g. following a natural disaster). We generally limit the refinancing of delinquent loans to those customers who have made recent payments and for whom we have verified current employment, and we do not charge any origination fees on the refinancing of a delinquent loan. We believe that refinancing delinquent loans for certain deserving customers who have made periodic payments allows us to help customers resolve temporary financial setbacks and repair or sustain their credit. During 2018, we refinanced approximately $26.5 million of loans that were 60 or more days contractually past due, representing approximately 2.5% of our total loan originations in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance of such refinanced loans was $33.8 million, or 3.6% of finance receivables as of such date. We may also agree to settle a past due loan by accepting less than the full principal balance owed. A settlement is only used in certain limited cases and is only offered once we have determined that we are unlikely to collect the entire outstanding balance of the loan. 
 For seriously delinquent accounts, we may seek legal judgments or pursue repossession of collateral. We typically initiate repossession efforts only when we have exhausted other means of collection and, in the opinion 
 
Regional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 11 


  of management, the customer is unlikely to make further payments. We sell substantially all repossessed collateral through sales conducted by independent auction organizations, after the required post-repossession waiting period. Generally, we charge off loans during the month that the loan becomes 180 days contractually delinquent. Non-titled accounts in a confirmed Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy are charged off at 60 days contractually delinquent, subject to certain exceptions. Deceased borrower accounts are charged off in the month following the proper notification of passing, with the exception of borrowers with credit life insurance. We sell most of our charged-off accounts to third-party debt buyers. 
Information Technology 
 In 2016, we entered into an agreement with Nortridge Software, LLC (Nortridge) to transition to the Nortridge loan origination and servicing platform. From January 2016 to February 2018, we conducted a state-by-state phased implementation of the Nortridge platform in each of our states of operation. As of February 2018, all of our branches operate using the Nortridge platform. Prior to our use of Nortridge, we serviced our loan portfolio using a software package developed and owned by ParaData Financial Systems. 
 We utilize the Nortridge platform both to originate loans and to service our loan portfolio, and we have invested in customizing the Nortridge platform to meet our needs based upon our specific products, processes, and reporting requirements. The Nortridge custom decision engine utilizes application information and a credit report detailing the applicants credit history to generate an initial credit decision and to guide our branch employees through the loan origination process to the final credit decision. Throughout the life of the loan, our employees utilize Nortridge to, among other things, enter payments, generate collection queues, and log collection activity. Nortridge also facilitates electronic and recurring payments, automated text messaging, and customer account access through a customer portal. Nortridge logs and maintains, within our centralized information systems, a permanent record of the loan origination and servicing approvals and processes, and permits all levels of branch and centralized management to review the individual and collective performance of all branches for which they are responsible on a daily basis. 
 We intend to continue to enhance the Nortridge platform to further leverage its capabilities and to meet our evolving needs. In addition, we rely on Teledata Communications Inc. and other third-party software vendors to provide access to credit applications. 
 Competition 
 The consumer finance industry is highly fragmented, with numerous competitors. The competition we face for each of our loan products is distinct. 
 Small and Large Loans. We compete with several national companies operating greater than 800 branch locations each, as well as a handful of smaller, regionally-focused companies with between 100 and 300 branches in certain of the states in which we operate. We believe that the majority of our competitors are independent operators with generally less than 100 branches. We believe that competition between installment consumer loan companies occurs primarily on the basis of price, breadth of loan product offerings, flexibility of loan terms offered, and the quality of customer service provided. While underbanked customers may also use alternative financial services providers, such as title lenders, payday lenders, and pawn shops, their products offer different terms and typically carry substantially higher interest rates and fees than our installment loans. Accordingly, we believe that alternative financial services providers are not an attractive option for customers who meet our underwriting standards, which are generally stricter than the underwriting standards of alternative financial services providers. Our small and large loans also compete with pure online lenders, peer-to-peer lenders, and issuers of non-prime credit cards. 
 Retail Loans. In recent years, the retail loan industry has seen an increasing number of lenders enter the market that are dedicated to originating non-prime retail loans. We also face competition from rent-to-own
Regional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 12 


  financing, leasing, and credit card companies. Our retail loans are typically made at competitive rates, and competition is largely on the basis of interest rates charged, the quality of credit accepted, the flexibility of loan terms offered, the speed of approval, and the quality of customer service provided. Point-of-sale financing decisions must be made rapidly while the customer is on the sales floor. We endeavor to provide responses to customers in less than ten minutes, and we staff our centralized retail loan underwriting team with multiple shifts seven days per week during peak retail shopping hours to ensure rapid response times. 
Seasonality 
 Our loan volume and contractual delinquency follow seasonal trends. Demand for our small and large loans is typically highest during the second, third, and fourth quarters, which we believe is largely due to customers borrowing money for vacation, back-to-school, and holiday spending. With the exception of retail loans, loan demand has generally been the lowest during the first quarter, which we believe is largely due to the timing of income tax refunds. Delinquencies generally reach their lowest point in the first quarter of the year and rise throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Consequently, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our operating results and cash needs. 
Government Regulation 
 Consumer finance companies are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal, state, and local statutes, regulations, and ordinances. Many of these laws impose detailed constraints on the terms of our loans and the retail installment sales contracts that we purchase, the lending forms that we utilize, and our operations. The software that we use to originate loans is designed in part to aid in compliance with all applicable lending laws and regulations. 
 State Lending Regulation. We are regulated by state agencies that regularly audit our branches and operations. In general, state statutes establish maximum loan amounts and interest rates, as well as the types and maximum amounts of fees and insurance premiums that we may charge for both direct and indirect lending. Specific allowable charges vary by state. In addition, state laws regulate the keeping of books and records and other aspects of the operation of consumer finance companies, and state and federal laws regulate account collection practices. State agency approval is required to open new branches, and each of our branches is separately licensed under the laws of the state in which the branch is located. Licenses granted by the regulatory agencies in these states are subject to renewal every year and may be revoked for failure to comply with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. In the states in which we currently operate, licenses may be revoked only after an administrative hearing. We believe we are in compliance with state laws and regulations applicable to our lending operations in each state. 
 State Insurance Regulation. Premiums and charges for optional payment and collateral protection insurance products are set at or below authorized statutory rates and are stated separately in our disclosures to customers, as required by the federal Truth in Lending Act and by various applicable state laws. We are also subject to state laws and regulations governing insurance agents in the states in which we sell insurance. State insurance regulations require that insurance agents be licensed and limit the premium amount charged for such insurance. Our captive insurance subsidiary is regulated by the insurance authorities of the Turks and Caicos Islands of the British West Indies, where the subsidiary is organized and domiciled. 
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act). At the federal level, Congress enacted comprehensive financial regulatory reform legislation in 2010. A significant focus of the law, known as the Dodd-Frank Act, is heightened consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), which has regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of non-depository lenders and to promulgate rules that can affect the practices and activities of lenders. 
Regional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 13 


 The Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder may affect our operations through increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB and the imposition of restrictions on the terms of certain loans. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the protections established in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB the authority to examine and regulate large non-depository financial companies and gives the CFPB authority over anyone deemed by rule to be a larger participant of a market for other consumer financial products or services. The CFPB contemplates regulating the installment lending industry as part of the consumer credit and related activities market. However, this so-called larger participant rule will not impose substantive consumer protection requirements, but rather will provide to the CFPB the authority to supervise larger participants in certain markets, including by requiring reports and conducting examinations to ensure, among other things, that they are complying with existing federal consumer financial law. While the CFPB has defined a larger participant standard for certain markets, such as the debt collection, automobile finance, and consumer reporting markets, it has not yet acted to define larger participant in the traditional installment lending market. If, in the future, a traditional installment lending larger participant rule is promulgated by the CFPB, the rule would likely cover only the largest installment lenders, and we do not yet know whether the definition of larger participant would cover us. 
 In addition to the grant of certain regulatory powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations thereunder, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. 
 Other Federal Laws and Regulations. In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act and state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances, numerous other federal laws and regulations affect our lending operations. These laws include the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and in each case the regulations thereunder, and the Federal Trade Commissions Credit Practices Rule. These laws require us to provide complete disclosure of the principal terms of each loan to the borrower prior to the consummation of the loan transaction, prohibit misleading advertising, protect against discriminatory lending practices, govern the manner in which we report customer information to consumer reporting agencies, govern the terms of loans to servicemembers, and proscribe unfair credit practices. 
 

 | Truth in Lending Act. Under the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, we must disclose certain material terms related to a credit transaction, including, but not limited to, the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, the number and amount of payments, and payment due dates to repay the indebtedness.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder, we cannot discriminate against any credit applicant on the basis of any protected category, such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. We are also required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise customers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for the rejection.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Fair Credit Reporting Act. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, we must provide certain information to customers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a report obtained from a consumer reporting agency, promptly update any credit information reported to a credit reporting agency about a customer, and have a process by which customers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is designed to ease legal and financial burdens on military personnel and their families during active duty status. We may be
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regional Management Corp. | 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K | 14 


 
required to reduce interest rates on pre-service debts incurred by servicemembers, and we may be prohibited from pursuing certain forms of legal action against servicemembers, such as default judgments, during periods of active duty.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Military Lending Act. The Military Lending Act applies to active-duty servicemembers and their covered dependents. We are prohibited from charging a borrower covered under the Military Lending Act more than a 36% Military Annual Percentage Rate, which includes certain costs associated with the loan in calculating the interest rate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, we must protect the confidentiality of our customers non-public personal information and disclose information on our privacy policy and practices, including with regard to the sharing of customers non-public personal information with third parties. This disclosure must be made to customers at the time the customer relationship is established and, in some cases, at least annually thereafter.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Credit Practices Rule. The Federal Trade Commissions Credit Practices Rule limits the types of property we may accept as collateral to secure a consumer loan.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Violations of these statutes and regulations may result in actions for damages, claims for refund of payments made, certain fines and penalties, injunctions against certain practices, and the potential forfeiture of rights to repayment of loans. For a discussion regarding how risks and uncertainties associated with the current regulatory environment may impact our future expenses, net income, and overall financial condition, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.
