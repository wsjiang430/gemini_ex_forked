Our Purpose and Values
 
Our purpose is: “We build meaningful connections to help businesses run smarter.”  We live by our core values of Hunger, Heart and Harmony, which set the tone for our business and define who we are.  Our core values are:
Hunger – Our insatiable desire to create new opportunities for our clients and our business is apparent in everything we do.
 
Heart – We seek to impact the lives of the people we serve positively by always putting our clients, partners and teammates first.
 
Harmony – We invite perspective, and we consistently celebrate each other’s unique contributions as we work together to bring the best solutions to our clients.
 We believe that these values strengthen the overall Insight experience for our clients, partners and teammates (we refer to our customers as “clients,” our suppliers as “partners” and our employees as “teammates”).    
Our Market
 The worldwide total addressable market for information technology is forecasted to be $3.8 trillion annually according to Gartner, a leading IT research and advisory company.  Based on our analysis of Gartner market data, we believe the top 10 most comparable global solution providers represent less than 10% of the worldwide total addressable market.  We believe our addressable worldwide market in the indirect sales IT channel represents approximately $652 billion in annual sales and for the year ended December 31, 2018, our net sales of $7.1 billion represented approximately 1% of that highly diverse market.  We believe that we are well positioned in this highly fragmented global market with locations in 19 countries and our deep experience delivering IT hardware, software and services solutions across the globe.  
Our Value Proposition
 
As the IT industry evolves, our value proposition to our clients continues to evolve.  The increased complexity across the technology ecosystem, combined with the continual emergence of new trends and offerings, has made it difficult for most clients to effectively manage their IT environments.  We consult with our clients regarding their IT product and services needs and help our clients define, architect, implement and manage their IT solutions.
 We believe that Insight has a unique position in the market to gain profitable market share by offering Intelligent Technology SolutionsTM that empower our clients to manage their IT environments so they can drive meaningful business outcomes today and transform their operations for tomorrow.
 
Insight’s unique advantages include:
  
• | Our global scale and coverage – we have the capabilities to serve clients across the globe with hardware, software provisioning and related services and with integrated technology solutions in multiple countries directly or through our partner network.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our operational excellence and systems – we offer a broad selection of products with access to billions of dollars in virtual inventory and efficient supply chain execution, as well as product fulfillment, logistics capabilities, management tools and technical expertise.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our software DNA – we understand complex licensing requirements and have the know-how to optimize our clients’ usage and compliance management through a portfolio of license consulting and optimization services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our partner alignment – we have a multi-partner approach and have deep relationships with leading product manufacturers, software publishers and distribution partners, as well as emerging cloud and other technology partners, to service our global portfolio of commercial and public sector clients with the integrated IT solutions that make the most sense for their IT environments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Our data center transformation skills – in support of our long-term strategy, we acquired Datalink (2017 U.S.) and Caase (2017 Netherlands) providers of IT services, cloud and enterprise data center solutions, adding additional deep technical expertise and complementary services offerings to our internally developed solutions and increasing our addressable market opportunity in hybrid cloud and other high-growth data center categories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our next-generation tech skills – we quickly adapt to new technology trends and innovation, investing internally to advance our technical capabilities while at the same time making strategic acquisitions that establish us as thought leaders, with scale and reach, around emerging market trends. The Blue Metal (2015, U.S.), Ignia (2016, Australia) and Cardinal (2018, U.S.) acquisitions are examples of acquisitions that have given us global capabilities to support our clients as they look to accelerate in the digital world.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our App development and Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) expertise – we were recognized as Microsoft’s Worldwide Partner of the Year for IoT as well as Mobile App Development in each of the past two years and, combined with our hardware and software expertise, we are well-positioned to deliver holistic connected product and IoT solutions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our services solutions – we can scale to help organizations of all sizes and have well-developed services capabilities focused on four solutions areas: supply chain optimization, connected workforce, cloud and data center transformation and digital innovation, that represent the ways we help our clients with the demands they face, as discussed in more detail below.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our track record for successfully integrating mergers and acquisitions to accelerate growth – we have a demonstrated track record for acquiring strategic businesses and integrating them into the Insight model, while effectively realizing the benefits of the combined businesses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Strategy
 
A client’s information technology service needs span an array of business priorities including modern infrastructure and cloud options, workforce productivity initiatives, and leveraging IT to differentiate with their customers.  We believe our four solution areas effectively represent the areas that our clients care about most and were designed to allow our clients, and the different decision makers within our clients, to interact with us in multiple ways, whether acquiring a hardware or software asset, implementing public cloud or as-a-service workplace solutions, designing a next generation or hybrid cloud data center, or leveraging sophisticated IOT and artificial intelligence solutions to improve their clients’ experience.  At each connection point, we provide technical expertise and advisory services to our clients.

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
 
Our go to market framework for our four solution areas, built on thirty years of broad IT experience combined with strategic acquisitions, new services development and deep partner relationships, uniquely positions us to help our clients manage their business today and also transform to meet their needs tomorrow.  Our expertise is deep across these key solutions areas:

Supply Chain Optimization – Through Insight’s core business, we help clients effectively and efficiently acquire all of their information technology needs leveraging our scale and supply chain expertise. We help our clients invest smarter.
Connected Workforce – We help clients deliver a secure, modern experience to their workforce, driving productivity in the workplace and helping to attract and retain talent in this competitive marketplace. We help our clients work smarter.
Cloud and Data Center Transformation – We help clients optimize, modernize and secure their data center infrastructure and leverage cloud to improve business agility. We help our clients run workloads smarter. 
Digital Innovation – We leverage innovative applications and emerging technologies to improve clients’ business performance, engage customers and uncover new revenue streams. We help our clients innovate smarter. 

Each of our solution areas represents a discrete area of growth for our business and when connected to each other, they provide a platform for our clients to leverage our breadth of expertise to solve their most relevant business challenges from IT supply chain to optimizing performance in the digital world.  Our strategy is to increase our penetration with new and existing clients within the four focus solution areas across our geographic footprint in North America, EMEA and APAC. Our offerings within the solution areas include hardware and software products from market leading and emerging manufacturer brands, sold separately or combined into branded solutions with Insight delivered professional or managed services.  We can serve clients directly in each of our markets or serve a single client globally where they can enjoy a common experience across our footprint.  To execute our strategy, we employ centralized and field-based sales, engineering and services resources to connect with our clients.  We also have invested in approximately 1,000 technical engineers, architects and software developers who create and deliver integrated IT solutions to our clients globally, an asset that we believe differentiates us in the marketplace.  
 
Our unique solution area go to market strategy is supported by a strong operational platform that includes scalable IT and e-commerce systems and processes, robust digital marketing capabilities and a culture of continuous business process transformation and automation.  
 
E-commerce and Cloud Management Systems - In recent years, cloud and as-a-service solutions have become more mainstream and adoption continues to increase across markets and verticals.  Key market imperatives in the adoption of these solutions are speed to market, flexibility, scalability and availability.  We have invested in, and will continue to invest in, technical tools and resources to provide clients with the assessment, migration, integration and managed services required to simplify the cloud adoption decision, whether that decision results in a private, public or hybrid cloud environment.

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
 
We also continue to invest in our global e-commerce platform, which serves as a single marketplace for our clients to buy and manage anything from a discrete product offering to their cloud and other as-a-service subscriptions.  Components of our e-commerce platform include:

• | Customizable client portals, primarily in North America, which allow clients to streamline procurement and processes through a self-service online tool, drive standardization and optimize reconciliation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A focus on small to medium-sized clients, providing them with the ability to learn, solve, buy, and manage cloud products and services via our online experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A similar online experience and capabilities for our larger enterprise clients with added IT as a Service Broker capabilities allowing larger IT organizations to centrally provide cloud offerings while maintaining the manageability and visibility they require.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital Marketing Enablement – We have invested in internal industry and marketing expertise to develop original go to market and IT solution content, whitepapers and industry research studies to ensure we enable our clients with relevant information around IT and business trends.  Further, we leverage a best-in-class digital marketing technology stack to personalize the delivery of our content through an omni-channel experience as they manage and transform their IT investment. Our integrated suite of digital marketing tools has allowed us to access and grow our position in the mid-market over the past few years while also strengthening our marketing alignment with our partners.
Culture of Business Transformation and Automation – At the heart of our culture is an intense desire to improve our clients’ experience when doing business with us either on the web, through business to business connections or on the telephone.  We have a dedicated business transformation team focused on end to end process improvement initiatives around order flow, dynamic pricing and cost optimization, and back office operations, all oriented to the impact on client experience.  In 2018, we began to invest in process automation and optical recognition scanning solutions to improve certain of our client facing processes, making the buying experience more frictionless while improving the scalability of our business processes for the long term.
Our Offerings
 Our offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include a suite of IT hardware, software and services solutions.  Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments are largely software and certain software-related services.  On a consolidated basis, hardware, software and services represented approximately 61%, 27% and 12%, respectively, of our net sales in 2018.  This compares to 58%, 32% and 10%, respectively, of our net sales in 2017 and 54%, 37% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales in 2016.  Additional detailed sales mix information by operating segment can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

 Hardware Product Offerings
We offer products from hundreds of manufacturers, including such industry leaders as Cisco, Dell/EMC, HP Inc., Lenovo, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“HPE”), NetApp, Apple, Microsoft and IBM.  Our scale and purchasing power, combined with our efficient, high-volume and cost effective direct sales and marketing model, allow us to offer competitive prices.  We believe that offering choices from multiple partners enables us to better serve our clients by providing a variety of product solutions to address their specific business needs.
 In addition to our distribution facilities, we have “direct-ship” programs with many of our partners, including manufacturers and distributors, allowing us to expand our product offerings without increasing inventory, handling costs or inventory warehousing risk exposure.  As a result, we are able to offer billions of dollars of products in virtual inventory in fulfilling our performance obligations to our clients.  Convenience and product options among multiple brands are key competitive advantages compared to manufacturers’ direct selling programs, which are generally limited to their own brands and may not offer clients a complete or best-in-class solution across all product categories.
 Software Product Offerings
 
Our clients acquire software applications from us in the form of licensing agreements with software publishers or boxed products.  We offer products from hundreds of publishers, including such industry leaders as Microsoft, VMware, Adobe, IBM Software, Symantec and Citrix.  
 As software publishers choose different models for implementing licensing agreements, businesses must evaluate the alternatives to ensure that they select the appropriate agreements and comply with the publishers’ licensing terms when purchasing and managing their software licenses.  With many publishers now offering public cloud-based software solutions in place of licenses consumed on premise, we expect we will continue to see migration to the cloud-based software alternatives discussed above in our services offerings.
 Our Information Technology Systems
 We have committed significant resources to the IT systems that we own and use to manage our business and believe that our success is dependent upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our clients based on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems.  Because these systems affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, partner relationships and programs, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and our voice and data networks, we have built redundancy into certain systems, maintain system outage policies and procedures and have comprehensive data backup.  We are focused on driving improvements in sales productivity through upgraded IT systems to support higher levels of client satisfaction and new client acquisition, as well as garnering efficiencies in our business.  
 9

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
 
We operate under a single, standardized IT system across North America and APAC and a separate, single IT system platform in all countries in our EMEA operations.  We plan to migrate our EMEA operations to the same IT system used in North America and APAC.
 For a discussion of risks associated with our IT systems, see “Risk Factors – Disruptions in our IT systems and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Our Competition
 
The IT hardware, software and services industry is very fragmented and highly competitive.  Our competition includes:
 
 
• | Solution providers, value-added resellers and direct marketers such as CDW, Zones, Connection, PCM, SHI, Softchoice, Systemax, Computacenter, Bechtle, SoftwareONE, Comparex, and Crayon;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Systems integrators such as ePlus, Presidio, World Wide Technology, Perficient and Accenture;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specialty retailers, aggregators, distributors, and to a lesser extent, national computer retailers, computer superstores, Internet-only computer providers, consumer electronics and office supply superstores and mass merchandisers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product manufacturers, such as Dell, HP Inc., IBM, Lenovo and HPE;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Software publishers, such as IBM, Microsoft and Symantec;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | National and global service providers, such as IBM Global Services and HP Enterprise Services; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E-tailers, such as Amazon Web Services, Newegg, Buy.com and e-Buyer (United Kingdom).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The competitive landscape in the industry is continually changing as various competitors expand their product and services offerings.  In addition, emerging models such as cloud computing are creating new competitors and opportunities in messaging, infrastructure, security, collaboration and other services offerings, and, as with other areas, we compete both with resellers and directly with manufacturers, publishers or other service providers for many of these offerings.  Further, many of our manufacturer and publisher partners are also our competitors, as many sell directly to business customers, particularly larger corporate customers.
 For a discussion of risks associated with the actions of our competitors, see “Risk Factors – The IT hardware, software and services industry is intensely competitive, and actions of our competitors, including manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.  
 Our Partners
 We partner with market leaders offering the top technology brands as well as emerging entrants in the marketplace.  During 2018, we purchased products and software from approximately 3,500 partners.  Approximately 69% (based on dollar volume) of these purchases were directly from manufacturers or software publishers, with the balance purchased through distributors.  Purchases from Microsoft accounted for approximately 26% of our aggregate purchases in 2018.  No other partner accounted for more than 10% of purchases in 2018.  Our top five partners as a group for 2018 were Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Tech Data (a distributor), HP Inc. and Ingram Micro (a distributor), and approximately 60% of our total purchases during 2018 came from this group of partners.  Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of our product categories such that, with the exception of Microsoft, we are not dependent on any single partner for sourcing products.    
 During 2018, sales of Microsoft, Dell and Cisco Systems products accounted for approximately 18%, 11% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.  No other manufacturer’s products accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2018.  Sales of product from our top five manufacturers/publishers as a group (Microsoft, Dell, Cisco Systems, HP Inc. and Lenovo) accounted for approximately 56% of Insight’s consolidated net sales during 2018. 
 10

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
 
We obtain incentives from certain product manufacturers, software publishers and distribution partners based typically upon the volume of sales or purchases of their products and services.  In other cases, such incentives may be in the form of participation in our partner programs, which may require specific services or activities with our clients, discounts, marketing funds, price protection or rebates.  Manufacturers and publishers may also provide mailing lists, contacts or leads to us.  We believe that these incentives (or partner funding) and other marketing assistance allow us to increase our marketing reach and strengthen our relationships with leading manufacturers and publishers.  
 We are focused on understanding our partners’ objectives and developing plans and programs to grow our mutual businesses.  We have invested in our digital marketing capabilities over the past two years.  These digital marketing investments increase the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and client interactions.  Our partners are taking notice, and we believe that we are emerging as a leader in our industry as we consistently outpace our competition in digital marketing.  We implemented business intelligence tools that enable us to track performance in this area and demonstrate the return on our partners’ investments with us.  We measure partner satisfaction regularly and hold quarterly business reviews with our largest partners to review business results from the prior quarter, discuss plans for the future and obtain feedback.  Additionally, we host annual partner forums in North America, EMEA and APAC to articulate our plans for the upcoming year.
 As we move into new service areas, we may become even more reliant on certain partner relationships.  For a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on partners, see “Risk Factors – We rely on our partners for product availability, competitive products to sell and marketing funds and purchasing incentives, which can change significantly in the amounts made available and the requirements year over year,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Our Teammates
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed 7,420 teammates, of whom 2,455 were engaged in sales related activities, 2,424 were engaged in management, support services and administration activities, 2,384 were skilled, certified consulting and service delivery professionals and 157 were engaged in distribution activities.  Our teammates in the United States are not represented by a labor union.  Our workforces in certain foreign countries, such as Germany, have worker representative committees or work councils with which we maintain strong relationships.  We believe our relations with our teammates are good, and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage.  
 For a discussion of risks associated with our dependence on certain personnel, including sales personnel, see “Risk Factors – We depend on certain key personnel,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Our Seasonality
 We experience some seasonal trends in our sales of IT hardware, software and services.  For example:
  
• | software sales are typically higher in our second and fourth quarters, particularly the second quarter;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | business clients, particularly larger enterprise businesses in the United States, tend to spend more in our fourth quarter and less in the first quarter;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales to the federal government in the United States are often stronger in our third quarter, while sales in the state and local government and education markets are stronger in our second quarter; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales to public sector clients in the United Kingdom are often stronger in our first quarter.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These trends create overall seasonality in our consolidated results such that sales and profitability are expected to be higher in the second and fourth quarters of the year.  
 Our Backlog
 The majority of our backlog historically has been and continues to be open cancelable purchase orders.  We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is predictive of future results.

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 We do not maintain a traditional research and development group, but we do develop and seek to protect a range of intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain name rights, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property, relying for such protection on applicable statutes and common law rights, trade-secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements, as applicable, with teammates, clients, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights.  Our principal trademark is a registered mark, and we also license certain of our proprietary intellectual property rights to third parties.  We have registered a number of domain names, applied for registration of other marks in the United States and in certain international jurisdictions, and, from time to time, filed patent applications.  We believe our trademarks and service marks, in particular, have significant value, and we continue to invest in the promotion of our trademarks and service marks and in our protection of them. 
 For a discussion of risks associated with our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors – We may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
