Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing innovative products to address unmet needs in women’s sexual and reproductive health. We exist to advance the lives of women by developing innovative solutions, such as woman-controlled contraception and potential protection from certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We are leveraging our proprietary Multi-purpose Vaginal pH Regulator TM (MVP-R) platform to develop Amphora, which if approved will be the first on-demand and female controlled MVP-R birth control method in the U.S. 
Our MVP-R gel technology has both acid buffering and bio-adhesive properties and is designed to maintain an optimal vaginal pH of 3.5 to 4.5. This vaginal pH range is inhospitable to spermatozoa (sperm) as well as certain viral and bacterial pathogens associated with STIs, and it is integral to the survival of healthy bacteria in the vagina.
We are developing our lead MVP-R product candidate, Amphora (L-lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate), for three potential indications: prevention of pregnancy, prevention of urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection (chlamydia) in women and prevention of urogenital Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (gonorrhea) in women.
In 2014, we completed a randomized, Phase 3 non-inferiority trial for Amphora as a contraceptive in 3,389 women. Amphora was shown to be non-inferior to control when the complete data set was analyzed in accordance with the pre-specified statistical analysis plan, with a six-month cumulative pregnancy rate of 10.5% with typical use and 4.1% with perfect use. It was well-tolerated with less than 2% of patients experiencing possible treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs).
We conducted a second, single-arm Phase 3 trial for Amphora for the prevention of pregnancy in approximately 1,400 women in the United States (AMPOWER). The last patient exited the study in November 2018. We reported top-line data from AMPOWER in December 2018, which demonstrated a cumulative pregnancy rate of 14.0% over seven cycles of use (95% CI 10.0, 18.0) in the modified intention-to-treat population (referred to as "typical use") which meets the pre-determined endpoint of this clinical trial. This corresponds to an 86.0% efficacy rate. In women who correctly used Amphora following the study protocol, the cumulative pregnancy rate was 1.3% over seven cycles of use (95% CI 0.4, 2.1), which corresponds to a 98.7% efficacy rate. 
We plan to resubmit the New Drug Application (NDA) to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second quarter of 2019. Subject to acceptance and timely approval of the NDA by the FDA, we plan to commercialize Amphora in early 2020.
We believe Amphora is highly differentiated from other birth control methods currently available or in development. Amphora is hormone-free and, based on clinical data collected to date, does not exhibit known side effects of traditional hormone-based contraceptives, such as weight gain, headaches, sore breasts, irregular periods, mood changes, decreased sexual desire and nausea. Amphora is self-administered and we intend to seek regulatory approval for product labeling stating Amphora can be used on-demand, immediately before or up to one hour before intercourse. In addition, we anticipate Amphora may provide additional benefits beyond its primary use for prevention of pregnancy, including its lubricant effect for enhanced sexual satisfaction.
We are also conducting a Phase 2b clinical trial of Amphora for the prevention of urogenital transmission of chlamydia (primary endpoint) and gonorrhea (secondary endpoint) in women. We refer to this trial as AMPREVENCE. The primary endpoint of AMPREVENCE is 40% reduction in the incidence of chlamydia in women treated with Amphora versus placebo. Enrollment is underway at approximately 50 study centers in the United States; as of February 22, 2019, AMPREVENCE was over 89% enrolled. We envision our STI program as developing label expansion opportunities to further differentiate Amphora from other contraceptive products in the market.
Preclinical studies conducted by Rush University Medical Center (Rush University) suggest that our MVP-R gel technology may suppress many of the pathogens responsible for sexually transmitted and commonly occurring bacterial infections. Amphora has been granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation by the FDA for the prevention of gonorrhea in women. Our MVP-R gel has also been granted QIDP designation by the FDA for the prevention of the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis (BV). QIDP designation provides several key potential advantages, including qualification for the FDA Fast Track program and longer market exclusivity, among others. We also received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the development of Amphora for the prevention of chlamydia.
We are also advancing our MVP-R gel product candidate for the treatment of recurrent BV and intend to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate efficacy of this product candidate in this indication. In a Phase 1 dose-finding trial for this indication, the highest dose formulation of Amphora reduced vaginal pH for up to seven days following a single administration.

We have assembled a very strong management team with significant operational experience in the biopharmaceutical market. Specifically, our senior executives have a successful track record of developing and commercializing women’s health products including Mirena, Plan B One-Step, Yasmin, YAZ, NuvaRing, Paragard and Seasonique, among others.
Our Strategy
We are committed to providing women with direct control and management of their sexual and reproductive health. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Gain regulatory approval of and subsequently commercialize Amphora. Our initial focus is the development and successful commercialization of Amphora as the first hormone-free, non-invasive, woman-controlled contraceptive drug product. We intend to build an internal sales force to commercialize Amphora in the United States, if approved. Outside the United States, we intend to evaluate collaborations for commercialization. We believe this approach will allow us to effectively deploy our capital to maximize the inherent value of Amphora for the benefit of all stakeholders.


• | Leverage our MVP-R gel technology to develop and commercialize novel, first-in-class products for women. We intend to expand on our potential initial indication, prevention of pregnancy, by being the first company to market a birth control method with supplemental indications for the prevention of certain STIs. In addition, we are developing a product candidate for the reduction of recurrent BV, which, if approved, would be the only FDA-approved product for this indication.


• | Expand our intellectual property position by pursuing opportunities to extend the exclusivity of our highly differentiated and proprietary product candidates. We intend to aggressively pursue additional and new patent applications to broaden our intellectual property portfolio. We will continue seeking domestic and international patent protection and endeavor to proactively file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.


• | Build our product portfolio through business development. We intend to opportunistically acquire additional products or product candidates to enhance our offerings and complement our core competencies in women’s health. We will focus on business development in the near to intermediate term to identify compelling acquisition and licensing candidates.


• | Establish a world-class organization committed to the discovery, development and commercialization of products addressing unmet needs in women’s sexual and reproductive health. We have assembled a world-class team with industry-recognized expertise in the development and commercialization of products in women’s health. We intend to continue to build on our leadership position and grow a culture dedicated to the development and commercialization of medicines addressing the unmet needs of women.

Contraceptive Market Overview
In 2018, the global revenue for contraceptive products was approximately $24 billion and projected to grow at 6.8% per annum to exceed $35 billion by 2024, making contraception a substantial and growing subset of the overall healthcare market. This growth is expected to continue to be driven by the United States, where favorable government policies aimed at preventing unwanted pregnancies are in place.
Current contraceptive options include devices designed to prevent pregnancy through physical means such as condoms, diaphragms and intrauterine devices (IUDs), and hormone-based pharmaceutical products, including oral contraceptives, vaginal rings, intramuscular injections, subcutaneous implants and transdermal patches.
Existing contraceptive options can have significant side effects or other limitations. Long-acting options such as IUDs, injections and implants require medical procedures and are not quickly or easily reversible. Hormonal approaches can be associated with undesirable side effects such as weight gain, loss of libido and mood changes, which may lead women to seek alternative contraceptive technologies or decide not to use any form of contraceptive options currently available. Besides condoms, the only currently available over-the-counter (OTC) products are spermicides. These products are based on surfactants, which can cause genital irritation and inflammation that may increase the risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other STIs from an infected partner. As such, spermicides were pulled from most of the European market and are rarely used in the United States. In contrast to most existing contraceptive methods, Amphora is hormone-free; its mechanism of action is to regulate the vaginal pH at the normal healthy level, even in the presence of semen. It can be easily self-administered as needed, non-invasive, and has lubricating properties that may potentially enhance sexual satisfaction. Unlike other vaginal gel contraceptives currently on the market, Amphora is manufactured with ingredients that are generally recognized as safe, and is free of surfactants such as nonoxynol-9. We believe these combined attributes may make Amphora a more desirable option than currently marketed products.
The unmet needs in the contraceptive market and the shift away from traditional methods, such as oral contraceptives, make the entry of a non-hormonal birth control option like Amphora timely and desirable. Currently, the only non-hormonal prescription contraceptive methods approved in the United States market are a copper IUD and a diaphragm. A copper IUD is a device which requires an invasive, sometimes painful, medical procedure for insertion and may cause heavy menstrual bleeding. In addition, a copper IUD could remain in the user’s body for up to 10 years. A diaphragm is a device which can be difficult to insert and must be used with contraceptive gel.

We believe the growing concern associated with the increasing prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases along with the recognized need for MVP-Rs and the growing demand for new innovative contraception options that offer additional protective benefits will drive further growth in the global contraceptive market.
United States Contraceptive Market
The total United States prescription contraceptive market was valued at $5.5 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.4% from 2013 to 2024 reaching approximately $8.4 billion in 2024. The United States represented the largest segment of the global prescription contraceptives market in 2016 at 29.4% and is currently dominated by hormonal methods including birth control pills and other reversible methods such as hormone-releasing IUDs and injectables. Approximately four out of every five women with sexual experience in the United States have used the pill at least one time, which has remained stable since 1995.
As shown in the chart below, 16.8 million US women use no method of birth control, putting them at risk of pregnancy and an additional 9 million women in the United States rely on condoms or some other form of non-hormonal contraception (e.g., copper IUD, diaphragm, rhythm, withdrawal). Another 18.2 million women in the United States use hormone-based prescription birth control methods.
 European Union Contraceptive Market
The European Union (EU) contraceptive market was valued at approximately $5 billion in 2016, representing 23.5% of the global market, and is expected to grow at an average compound annual growth rate of 5.4% from 2013 to 2024, reaching approximately $7.6 billion in 2024. Approximately 25% of women in the EU use no contraception and 16.7% use condoms. Among newer products, only IUDs have a double-digit market share in the EU.
The greater European market (inclusive of the EU), eastern Europe, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has approximately 110 million women of reproductive age eligible for contraceptive use when accounting for factors including sterilization, sexuality, and sexual activity. An analysis of secondary market research from 2017 suggests that approximately 60 million of these women were found to showcase the characteristic of hormone avoidance or were hormone indifferent. Thus, we believe that Amphora will have the ability to significantly grow the European birth control market through the conversion of non-users, hormonal contraceptive users, and those who will supplement their current methods.

Asia Pacific (APAC) Contraceptive Market
 The Asia Pacific region consists of China, Japan, Korea, India, Indonesia, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. The total addressable market for hormone avoidance segment in the region is 285 million women with a majority of those women residing in the China, India, and Indonesia. The overall ease of entry across the APAC market varies significantly by country primarily due to their regulatory environment, as well as, strategic implications like pricing, competition, and the diversity of the consumer profile and her behaviors when purchasing or switching contraceptives. 
Market Opportunity
Innovation and new product introduction in the women’s reproductive healthcare arena have been limited when compared to other therapeutic categories. There have been no innovative contraceptives introduced in the United States since NuvaRing was approved in 2001. There are currently no FDA-approved contraceptive products that are indicated for the prevention of chlamydia or gonorrhea, nor for the reduction of the recurrence of BV.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reducing the percentage of all unintended pregnancies has been one of the National Health Promotion Objectives since their establishment in 1980. Despite efforts to reduce their incidence, over two million unintended pregnancies occur in the United States annually. Following decades of minimal change or increase, the percentage of unintended pregnancies in the United States decreased slightly in the period from 2008 to 2011. Despite this decrease, 45% of pregnancies in the United States are still unintended. Nearly all women with sexual experience in the United States have used some form of contraception in their lives. However, many women may not use contraception consistently or correctly, which may result in an unintended pregnancy. According to research conducted by the CDC, approximately 40% of women surveyed after giving birth to a child resulting from an unintended pregnancy who were not using contraception noted one of the following three reasons for nonuse: did not expect to have sex, worried about side effects of birth control, or male partner did not want to use birth control.
Hundreds of millions of women worldwide seek contraceptive products during their, on average, 30 plus years of fertility. As such, women utilizing contraception consider the most appropriate methods for their purposes and intended use. According to the United Nations, in 2017, model-based estimates indicate approximately 75% of women of reproductive age (18 to 49), worldwide, required some form of family planning. According to the Guttmacher Institute, there are approximately 62 million women of reproductive age in the United States. There are approximately 173 million women of reproductive age located in the greater European market. Additional attractive markets for global expansion include the APAC, where an addressable population of 829 million exist. Brazil and the Russian Federation represent an additional 78 million women of reproductive age in aggregate.
Our Product Candidates
Amphora as a Contraceptive
We believe Amphora, our lead MVP-R product candidate, addresses significant gaps in the contraceptive market. If approved by the FDA, Amphora will be the only hormone-free, woman-controlled contraceptive drug product available by prescription in the United States.
We believe Amphora has significant attributes that will make it an attractive contraceptive choice for women:
5


Key Attributes | Potential Benefits 
Hormone-free | Amphora is hormone-free and designed to avoid known side effects of hormone-based contraceptives, including weight gain, headaches, sore breasts, irregular periods, mood changes, decreased sexual desire, acne and nausea. These side effects have been shown to discourage women from continuing to use hormonal contraception on a long-term basis, leading them to seek alternative methods or decide to use nothing at all.
On-Demand/Woman-controlled | Amphora is designed to be used as needed – no need for consistent daily, weekly, or monthly routine – immediately before or up to one hour before intercourse at a woman’s discretion. 
Non-invasive | Unlike methods that require a physician to insert the device (i.e. IUD, Implant), Amphora is free from requiring the invasive procedure at the healthcare providers office. 
Personal Lubricant Properties | Amphora has benefits for use as a personal vaginal lubricant, beyond the primary contraceptive function. We believe Amphora’s personal lubricant properties can reduce friction and ease penetration, enhancing sexual satisfaction. 
Ease of Use | The pre-filled Amphora applicator is designed for convenience and to be stored at room temperature for ease of handling and use. 
Bio-adhesive Properties | Amphora has bio-adhesive and viscosity-retaining properties to form a long-lasting layer of gel over the vaginal and cervical surfaces, which may reduce leakage from the vagina. 
No Weight Restrictions | Amphora is designed to be used by women of any Body Mass Index with no weight restrictions, unlike many traditional hormonal birth control options. 
No Surgical Procedures | No physician insertion or removal required. The use of Amphora is private and discrete, requiring no need for recurring doctor appointments, or clinical or surgical procedures. 
Cost Effective | We anticipate mandated coverage in the United States under the Affordable Care Act (the ACA). Amphora is only used when needed, thereby eliminating cost for daily use methods. 

The CDC’s recommendations for use of combined hormonal birth control options, as shown below, define numerous conditions that create unacceptable health risks if hormonal contraception is used (known as Category 4). The number of women impacted by these conditions is significant. We believe Amphora, if approved by the FDA, will provide women an attractive solution to avoid hormones and certain other negative side effects from current prescription contraceptives.
Category 4 (a condition that represents an unacceptable health risk if 
hormonal contraception is used)

• | Postpartum < 21 days


• | Deep venous thrombosis (current or history with higher risk of recurrence)


• | Pulmonary embolism (current or history with higher risk of recurrence)


• | Cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (preexisting)


• | Uncontrolled hypertension


• | Major surgery with prolonged immobilization


• | Known thrombogenic mutations


• | Migraine headaches with aura or without aura in women >/= 35


• | Viral Hepatitis (acute or flare)


• | Cirrhosis (decompensated)


• | Age > 35 years and smoke 15 cigarettes or more per day


• | Valvular heart disease (complicated)


• | Impaired cardiac function (moderate or severe)


• | Systemic lupus erythematosus with positive or unknown antiphospholipid antibodies


• | Ischemic heart disease (current or history)

6


• | Stroke (history)


• | Diabetes (complicated)


• | Breast cancer (current)


• | Certain liver tumors


• | Solid organ transplantation (complicated)

If approved by the FDA, Amphora is potentially disruptive to the existing contraceptive landscape and is designed to address underserved and unmet needs in the birth control market, as seen in the table below. We expect to appeal to the 16.8 million women who are currently using no method of birth control, as well as, benefit from a favorable shift away from the daily use of oral forms of hormonal birth control options to more innovative technologies that underpin the large and growing global contraceptive market.

We conducted initial market research studies with 152 healthcare providers and 100 obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYNs). On a scale of 1-10, approximately 40% of healthcare providers rated their likelihood to prescribe a contraceptive-only version of Amphora as an 8, 9 or 10. With the added ability to prevent an STI, over 50% of OB/GYNs rated their likelihood to prescribe Amphora as an 8, 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale.
 We conducted additional market research studies with 1024 healthcare providers (476 OB/GYNs, 222 Clinical Staff, and 326 Primary Care Physicians) where we were able to identify those providers whose attitudes indicate they’re the most likely to adopt Amphora early in the launch process. When asked about the likelihood to prescribe once launched, respondents indicated their patients would use Amphora as their primary form of birth control 15% of the time, which ranks second behind the use of birth control pills. 
Similar to our healthcare provider and OB/GYN research, we conducted two separate market research studies with women of reproductive age and healthcare providers in the United States to evaluate potential interest in Amphora. This market research provided insight on the reasons why Amphora is appealing, which included the attributes of being non-hormonal and woman-controlled. In one of our market research studies, 71% of the women expressed concerns about hormonal exposure and 58% were not currently satisfied with their contraceptive choice. Our research confirmed there are multiple consumer segments of interest including women seeking prevention of pregnancy and STIs, or older, monogamous women seeking an alternative to hormones and condoms. Overall, approximately 40% of women in two different samples of 287 and 206 consumers rated their likelihood to use Amphora as an 8, 9, or 10 on a 10-point scale.
Multi-purpose Vaginal pH Regulator TM Birth Control Mechanism of Action
A normal vaginal pH of 3.5 to 4.5 is important for maintaining good vaginal health. At this optimal pH level, the vagina contains a balance of necessary healthy bacteria. Additionally, a vaginal pH in this range is inhospitable to sperm as well as certain viral and bacterial pathogens. Amphora was developed to have acid-buffering (pH 3.5), bio-adhesive, and viscosity-retaining properties to provide effective acidification of the male ejaculate in the vagina and to form a long-lasting layer of gel over the vaginal and cervical surfaces. Typically, the introduction of semen (pH = 7.2-8.0) into the vagina causes a rise in pH above 6.0 due to the alkalinity of the ejaculate, which neutralizes the normally acidic vaginal environment, and allows for the survival of sperm. Amphora prevents pregnancy by maintaining a normal vaginal pH (pH = 3.5-4.5) even in the presence of semen, inhibiting sperm from reaching the ovum to form a zygote. This buffering capacity is due to Amphora’s active pharmaceutical ingredients. Other MVP-R properties contributing to Amphora's mechanism of action are its capacity to immobilize sperm, maintain sufficient viscosity even upon dilution with the introduction of semen into the vagina and its bio-adhesive strength. Early clinical testing indicated Amphora may remain active when inserted up to 10 hours prior to intercourse.

The diagram below shows the respective pH levels of the vagina and semen.
 Amphora Clinical Trials
AMP001 Phase 3 Clinical Trial
A key stage in the development of Amphora was the completion of a large-scale Phase 3 clinical trial comparing the contraceptive effectiveness, safety and acceptability of Amphora to Conceptrol, a surfactant-based spermicidal gel containing 4% nonoxynol-9, which is currently available over-the-counter for use as a vaginal contraceptive. The primary endpoint of the trial was the six-month cumulative pregnancy rate. Secondary endpoints included local and systemic signs and symptoms reported by participants or observed upon medical examination, such as itching, burning, irritation, inflammation or lesions to the cervical or vaginal epithelia and vaginal infections.
AMP001 enrolled 3,389 women at 62 research centers in the United States and Russia. This open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial evaluated the repeated use of Amphora compared to Conceptrol over seven menstrual cycles. After completing the first seven cycles, some of the women randomized to Amphora continued for up to a total of 13 cycles (n=341). In a subset of women (75 in each treatment arm) the lower genital tract (cervix, vagina, and vulva) was observed and photographed by colposcopy. The subset was blinded to avoid possible observer bias. A second subset was also examined microbiologically to document any changes in the vaginal flora, particularly the onset of any infection by Escherichia coli or yeast.
The trial was fully enrolled in July 2013 and completed during the first half of 2014. In the primary efficacy analysis, the six-month cumulative pregnancy rate for typical use (defined as trial subjects who had at least one episode of coitus without using the product correctly during the study and without any backup or emergency contraception), was approximately 10.5% for Amphora, as compared to 10.0% for Conceptrol. For those subjects with perfect use (defined as trial subjects who used the product correctly at every episode of coitus within a given cycle), the cumulative pregnancy rate was approximately 4.1% for Amphora, as compared to 4.2% for Conceptrol. In summary, Amphora met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to Conceptrol when the combined United States and Russian data were analyzed in accordance with the pre-specified statistical analysis plan.
Less than 2% of patients using Amphora experienced an AE that was “definitely” related to treatment. There were no SAEs deemed “definitely” or “probably” related to Amphora. Of the 30 subjects who experienced at least one SAE, 11 were treated with Amphora (0.8%) and 19 were treated with Conceptrol (1.3%). There were no SAEs reported in the cycle 8-13 extension phase. Significantly more subjects were highly satisfied Amphora as compared to Conceptrol and significantly more Amphora users would use the product again if it were available (p<0.05 for both comparisons).
Summary of Initial NDA Submission (Contraceptive Indication)
On July 2, 2015, pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act we submitted an NDA for Amphora to the FDA for the proposed indication of prevention of pregnancy. The submission included, among other things, data from the initial Phase 3 clinical trial (AMP001) as well as other safety and efficacy information.
A Complete Response Letter (CRL) was issued by the FDA on April 28, 2016. A CRL is issued if the agency determines an application cannot be approved in its present form and will describe all the specific deficiencies identified by the agency. A CRL will also recommend actions the applicant might take to place the application or abbreviated application in condition for approval.
The primary approvability issue was the difference in results between the United States and Russian cohorts. Although the study met its primary endpoint when the combined United States and Russian data were analyzed per the statistical plan, the 
8

FDA deemed the data from Russian subjects (approximately 20% of the study population) not generalizable to the United States population. Additionally, the FDA excluded analysis data from certain cycles, specifically data from: cycle 0 (the time from enrollment until the subject’s first menstrual cycle); cycles <21 days or >42 days in duration; cycles past 196 days (the aggregate length of seven cycles of 28 days in duration); and cycles in which there was no intercourse.
A Type A meeting was held on October 31, 2016 with the FDA, during which the FDA indicated a confirmatory efficacy trial focused on participants in North America would be required. After further consultation with the FDA, the FDA confirmed a single-arm trial (non-comparative) would be sufficient to address the CRL clinical deficiency. All feedback received from the FDA was incorporated into a protocol for a single-arm trial which was submitted to the FDA on June 30, 2017 (AMPOWER).
 Phase 3 Trial (AMPOWER)
We conducted a second, single-arm, Phase 3 trial entitled “A Single-Arm, Phase III, Open Label, Multicenter, Study in Women Aged 18-35 Years of the Contraceptive Efficacy and Safety of Amphora Contraceptive Vaginal Gel.” We refer to this trial as AMPOWER. AMPOWER enrolled approximately 1,400 women aged 18 to 35 at 112 sites in the United States. The first subject enrolled in this trial on July 28, 2017, and enrollment was completed in February 2018. We reported top-line data from AMPOWER in December 2018 and plan to resubmit the NDA for Amphora for the prevention of pregnancy to the FDA in the second quarter of 2019. Per the FDA Performance Goals under PDUFA VI, the FDA review timeline for this type of Class 2 resubmitted NDA is six months.
The primary endpoint of the study was the pregnancy rate over seven cycles of use (one cycle 21-35 days) as assessed by the Kaplan-Meier statistical method. Top-line data analysis demonstrates a cumulative pregnancy rate of 14.0% over seven cycles of use (95% CI 10.0, 18.0) in the mITT population (referred to as typical use), which meets the pre-determined endpoint of this clinical trial. This corresponds to an 86.0% efficacy rate.
In women who correctly used Amphora following the study protocol, the cumulative pregnancy rate was 1.3% over seven cycles of use (95% CI 0.4, 2.1), which corresponds to a 98.7% efficacy rate. The "perfect use" or "per protocol” population is a subset of the overall use or “typical” use population that includes all cycles in which the product was used. For a subject to qualify for the perfect use population, she had to indicate via her E-diary that she used the product correctly and without use of another contraceptive method for every act of intercourse for at least one cycle. The results demonstrate that when Amphora is used as directed, the efficacy is similar to other frequently used contraceptive methods.
Overall in the AMPOWER study there were more than 24,000 acts of intercourse in which Amphora use was reported and of these, Amphora was used as directed 88.9% of the time. Less than 2% of women in AMPOWER discontinued due to an adverse event and there were no treatment related serious adverse events. There were minimal side effects reported by AMPOWER study participants. 
 Adverse events in greater than 2% of Amphora treated subjects in AMPOWER (safety population):

In addition to the prevention of pregnancy outcome and secondary safety outcomes, this trial also included an exploratory endpoint of sexual satisfaction, which could be further explored in future trials and potentially utilized in labeling and marketing materials for Amphora. We believe this is the first contraceptive registration trial to include sexual satisfaction as an outcome.
Scientific Advice Process in the EU
We previously conducted a regulatory gap analysis with Pharmalex GmbH to determine how the EU regulatory bodies were likely to view its marketing authorization application (MAA) upon submission to the EU. Scientific advice was previously sought in April 2016 from the Medical Products Agency of Sweden and the Agency of Medicine and Sanitary Products of Spain, but an MAA was not pursued due to a lack of resources to support a filing at that time. We have reinitiated the scientific advice process and plan to seek marketing authorization for Amphora in the EU through a collaboration with a licensing partner.
Amphora for STI Prevention
In the United States, the CDC reported there were 1.7 million new cases of chlamydia and approximately 556,000 new cases of gonorrhea in 2017. We believe this represents a significant commercial opportunity for Amphora.
Preclinical tests conducted in the early developmental stages by Rush University and later by us, suggest Amphora has the potential to suppress many of the pathogens responsible for sexually transmitted and commonly occurring bacterial infections while not affecting lactobacilli, a normal and beneficial bacterium found in a healthy vagina.
Researchers at Rush University conducted preclinical studies to assess the ability of Amphora to prevent transmission of chlamydia in mice. Data from these studies showed Amphora was highly effective at preventing upper and lower genital tract infection when compared to various vaginally-administered controls containing nonoxynol-9. The following table summarizes the results from the mouse study showing the protective effect of Amphora compared to several other vaginal gels or no treatment in the upper and lower genital tract.

In another study, Amphora (at the time called ACIDFORM) was tested for its ability to prevent transmission of gonorrhea in the genital tract compared to other vaginal microbicides in mice. Amphora displayed significant protection against transmission of gonorrhea, with only 1 of 17 Amphora-treated mice having positive gonorrhea culture results, compared with 13 of 15 untreated control mice. The following table represents recovery rates from gonorrhea in mice receiving pretreatment or no treatment before intravaginal challenge with gonorrhea strain FA1090:

Building on the microbicide potential of Amphora demonstrated in preclinical trials, we are currently conducting a double-blinded, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 2b trial to evaluate the efficacy of Amphora for the prevention of sexual transmission of two common STIs, chlamydia (primary endpoint) and gonorrhea (secondary endpoint). This trial is designed to enroll 844 women 18 to 45 years of age at approximately 50 sites in the United States. Should this trial meet its primary endpoint, the FDA has indicated it may be considered as one of two pivotal trials required for approval of Amphora for the prevention of chlamydia in women, for which it has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. The FDA’s Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process of reviewing new drugs and provides eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met.
As previously noted, Amphora has been granted QIDP designation by the FDA for the prevention of gonorrhea in women.
MVP-R Gel BV Product Candidate
BV effects an estimated 21 million women, or 29.2% of women of reproductive age in the United States, and is considered to be the most common reproductive tract infection for women. Data suggests BV recurs in up to 58% of women within the first 12 months of treatment. There are currently no FDA-approved products indicated for the reduction of recurrent BV.
Preclinical tests have shown our investigational MVP-R gel product kills many of the microbes responsible for BV. The inhibitory mechanism comprises our BV product candidate’s buffered acidity and the presence of active pharmaceutical ingredients in the MVP-R gel.
We filed an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA in March 2016 to study the ability of our BV product candidate to reduce recurrent BV. Following submission of the IND, we conducted a Phase 1 trial (EVO-002) to evaluate the ability of a single vaginal administration of our BV product candidate at three different doses to reduce vaginal pH. The trial was completed in late 2016 and revealed the highest dose evaluated (5-gram) reduced vaginal pH for up to seven days following a single administration compared to placebo gel or no gel. We are currently designing a Phase 2 trial to examine the ability of a 5-gram dose of our BV product candidate to reduce recurrent BV versus placebo gel. 
As previously noted, Amphora has been granted QIDP designation by the FDA for the prevention of the recurrence of BV.
Commercialization Strategy
We plan to implement a global strategy to commercialize Amphora, if approved. In the United States, our plan is to build our own integrated sales and marketing infrastructure. Outside of the United States, we expect to leverage global pharmaceutical companies or other qualified potential partners to license commercialization rights or enter collaborations for the commercialization and distribution of Amphora.
While awaiting the decision from the FDA as to the approval of Amphora, our planned pre-commercialization activities will include:

• | the selection of commercial suppliers, which includes agency of record for the Amphora brand, hiring of sales and sales support personnel to support our anticipated commercialization of Amphora, initiation of payer programs including the addition of medical science liaisons and national/key account managers, and the selection of third-party logistic provider(s); and


• | the optimization of manufacturing capabilities to include the installation of new equipment into manufacturers’ facilities, planning and preparing for all requisite inspections, planning for process validation and registration batch quantities, and establishing secondary (back-up) manufacturing capability.

United States
We estimate the United States market is the largest commercial opportunity for our product candidates. If Amphora is approved for commercialization by the FDA, we intend to establish a commercial sales force to market Amphora directly to obstetricians and OB/GYNs who write the majority of prescriptions for contraceptive products.
The top 10% of prescribers (98% of which are OB/GYNs) account for 46% of the annual contraception prescriptions in the United States. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) reports there are approximately 36,000 fellows currently practicing in the United States. We intend to target the top 30% by deploying a sales force of approximately 100 sales representatives and managers. Our healthcare provider segmentation project will aid in our targeting of those high volume potential providers whose attitudes suggest they will be early adopters based on their beliefs that the best form of birth control for women is one they will use. Evofem's sales team will be complemented by print and digital advertising, social media campaigns, access programs, educational campaigns, and non-personal promotion campaigns targeting both consumers and healthcare providers.
Successful prescription drug market launches require comprehensive and integrated pre-launch activities. During the pre-commercialization phase for Amphora, we intend to assemble an experienced team of key account managers and medical science liaisons expected to focus on ensuring key payer accounts, pharmacy benefit managers, key opinion leaders and 
12

medical associations who are educated about the need to offer a wider set of options to women seeking non-hormonal, woman-controlled contraceptive methods. We expect these educational activities will be supported by presentation of clinical data at key national congresses (such as the annual meetings of ACOG and the Society of Family Planning), clinical publications, and additional market development activities. Our pre- and post-commercialization activities are expected to include multi-channel marketing campaigns to raise brand awareness, including direct-to-consumer and health care professional campaigns. These key initiatives will be supported by awareness campaigns in social media, online and print advertisements, paid and earned social media support, and public relations efforts. We expect these campaigns to encourage patients to consult their healthcare providers and ensure payer and healthcare provider strategies are implemented.
Ex-United States Markets
In markets outside of the United States, if our MVP-R product candidate is approved for marketing in an individual market, we intend to establish regional and/or global partnerships by either sublicensing the commercialization rights or entering into distribution agreements with one or more third parties for the commercialization of the applicable product candidate in that market.
Payer and Reimbursement Strategy
United States
We have conducted market research with 45 different healthcare plans covering approximately 80% of covered lives within the United States to better understand viable access and pricing strategies for Amphora. Overall, a majority of respondents were positive about the introduction of a new contraceptive method. These respondents cited the many unintended pregnancies, high costs associated with unwanted pregnancies, and the underlying limitations in the contraceptive category (i.e. the lack of non-hormonal options) as reasons a new contraceptive option is desirable. We aim to have approximately 60% of all commercial healthcare plans offering full access and complete coverage of Amphora for all the reproductive aged women’s lives they are managing by the end of the first year of commercialization of Amphora. This coverage is expected to build to approximately 85% to 90% at peak sales.
Pricing Strategy
Overall, healthcare plans appear receptive to the idea of pricing Amphora like that of branded oral contraceptives. Healthcare plans interviewed during market research expected Amphora to be priced between $100 and $200 for a monthly supply of a 12-applicator box (comparable to branded contraceptives), believing Amphora would ultimately offset other costs the payer may incur (i.e. unwanted pregnancies).
Third-party Payers
Market acceptance and sales of Amphora and our other MVP-R gel product candidate, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products will be available from third-party payers, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payers decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payers in the United States often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates we develop will be made on a payer-by-payer basis. One payer’s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure other payers will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical and medical device products. The United States government and other third-party payers are increasingly limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and medical devices, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may incur significant costs to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Third-party payer coverage may not be available to patients for Amphora or any future product we may seek to commercialize. If third-party payers do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for Amphora or our other product candidates, healthcare providers may not prescribe them or patients may ask their healthcare providers to prescribe competing products with more favorable reimbursement.
Managed care organizations and other private insurers frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions. Consolidation among managed care organizations has increased the negotiating power of these entities. Third-party payers increasingly employ formularies, which might not include all the approved products for a particular indication, to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. We intend to target those healthcare plans managing the largest number of covered lives to achieve optimal access for our product portfolio.

Europe
Our market research found that EU consumers were interested in the unique benefits of Amphora product profiles, especially since Amphora is non-hormonal. Contraceptive products are not reimbursed in all the EU member countries. For example, in Italy there is no coverage for contraceptives, in France and Spain, only oral contraceptives are generally covered, and in Germany, individual reimbursement policies apply.
Pricing and reimbursement
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement strategies vary widely from country to country. Some countries mandate that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed, while others may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of offering a drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense, creating increasingly high barriers for entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from lower-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Therefore, the development of new drug launch strategies has become very challenging to meet both patient need/demand while ensuring products are commercially viable in those markets.
 APAC
 We believe the APAC region offers a major commercial opportunity across multiple regions in the Asia Pacific with 30% of women indicating they have hormonal avoidance tendencies. China is the largest overall market opportunity in terms of both population size and total birth control market value. Japan is the second largest in terms of total birth control market value. When looking at the opportunity in terms of frequency of birth control usage, China and India are the two largest APAC markets. China is the most significant commercial opportunity for the birth control/STI MVP-R gel followed by India and Indonesia due to their ease of market entry and their sizeable market opportunities. 
 Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In APAC, the patient journey to birth control, whether it is prescription or over-the-counter, differs based on the level of involvement from healthcare providers. However, since a majority of women access birth control over-the-counter in the APAC region, it will be important to develop a pricing strategy that considers the average price per sexual encounter by the type of birth control method. Further, an inclusive regional strategy will be required to contemplate consumer behaviors and key influencers as a part of go to market strategy in each of these regions to ensure commercial viability. 
Amphora Manufacturing
We plan to outsource the manufacturing of Amphora (and our other potential product candidates) to third parties. Currently, we have contracted with a third party to manufacture our clinical supplies of Amphora. This third party has agreed to manufacture Amphora and potential other product candidates in accordance with all applicable current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) regulations, as well as in compliance with all applicable laws and other relevant regulatory agency requirements for manufacture of pharmaceutical drug products and combination drug-device products.
Competition
As shown below, the contraception market was established in 1960 with the introduction of “the pill,” the first oral contraceptive widely available to women in the United States. This high-dose hormonal option remained the primary form of available contraception on the market until 1988 when the copper IUD was introduced, offering the first hormone-free option for birth control. As shown in the time line below, there was no notable innovation providing additional options in women’s reproductive health until 30 years after the introduction of “the pill,” when pharmaceutical companies introduced synthetic hormonal products with different hormonal delivery systems, including the hormonal IUD, implants, the patch, and vaginal ring.
14


 If approved, we expect that Amphora will grow the prescription birth control user market when considering the 16.8 million women who are currently at risk for pregnancy and using no form of contraception. Additionally, we expect Amphora to 
compete for market share in at least four categories: 1) oral contraception, 2) Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC), comprising IUDs, implants, and injectables, 3) non-oral hormonal contraceptives, comprising weekly or monthly options including the patch and vaginal ring, and 4) OTC methods, dominated primarily by the condom.
Oral Contraceptives (the “pill”)
The pill is the most commonly used form of birth control in the United States today. Birth control pills are marketed under a variety of brand names, and currently, there are only two promoted branded pills — Lo Lostrin® FE (Allergan) and Natazia® (Bayer). There are two main kinds of oral contraceptives — combination birth control pills, which contain estrogen and progestin, and the “mini pill,” which contains only progestin. Oral contraceptives typically must be taken on a regular or daily basis to be effective.
LARC
Implants
The contraception implant (principally marketed in the United States as Nexplanon® by a subsidiary of Merck & Co.), which must be implanted under the skin and removed by a qualified healthcare provider, requiring a medical procedure, provides contraception by releasing hormones over a three-year period. The implant has realized an increase in market share over the past five years, outpacing the overall contraceptive category year-over-year, with annual sales in the United States of approximately $496 million.
IUDs
The copper IUD was introduced to the market in 1988 and provides protection by disrupting sperm motility and damaging sperm so that they are prevented from joining with an ovum. Today, the copper IUD is principally marketed by Cooper Surgical, Inc. as Paragard. The hormonal IUD is principally offered under the brand names, Kyleena®, Skyla® and Mirena, a family of products from Bayer Pharmaceuticals. IUDs have annual sales in North America of approximately $1.3 billion. All IUDs must be inserted or removed by a physician.
The LARCs are not dependent on user adherence, which appeals to those who benefit from a passive form of birth control with no daily requirement to take a pill. However, many women have decided to remove their LARC due to the hormonal side effects they experience.
Non-oral, Hormonal Contraceptives
Contraceptive Patch
The weekly contraceptive patch was introduced in 2000 by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division; however, deaths resulting from venous thromboembolism due to hormonal exposure had a significant negative impact on the patch and led to label changes restricting utilization. Following the loss of exclusivity, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen division exited women’s healthcare and contraception as a promotional category.
Vaginal Ring
The hormonal vaginal ring by Merck & Co. was introduced to the market in 2001 and had annual sales in 2017 in the United States of approximately $564 million. The ring is used for three weeks and then removed for a week during menses and a new hormonal vaginal ring is inserted. The efficacy for the vaginal ring is similar to hormonal oral contraception. Users of the vaginal ring report the same incidence of hormonal related side effects as those using oral hormonal contraception.
Injectables
The primary injectable hormonal contraceptive on the market is Depo-Provera® offered by Pfizer Inc. Each injection provides protection for up to 12 to 14 weeks, but patients must receive injections once every 12 weeks to get full contraceptive protection. Depo-Provera was introduced to the market in 1992 and has annual sales in the United States of approximately $211 million.
Non-prescription OTC
Condoms are the dominate product offering in OTC sales. They are manufactured primarily by Trojan (Church & Dwight) and Durex (Reckitt Benckiser) brands, with approximately six million women who depend on condom use as their only method of birth control. The market size in the United States for condoms in 2017 was over $1.3 billion. In addition, spermicides are also available in sponges, jelly/creams, and foams and have very limited utilization.
15

The adoption of Amphora, if approved, is expected to come equally from each category discussed, as interest in Amphora falls into two distinct segments: (1) those women seeking an alternative to hormonal contraception; and (2) those women who are expected to utilize Amphora as added protection to their current form of birth control. Our market research has indicated that the hormone-free, woman-controlled aspect of Amphora makes it an attractive option across the entire competitive set.
Rush License Agreement
We amended and restated our license agreement with Rush University (the Rush License Agreement), pursuant to which Rush University granted us an exclusive, worldwide license of certain patents and know-how (the Rush Licensed IP) related to our MVP-R gel technology authorizing us to make, distribute and commercialize products and processes for any and all therapeutic, prophylactic and/or diagnostic uses, including, without limitation, use for female vaginal health and/or contraception.
As further described in the Rush License Agreement, we are under an obligation to make tiered royalty payments in the mid-single digits to Rush University based on net sales of products and/or processes that are claimed in the patents or the know-how licensed to us under the Rush License Agreement. To the extent one of our products is not claimed in a licensed patent but does utilize the licensed know-how, the applicable royalty rate to such product and/or processes would be reduced.
In addition, if during the three years after one of our products or processes has received regulatory approval and is introduced to the market, if the amounts paid to Rush University as royalties or sublicensing fees do not total a minimum royalty amount, then we must pay a minimum annual royalty to Rush University. If we have to pay a royalty or other payment to a third party in order for us to avoid infringement of third-party rights, we may offset up to 50% owed to such third party by up to 50% of the amounts owed to Rush University under the Rush License. The above-described royalty payments expire upon termination of the Rush License Agreement in accordance with its terms.
We also have the right to sub-license our rights to affiliates (without the prior approval of Rush University) and to third parties (with the prior written approval of Rush University, not to be unreasonably delayed or conditioned). To the extent Rush University approves of a third-party sub-license, in lieu of any royalty payment obligation under the Rush License Agreement, we would then be under an obligation to pay Rush University a sub-license fee equal to a percentage of any sublicensing revenue received from any third-party sub-licensee.
Pursuant to the Rush License Agreement, Rush University, its affiliates and/or its sublicensees have the right in the form of a royalty free, non-exclusive license from us under the applicable patents and know-how to use the technology embodied by such patents and know-how for non-commercial research purposes.
The Rush License Agreement provides that we must use our best efforts to bring one or more products or processes based on the licensed patents to market, and to continue diligent marketing efforts for one or more such products or processes during the term of the agreement. Additionally, within one month of the end of each fiscal quarter until the date of first commercial sale of a product, we must provide Rush University with a written development report summarizing our product development activities since the prior such report, as well as any necessary adjustments to the plan of development.
The Rush License Agreement contains additional customary representations and warranties, insurance and confidentiality provisions and is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, except that questions affecting the licensed patents will be determined in accordance with the national law of the country in which the applicable patent was granted. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to pursue potential infringers of the licensed patents technology and know-how and the prior written approval of Rush University is required to settle any related claim.
We have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Rush University, its employees and certain other related parties from and against any and all liabilities, damages, settlements, penalties, fines, costs or expenses arising out of any claim, complaint, suit, proceeding or cause of action brought against the relevant indemnity by a third party alleging damage arising from or occurring as a result of the activities performed by or under the authority of us, our affiliates or sub-licensees in connection with the exercise of our licenses and rights under the Rush License Agreement, except to the extent caused by Rush University’s negligence or willful misconduct.
Unless terminated in accordance with its terms, the term of the Rush License Agreement continues until the expiration, revocation or invalidation of the last of the patents or the abandonment of the last patent application included within the licensed patents and technology, which includes any patent claiming an improvement made within the term of the Rush License Agreement in the course of research supported or developed by Rush University utilizing the technology.
The Rush License Agreement may be terminated upon mutual written consent of both parties or by a non-breaching party if the other party commits a breach or default of any covenant in the agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of such breach or default.
If we are in default of our obligations under the Rush License Agreement and such default has not been cured within thirty (30) days, Rush University has the option to: (a) terminate the Rush License Agreement; or (b) convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license (subject to the rights of any pre-approved sub-licensee under any pre-approved sub-license). 
16

Termination of the Rush License Agreement or conversion to a non-exclusive license shall give Rush University the right to terminate all sub-licenses granted by us that were not approved by Rush University. If Rush University declines to terminate any such sub-license agreement (or such sub-license agreement was approved by Rush University) then: (a) in the case of termination of the Rush License Agreement, the sub-license agreement shall become a direct agreement between Rush University and the relevant sub-licensee; and (b) in the case of conversion of the Rush License Agreement license to a non-exclusive license, such license shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
In addition, Rush University may terminate the agreement: (i) upon thirty (30) days’ notice in the event that the aggregate royalties paid under such agreement in any calendar year following March 27, 2017 do not equal a minimum of at least $50,000, except that we may pay to Rush University the difference between the royalties actually paid and $50,000 to prevent Rush University from so terminating the Rush License Agreement, and under such circumstances the Rush License Agreement will continue for an additional two (2) years beyond March 27, 2017, or until March 27, 2019; and (ii) in a given country as regards our rights in such country, upon sixty (60) days’ notice if, prior to March 27, 2022, we have not, in such country, engaged in certain specified activities in such country in an effort to exploit the products and processes covered by the licensed patents and technology in such country. To date, we have not paid any royalties pursuant to the Rush License Agreement. However, to the extent an extension of the Rush License Agreement is required, we believe we would be able to obtain such an extension on commercially reasonable terms.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary MVP-R gel technology both internationally and domestically. We seek and maintain patents intended to cover our product candidates, and their methods of use, as well as any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We endeavor to properly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions. We also may rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, and other intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We will also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of February 22, 2019, we owned 29 issued patents and allowed applications in the United States and other countries and jurisdictions, and had 31 applications pending in the United States and other countries and jurisdictions.
We have an exclusive worldwide license to a portfolio of licensed patents held by Rush University, which provide general protection for our MVP-R gel asset, which expire in 2021 and could be eligible for extensions to at least 2024 in the United States and to 2026 in certain European jurisdictions, if granted by those regulatory bodies. Further, we solely own several patent application families relating to the composition and therapeutic use of our MVP-R gel, which, upon issue, would expire at the earliest in 2033. We believe that our licensed and solely owned non-hormonal birth control gel patents and pending patent applications combined with our substantial know-how in this field, will continue to provide opportunities for us to establish a significant barrier to competitor entry into the market.
In addition, we commissioned an expert opinion in 2015 whose view was that bioequivalence for our MVP-R gel would be difficult to show, thus making it potentially more difficult to develop a generic version of our MVP-R gel.
In addition to patents, we rely, and expect to rely, on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive positions. For example, certain aspects of the composition, manufacturing, and use of Amphora are protected by unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Although trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, collaborators, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for these incidents. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting intellectual property, including trade secret, know-how and inventions.

Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Healthcare providers and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products and medical devices that are granted marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, third-party payers and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include but are not limited to the following:
Anti-Kickback Statute — the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Civil and Criminal False Claims Laws — the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower and qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 — the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making any false statements relating to healthcare matters; as in the case of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation; additionally, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization, on entities subject to the law, such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the creation, use, maintenance or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information;
False Statements Statute — the federal False Statements Statutes prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
Stark Law — the federal ban on physician self-referrals prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationships, including compensation arrangements or ownership interests, with that entity.
Sunshine Act — the federal transparency or “sunshine” requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA) requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS) information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act — The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA) and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the FDCA by the FDA govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products as well as so-called combination products, such as those
consisting of a drug and a delivery device. Failure to comply with applicable FDA pre-market, post-market, or other compliance requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
State Transparency Laws — Some United States state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to healthcare providers and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; and some state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.

State and Foreign Regulatory Concerns — There are analogous State and foreign laws and regulations, such as State Anti-Kickback and False Claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health and personal information. These laws differ from each other in significant ways while applying simultaneously with HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change. Regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with these laws will involve substantial costs. Any investigation of us or the third parties with whom we contract, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, debarment under the FDCA, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things:
(i) mandates that preventative services which have strong scientific evidence of health benefits, including in some cases contraception, must be fully covered certain private third-party payers when they are delivered by an in-network provider; (ii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (iii) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (iv) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (v) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP); (vi) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; (vii) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70%, commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (ix) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost 
19

employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA), among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the ACA and its possible repeal or replacement on our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
United States
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDA, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products or medical devices are regulated as “combination products” in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprising of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. To facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. Amphora is subject to review by the FDA, and it is anticipated that Amphora will be regulated as a drug/device combination product with a drug mode of action that requires the submission and approval of an NDA by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research prior to marketing.
FDA Drug Approval Process
Amphora and our other MVP-R product candidates may not be marketed in the United States until the product has received FDA approval. The steps to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include:

• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication to the FDA’s satisfaction;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations;


• | Satisfactory completion of FDA bioresearch monitoring inspections of selected investigational sites at which the drug product was subject to clinical trials to assess compliance with good clinical practice regulations; and

20


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin and is required to be updated annually. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Our first IND submitted in 2011 relates to Amphora for the prevention of pregnancy (AMP001). Our second IND relates to our BV product candidate (EVO-002). We have also been allowed to conduct a clinical trial relating to prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea (AMPREVENCE) under this second IND, and the first subject was enrolled in this trial in December 2017.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. The trial protocol and informed consent information for trial subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each institution where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the trial until completion; an IRB may halt a trial under its jurisdiction for safety reasons. Trial subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must be accompanied by payment of a significant user fee to the FDA, and establishment and product fees are payable annually after a drug’s approval. Section 505(b)(1) and Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA are the provisions governing the type of NDAs that may be submitted under the FDCA. Section 505(b)(1) is the traditional pathway for new chemical entities when no other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, has been approved by the FDA. As an alternate pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. During the sixty days after submission, the FDA reviews any NDA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before the FDA accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the NDA for filing. Even if the NDA is filed by the FDA, companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
The FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or may condition the approval of an NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Post-Approval Requirements
Oftentimes, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical trials. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations after approval. Certain changes to the product, its manufacturing, or its labeling also require the NDA holder to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA and, in many cases, to receive prior approval from FDA before implementing the proposed changes. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities. This latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including withdrawal of the product from the market.
Hatch-Waxman Act
As part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendment, Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA was enacted. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant 
21

has not obtained a right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional trials or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
To the extent the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on trials conducted for an already approved product, which is referred to as the Listed Drug, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any listed patents in the FDA’s Orange Book publication that relate to the Listed Drug. Specifically, the applicant must certify for all listed patents one of the following certifications: (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a specified date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. 
If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the 505(b)(2) application. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the Listed Drug has expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the Listed Drug’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders for the Listed Drug once the applicant’s NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA by imposing a 30-month automatic statutory injunction, which may be shortened by the court in a pending patent case if either party fails to reasonably cooperate in expediting the case. The 30-month stay terminates if a court issues a final order determining that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the applicant’s NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay.
Other Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA has indicated that Amphora is covered by the PREA, but the FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of an applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. We requested and were granted a partial waiver for pre-menarcheal females and all pediatric males, as these populations are not at risk of pregnancy. Extrapolation of efficacy and safety data based on data in adult populations is planned for pediatric post-menarcheal females (≤17 years).
If we establish international operations, we will be subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the FCPA), which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements involving exclusive license rights, if any, or acquisitions, if any, may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
22

We are currently assessing how Amphora is going to be regulated in the EU and expect that Amphora is going to be regulated as a drug. Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
To obtain marketing approval of a drug in the EU, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in specific EU member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any EU member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for an applicant to apply to one-member state to assess the application (the reference member state) and specifically list other member states in which it wishes to obtain approval (concerned member states). Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labelling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and each concerned member state. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application which is then reviewed and approved commented on by the concerned member states. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
In the EU, only products for which marketing authorizations have been granted may be promoted. Even if authorized, prescription-only medicines may only be promoted to healthcare professionals, not the general public. All promotion should be in accordance with the particulars listed in the summary of product characteristics. Promotional materials must also comply with various laws, and codes of conduct developed by pharmaceutical industry bodies in the EU which govern (amongst other things) the training of sales staff, promotional claims and their justification, comparative advertising, misleading advertising, endorsements, and (where permitted) advertising to the general public. Failure to comply with these requirements could lead to the imposition of penalties by the competent authorities of the EU member states. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the medical device, seizure of promotional materials, fines and possible imprisonment.

Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the day we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million, measured as of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act of 2012 herein as the “JOBS Act,” and references herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 As long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of one or more of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
