 Overview
  
  We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing new generation medicines to treat diseases and disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) with high unmet need. Our portfolio of three clinical-stage product candidates is currently focused on major depressive disorder (MDD), neuropathic pain (NP), levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and suicidal ideation (SI).
  
  Our most advanced product candidate, PH94B neuroactive nasal spray, is fundamentally different from all current treatments for SAD. Developed from proprietary compounds called pherines and administered as a nasal spray, PH94B activates nasal chemosensory receptors that trigger neural circuits in the brain that suppress fear and anxiety. In a published, peer-reviewed, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial undertaken in a laboratory setting mimicking public speaking and social interaction challenges, PH94B neuroactive nasal spray was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing behavior related to social anxiety in individuals with SAD. Its novel mechanism of pharmacological action, rapid-onset of therapeutic effects and exceptional safety and tolerability profile in clinical trials to date make PH94B neuroactive nasal spray an excellent product candidate with potential to become the first FDA-approved on-demand treatment for SAD. Additional potential indications for PH94B include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD), as well as other neuropsychiatric indications.
  
  AV-101 (4-Cl-KYN), one of our two product candidates initially focused on MDD, belongs to a new generation of investigational medicines in neuropsychiatry and neurology known as NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) glutamate receptor modulators. The NMDA receptor is a pivotal receptor in the brain and abnormal NMDA function is associated with multiple CNS diseases and disorders, including MDD, epilepsy, LID, NP and many others. AV-101 is an oral prodrug of 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), which binds uniquely at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor and has potential to be a new at-home treatment for MDD and other CNS indications with high unmet need. AV-101 is currently in Phase 2 development in the U.S. for MDD. ELEVATE is our Phase 2 multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AV-101 as an add-on treatment for MDD in adult patients with an inadequate therapeutic response to current FDA-approved oral antidepressants (ADs) (the ELEVATE Study). Dr. Maurizio Fava, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director, Division of Clinical Research, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Research Institute, is the Principal Investigator of the ELEVATE Study, assisting our internal team, which is led by Mark Smith, MD, PhD, our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Fava was the co-Principal Investigator with Dr. A. John Rush of the STAR*D study, the largest clinical trial conducted in depression to date, whose findings were published in journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). We currently anticipate top line results from the ELEVATE Study in the second half of 2019. In addition to MDD, we believe preclinical data and positive safety data in all clinical studies to date support AV-101’s potential to treat LID, NP and SI, The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for development of AV-101 both as a potential add-on treatment of MDD and as a non-opioid treatment for NP.
  
  Our other product candidate in Phase 2 development and initially focused on MDD is PH10 neuroactive nasal spray. PH10 is a potential first-in-class, CNS neurosteroid nasal spray administered in microgram doses for front-line treatment of MDD. PH10 nasal spray activates nasal chemosensory receptors that, in turn, engage GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) neurons in the limbic amygdala system. The activation of these neural circuits is believed to have the potential to lead to rapid antidepressant effects without psychological side effects, systemic exposure or safety concerns often associated with current antidepressants. Based on positive results from a small exploratory Phase 2a study in MDD in which rapid-onset antidepressant effects were observed without psychological side effects or systemic exposure, we are planning for Phase 2b clinical development of PH10 as a first-line treatment for MDD in the second half of 2020.
  
  In addition to our CNS business, we have two pipeline-enabling programs through our wholly-owned subsidiary, VistaStem Therapeutics (VistaStem). VistaStem is focused on applying pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technology to discover, rescue, develop and commercialize proprietary new chemical entities (NCEs) for CNS and other diseases and regenerative medicine (RM) involving hPSC-derived blood, cartilage, heart and liver cells. Our internal drug rescue programs are designed to utilize CardioSafe 3D, our customized stem cell technology-based cardiac bioassay system, to discover and develop small molecule NCEs for our CNS pipeline or for out-licensing. To advance potential RM applications of our cardiac stem cell technology, we have sublicensed to BlueRock Therapeutics LP, a next generation cell therapy and RM company established by Bayer AG and Versant Ventures (BlueRock Therapeutics), rights to certain proprietary technologies relating to the production of cardiac stem cells for the treatment of heart disease (the BlueRock Agreement). In a manner similar to the BlueRock Agreement, we may pursue additional collaborations or licensing transactions involving blood, cartilage, and/or liver cells derived from hPSCs for cell-based therapy, cell repair therapy, RM and/or tissue engineering.

  PH94B Neuroactive Nasal Spray for SAD
 
 SAD, a social phobia that affects as many as 15 million Americans according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), is characterized by an intense and persistent fear of embarrassment, evaluation, humiliation, judgment, and rejection in everyday social or performance situations, leading the individual to avoid anxiety and fear-producing social situations when possible, even if such avoidance is detrimental to the individual’s employment, social activities and overall quality of life. SAD is commonly treated chronically with ADs, which have slow onset of effect (several weeks or months) and known side effects that may make them unattractive to individuals intermittently or episodically affected by SAD. Benzodiazepines, also known as benzos, and beta blockers, which are prescribed off-label to treat SAD, have been found in third party literature to have addictive or sedative properties, and have other adverse effects when used to treat SAD.
 
 PH94B neuroactive nasal spray is a synthetic investigational neurosteroid with a novel, rapid-onset mechanism of action that is fundamentally different from all current treatments for SAD. Developed from proprietary compounds called pherines and administered at microgram doses as an odorless nasal spray, PH94B activates nasal chemosensory receptors that trigger neural circuits in the brain that suppress fear and anxiety. Specifically, PH94B engages nasal chemosensory receptors that trigger a subset of neurons in the main olfactory bulbs (OB). OB neurons then stimulate inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the limbic amygdala, releasing anxiolytic neuropeptide S, decreasing release of norepinephrine, and facilitating fear extinction activity of the limbic-hypothalamic parasympathetic system.
 
 In a 91-patient published, peer-reviewed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial, which included both laboratory-based public speaking and social situation challenges, PH94B, administered as a nasal spray at a microgram dose, significantly improved the primary efficacy endpoint, as assessed using subjective anxiety ratings on the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), within 10 to 15 minutes of self-administration, without systemic exposure. It was not observed to be addictive, sedative or have other adverse events. In a 22-patient, four-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot Phase 3 crossover study, subjects receiving PH94B had a significantly greater decrease in average peak SUDS scores compared to placebo within one week of treatment.  There was also a significantly greater decrease in Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) avoidance scores for subjects who received PH94B first, before crossing over to placebo. These data were presented in a poster session at ADAA’s 2019 Annual Conference. PH94B's safety profile was excellent in all clinical studies to date, without systemic exposure and with no serious adverse events. 
 
 We acquired PH94B in September 2018 on a non-cash basis through the issuance of unregistered shares of our common stock under a license from Pherin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Pherin) giving us the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize PH94B. With its novel mechanism of pharmacological action, rapid-onset of therapeutic effects and exceptional safety and tolerability profile shown in clinical trials to date, we believe PH94B neuroactive nasal spray is an excellent product candidate with potential to become the first FDA-approved, on-demand, as-needed treatment for SAD. We are currently preparing for the initial pivotal Phase 3 study of PH94B as a first-line on-demand treatment for SAD. Subject to securing sufficient financing, we currently plan to begin this initial pivotal Phase 3 study in the first half of 2020.
  
  AV-101 for MDD
  
 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, affecting over 300 million people, or approximately 4.4% of the global population. Statistics from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) indicate that an estimated 17.3 million adults in the U.S., or approximately 7.1% of all adults in the U.S., had at least one major depressive episode in 2017. While most people will experience depressed mood at some point during their lifetime, MDD is different. In typical depressive episodes, the person experiences depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to diminished activity and impaired daily functioning for at least two weeks and often much longer. Symptoms of MDD also may include diminished pleasure in activities, changes in appetite that result in weight changes, insomnia or oversleeping, psychomotor agitation, loss of energy or increased fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions, and thoughts of death or suicide and attempts at suicide. MDD is the psychiatric diagnosis most commonly associated with suicide.

 For many people, depression cannot be controlled for any length of time without treatment. Current oral ADs available in the multi-billion-dollar global depression market, including commonly-prescribed oral SSRIs and SNRIs, have modest efficacy, substantial lag of onset of action, and considerable side effects. Approximately two out of every three depression sufferers do not receive adequate therapeutic benefits from their initial treatment with a standard AD, and the likelihood of achieving remission of depressive symptoms declines with each successive AD treatment attempt. Even after multiple treatment attempts, approximately one-third of depression sufferers still fail to find an adequately effective AD. In addition, this trial and error process and the systemic effects of the various ADs involved may increase the risk of patient tolerability issues and serious side effects, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors in certain groups. New generation ADs with different mechanisms of action, faster onset activity and fewer side effects are needed.
  
  Convincing clinical data involving the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, and its isomer, esketamine, support that the NMDAR complex is involved in improving depressive symptoms faster than current ADs. Ketamine-based therapies block the ion channel of the NMDAR, and this blockade is associated with significant psychological side effects and safety concerns.
  
 AV-101 (4-Cl-KYN) is an orally-available investigational prodrug of 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), a potent and selective full antagonist of the glycine site of the NMDAR. AV-101’s mechanism of action is fundamentally different from all current oral ADs. In preclinical models, after oral administration, AV-101 is actively transported across the blood-brain barrier and converted into 7-Cl-KYNA in the brain, primarily in astrocytes and predominantly by kynurenine aminotransferase II, the major enzyme responsible for the levels of kynurenic acid that can be rapidly mobilized in the brain. Although 7-Cl-KYNA is a full antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDAR, it does not block the ion channel of the NMDAR. Instead, 7-Cl-KYNA is an allosteric antagonist and down-regulates the NMDAR, which, in part, accounts for AV-101’s exceptional safety profile and lack of psychological side effects and safety concerns.
  
 In clinical and nonclinical testing, AV-101 has good oral bioavailability, an excellent pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and is not an inhibitor or inducer of the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. No binding of AV-101 or 7-Cl-KYNA to off-site targets was identified by an extensive receptor screening. Moreover, in all clinical trials to date, AV-101 has been safe and very well-tolerated with no psychological side effects or safety concerns, and no treatment-related serious adverse events that are often observed with classic channel-blocking NMDAR antagonists such as ketamine and amantadine. We are conducting our ELEVATE Study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AV-101 as an add-on treatment of MDD in adult patients with an inadequate response to standard, FDA-approved oral ADs s. We currently anticipate that we will be able to report top line results of the ELEVATE Study during the second half of 2019. The Principal Investigator of the ELEVATE Study is Dr. Maurizio Fava of Harvard Medical School. Dr. Fava was the co-Principal Investigator with Dr. A. John Rush of the largest clinical trial ever conducted in depression, STAR*D, whose findings were published in journals such the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association. In published preclinical studies, AV-101 has been shown to have rapid, persistent, AMPA-dependent antidepressive effects similar to ketamine controls. Recent nonclinical results also indicate that chronic administration of 4-Cl-KYN induces hippocampal neurogenesis, a hallmark of drugs that have antidepressive effects, and increases endogenous levels of KYNA, which also is a functional NMDAR glycine site antagonist.
  
 The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for development of AV-101 as an add-on treatment for MDD in adult patients with an inadequate response to standard, FDA-approved ADs.
  
 We believe the potential for widespread and long-term use of ketamine-based therapies for MDD may be limited by the potential for abuse, dissociative and other psychological side effects and by the inconvenience and practical challenges associated with required administration in a clinical setting. In the event that the cost, side effects, safety concerns, required in-clinic administration or other factors limit the use of ketamine-based therapies and result in relapse of MDD and/or suicidal ideation, we believe AV-101 has potential to prevent relapse of MDD and/or suicidal ideation without ketamine-like side effects and safety concerns, when administered orally to ketamine therapy responders, on an at-home basis, following cessation of ketamine-based therapy. In May 2019, we announced top line results from the NIMH’s small, exploratory Phase 2 clinical study of AV-101 as a monotherapy (given alone) in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), a disease characterized by serious, long-lasting episodes of depression. The average length of the current depressive episode of the 19 TRD patients that completed the NIMH study was 8.6 years. Prior to participating in the NIMH study, patients had undergone an average of 7.8 attempts to treat their TRD over their lifetime, using multiple different antidepressant drugs. In this severe treatment resistant population, AV-101 given alone, as a monotherapy, did not demonstrate significant separation from placebo on the primary outcome measure, the change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score compared to placebo. A key objective of the NIMH study was to evaluate safety and tolerability of AV-101 in TRD patients, and, consistent with our Phase 1 studies, AV-101 was very well-tolerated with no ketamine-like psychological side effects or safety concerns and no treatment-related serious adverse events. In sharp contrast to the NIMH monotherapy study in severe TRD patients, our ELEVATE Study is intended to evaluate AV-101 as an adjunctive therapy (as add-on treatment given with a current oral AD) in patients experiencing less severe depression. We plan to leverage our ELEVATE Study Investigational New Drug application (IND) to conduct an exploratory Phase 2 study to assess the efficacy and safety of AV-101 as an add-on treatment with standard ADs to prevent relapse of MDD following successful ketamine-based therapy.

  PH10 Neuroactive Nasal Spray for MDD
 
 PH10 neuroactive nasal spray is a synthetic investigational neurosteroid with a novel, rapid-onset mechanism of action that is fundamentally different from all current treatments for MDD. Developed from proprietary compounds called pherines and administered at microgram doses as an odorless nasal spray, PH10 activates nasal chemosensory receptors that trigger neural circuits in the brain that produce antidepressant effects. Specifically, PH94B engages nasal chemosensory receptors that trigger a subset of neurons in the main OB. OB neurons then stimulate neurons in the limbic amygdala that release norepinephrine and increase activity of the limbic-hypothalamic sympathetic nervous system.
 
 In an exploratory 30-patient Phase 2a clinical trial, PH10 was well-tolerated and, at microgram doses, demonstrated rapid-onset antidepressant effects, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), without systemic psychological side effects or safety concerns. PH10 is a new generation antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is fundamentally different from AV-101 and all current ADs. As with AV-101, we believe PH10 has potential for multiple applications in global depression markets, initially as a stand-alone front line therapy for MDD, and as both an add-on therapy to augment current FDA-approved ADs for patients with MDD who have an inadequate response to standard ADs, and to prevent relapse following successful treatment with ketamine-based therapy.
  
 We acquired PH10 from Pherin in October 2018, on a non-cash basis through the issuance of unregistered shares of our common stock. Under our license, we have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize PH10. We are currently planning for Phase 2b development of PH10 as a first-line treatment for MDD. Subject to securing sufficient financing, we plan to submit our IND for a Phase 2b study of PH10 in MDD in the second half of 2020, and, if authorized by the FDA, begin the study in the second half of 2020.
  
  Additional Potential Clinical Development Programs
  
  Suicidal Ideation
  
 According to the WHO, every year approximately 800,000 people worldwide take their own life and many more attempt suicide. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) views suicide as a major public health concern in the U.S. as rates of suicide have been increasing for both men and women and across all age groups. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S. and is one of just three leading causes that are on the rise. According to experts in the field of suicidal ideation (SI), characterized as suicidal thoughts and behavior, the number of Americans who die by suicide is, since 2010, higher than those who die in motor vehicle accidents. People of all genders, ages, and ethnicities can be at risk for suicide. Suicidal ideation is complex and there is no single cause. The NIMH attributes many different factors to someone making a suicide attempt, including, but not limited to, depression, other mental health disorders or substance abuse. Additionally, according to reports released by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the U.S. Military Veteran population is at significantly higher risk for suicide than the general population.
  
 We are collaborating with Baylor College of Medicine (Baylor) and the VA on a small Phase 1b clinical trial of AV-101 in healthy volunteer U.S. Military Veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation New Dawn (the Baylor Study). The Baylor Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study designed as a target engagement study as the first-step in our plans to test potential anti-suicidal effects of AV-101 in U.S. Military Veterans who respond to ketamine-based therapy. Dr. Marijn Lijffijt of Baylor is the Principal Investigator of the Baylor Study. In June 2018, we entered into a Material Transfer Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (MT CRADA) with the VA regarding clinical trial material for the Baylor Study. Government funding from the VA is being provided for substantially all other study costs.
  
  Neuropathic Pain
  
  NP affects approximately 33 million people in the United States (excluding patients with back pain) according to an article published in the Journal of Pain Research in 2017. NP is a complex, chronic pain state characterized by a steady burning "pins and needles" or "electric shock" sensation that results in abnormal neuronal function after nerve damage. The American Chronic Pain Association has identified various causes of NP, including tissue injury, nerve damage or disease, diabetes, infection, toxins, certain types of drugs, such as antivirals and chemotherapeutic agents, certain cancers, and even chronic alcohol intake. Current treatments for NP include antidepressants, anticonvulsants (such as gabapentin and pregabalin), and opioids, among others. However, current medications may offer inadequate efficacy, have limiting side effects, and be associated with abuse.

 The effects of AV-101 as a potential new treatment for NP were assessed in published peer-reviewed preclinical studies involving four well-established models of pain. In these studies, AV-101 was observed to have robust, dose-dependent anti-nociceptive effects, as measured by dose-dependent reversal of NP in the Chung (nerve ligation), formalin and carrageenan thermal models in rats, and was well-tolerated. The publication, titled: “Characterization of the effects of L-4-chlorokynurenine on nociception in rodents,” by lead author, Tony L. Yaksh, Ph.D., Professor in Anesthesiology at the University of California, San Diego, was published in The Journal of Pain in April 2017 (J Pain. 18:1184-1196, 2017)). In recent studies in this preclinical model, AV-101 also had positive results using pregabalin (Lyrica®2) as an active control. AV-101 demonstrated robust analgesic effects, similar to Lyrica, but fewer side effects as measured in the rotarod assay. Neurontin and Lyrica have been associated with sedation and mild cognitive impairment in third party literature and are often prescribed for treatment of NP. Other commonly prescribed medications for NP include drugs targeting opioid receptors in the brain. Unfortunately, misuse of such drugs can lead to a significantly increased risk of addiction, and, we believe, their therapeutic utility for neuropathic pain is unclear.
  
 Based on successful preclinical studies involving AV-101, gabapentin and pregabalin, as well as AV-101’s exceptional safety profile in all preclinical and clinical studies to date, we are exploring the optimal development path forward, subject to securing sufficient capital, for Phase 2a clinical development of AV-101 as a new generation, non-opioid treatment to reduce debilitating NP, as well as its potential to avoid sedative side effects and cognitive impairment that have been observed in third party literature to be associated with other NP treatments, and to reduce the risk of addiction associated with pain medications targeting opioid receptors.
  
 The FDA has granted Fast Track designation for development of AV-101 as a potential new, non-opioid treatment of NP.
  
  Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia
  
  Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting approximately one million people in the U.S., according to the Parkinson’s Foundation. Although there is no "one-size-fits-all” description of PD, PD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that occurs when brain cells responsible for making dopamine, a chemical that coordinates movement, stop working or die. This results in progressive deterioration of voluntary motor control. Loss of dopamine neurons is thought to be due to neurotoxicity associated with misfolding of proteins and is associated with increased signaling of glutamate, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Increased glutamate activity is involved with aberrant neuronal signaling and excitotoxic death of neurons. Classic PD motor symptoms include muscular rigidity, resting tremor, and postural and gait impairment. Typically, PD patients present with a combination of motor and non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms may include cognitive impairment, sleep disorders pain and fatigue. There is currently no medication to slow, delay, stop or cure PD, and currently available treatments are symptomatic. Treatment of motor symptoms with oral levodopa, introduced about 50 years ago, remains the gold standard treatment.
  
  Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a disorder that affects people with PD who are treated with levodopa, for an extended period of time. Oral levodopa remains the most effective therapy for motor symptoms of PD. However, after continuous long-term use (longer than five years), many PD patients experience LID. Although clinical manifestations of LID are heterogenous, LID is commonly associated with abnormal involuntary movements, including chorea and dystonia. These motor complications tend to become more severe as PD progresses and as the duration of levodopa treatment is extended, until the impact of LID may compromise the advantage of treatment with levodopa. PD treatment with levodopa is routinely delayed due to concerns over LID. Once LID develops, levodopa-treated PD patients may be faced with a choice between immobility due to untreated and uncontrolled PD, or mobility with the associated LID. Studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Movement Disorders have shown LID develops in approximately 45% of levodopa-treated Parkinson’s disease patients after five years and 80% after 10 years of levodopa treatment. In the U.S., there are an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people with PD who are impacted by LID.
  
  AV-101 is not a dopamine-based drug candidate. Rather, as a member of a new generation of investigational medicines in neuropsychiatry and neurology known as NMDA glutamate receptor modulators, AV-101’s active metabolite, 7-Cl-KYNA, is a potent and selective NMDA receptor glycine site antagonist with neuroprotective properties, which receptor plays a major role in glutamatergic signaling and has been shown to be a therapeutic target for LID.
  
 In a recently reported preclinical study in the “gold standard” MPTP monkey model of PD and LID, AV-101’s efficacy against LID was measured through behavioral scores on a dyskinesia scale, and a Parkinsonian disability scale was used to measure levodopa anti-parkinsonian efficacy. This study demonstrated that AV-101 significantly (p = 0.01) reduced LID. Importantly, AV-101 did not reduce the timing, extent, or duration of the therapeutic effects of levodopa, indicating that AV-101 did not impact the anti-parkinsonian efficacy of levodopa. Moreover, AV-101 did not cause adverse events often associated with amantadine therapy for LID, such as hallucinations, dizziness, and falls. These recent preclinical results confirm our prior antidyskinesia study in this MPTP monkey model. We believe these preclinical data and AV-101’s positive safety profile in all clinical studies to date support AV-101’s potential to treat LID, while both maintaining the antiparkinsonian benefits of levodopa and without causing hallucinations or other serious side effects that may be associated with amantadine therapy for LID. As a result, we are exploring the optimal development path forward, subject to securing sufficient capital, for Phase 2a clinical development of AV-101 as a new generation treatment for LID.

  General Anxiety Disorder
  
 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a common chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by persistent, debilitating and excessive concern and worry about family, friends, health, money, work, or other everyday issues and situations. Individuals with GAD find it difficult to control their worry and may worry more about actual circumstances than seems appropriate. They may also expect the worst even when there is no apparent reason to do so. GAD is diagnosed when an individual is unable or finds it difficult to control worry on more days than not for at least six months and has three or more of the many symptoms of GAD, such as excessive and ongoing worrying and tension, an unrealistic view of problems, restlessness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, or being easily startled. This differentiates GAD from worry that may be specific to a set stressor or for a more limited period of time. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association, GAD affects approximately 6.8 million adults in the U.S. in any given year. GAD comes on gradually and can begin across the life cycle, though the risk is highest between childhood and middle age.
  
 People with GAD do not know how to stop the worry cycle and feel it is beyond their control, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants. Many individuals with GAD may avoid situations because they have the disorder or they may not take advantage of important professional or social opportunities in their lives due to their anxiety and worry. When their anxiety is severe, it is difficult for individuals with GAD to carry out even the simplest of daily activities. Currently, the standard of care for GAD includes psychotherapy and certain medications with limited therapeutic benefits and various side effects and safety concerns, including antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs) and benzodiazepines.
  
 PH94B demonstrated efficacy in a small placebo-controlled study in patients with GAD. Twenty one patients were randomized to receive 200 pg PH94B or placebo in a one second aerosol pulse to the chemosensory epithelium of the anterior nasal septum. Thirty minutes after treatment there was mean reduction of 32.0% for the PH94B group and 19.6% for the placebo group in the total HAM-A score. Electrophysiological changes (respiratory, cardiac, and electrodermal frequency), concordant with the reduction in anxiety, were significantly greater for the PH94B group. We believe these transient anti-anxiety effects of PH94B may warrant further investigation in a Phase 2b GAD trial.
  
  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
  
  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinically diagnosed psychiatric disorder that develops in some people who have experienced or witnessed a shocking, scary, dangerous or life-threatening event, such as military combat, natural disasters, terrorist incidents, serious accidents, or physical or sexual assault in adulthood or childhood. Symptoms of PTSD include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, uncontrollable intrusive thoughts, and emotional numbing after the event. More than 8 million people in the U.S. suffer from PTSD. Anyone can develop PTSD at any age. According to the National Center for PTSD, about 7 or 8 out of every 100 people will experience PTSD at some point in their lives. PTSD is often accompanied by depression, substance abuse or one or more of the other anxiety disorders.
 
  It is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. Fear triggers many split-second changes in the body to help defend against danger or to avoid it. This “fight-or-flight” response is a typical reaction meant to protect a person from harm. Because PTSD is associated with a heightened “fight or flight” response mediated by increased sympathetic nervous response to conditioned stimuli, an agent which decreases sympathetic tone may be able to treat some symptoms of PTSD. Our PH94B neuroactive nasal spray is a neurosteroid that binds to chemosensory cells in the olfactory bulb and indirectly decreases amygdala function, reduces stress-induced blood pressure, heart rate and sweating mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. In Phase 2 studies, at microgram doses, PH94B has been shown to have anti-anxiety effects in patients with both generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. PH94B may therefore have utility either as monotherapy or as add-on therapy in PTSD. Available therapeutic options for PTSD are limited, including only two FDA-approved SSRI antidepressants, which have limited efficacy, undesirable side effects, and target only the symptoms of PTSD, not the underlying disorder itself. We are currently assessing PH94B’s potential for Phase 2a clinical development as a new generation, rapid-acting, anxiolytic for treatment of PTSD.
 
  Epilepsy
  
 Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, affecting almost 1% of the worldwide population. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, as many as three million Americans have epilepsy, and one-third of those suffering from epilepsy are not effectively treated with currently available medications. In addition, standard anticonvulsants can cause significant side effects, which frequently interfere with compliance.
  
 Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that is also critically involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Through its stimulation of the NMDAR subtype, glutamate has been implicated in the neuropathology and clinical symptoms of the disease. In support of this, NMDAR antagonists are potent anticonvulsants. However, as noted, classic ion channel-blocking NMDAR antagonists are limited by adverse effects, such as neurotoxicity, declining mental status, and the onset of psychotic symptoms following administration of the drug. The endogenous amino acid glycine modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission by stimulating the glycine coagonist site of the NMDAR. Glycine site antagonists such as AV-101’s active metabolite, 7-Cl-KYNA, inhibit NMDAR function and are therefore anticonvulsant and neuroprotective. Importantly, glycine site antagonists have fewer and less severe side effects than classic ion channel-blocking NMDAR antagonists and other antiepileptic agents, making them a safer potential alternative to, and one expected to be associated with greater patient compliance than, currently available anticonvulsant medications.
  
 In addition, another active metabolite of AV-101, 4-Cl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, inhibits the synthesis of quinolinic acid (QUIN), which is an endogenous NMDAR agonist that causes convulsions and excitotoxic neuronal damage.
  
 AV-101 has been shown to protect against seizures and neuronal damage in preclinical animal models of epilepsy. We believe AV-101’s dual action as a NMDAR GlyB antagonist and QUIN synthesis inhibitor, and exploratory preclinical data, together with human safety data in all clinical studies to date, may provide support for AV-101’s potential as a Phase 2a clinical development candidate for treatment of epilepsy. As a result, subject to securing sufficient capital, we anticipate conducting additional preclinical studies in 2020 to assess AV-101’s optimal development path forward and potential for future Phase 2a clinical development as a new generation treatment for epilepsy.
  
  VistaStem Therapeutics - Stem Cell Technology-Based Programs
  
 Stem cells are the building blocks of all cells of the human body.  They have the potential to develop into many different mature cell types. Stem cells are defined by a minimum of two key characteristics: (i) their capacity to self-renew, or divide in a way that results in more stem cells; and (ii) their capacity to differentiate, or turn into mature, specialized cells that make up tissues and organs. There are many different types of stem cells that come from different places in the body or are formed at different times throughout our lives, including pluripotent stem cells and adult or tissue-specific stem cells, which are limited to differentiating into the specific cell types of the tissues in which they reside. We focus exclusively on hPSCs, which can be differentiated into all of the more than 200 types of cells in the human body, can be expanded readily, and have diverse medical research, drug discovery, drug rescue (DR), drug development and therapeutic applications. We believe hPSCs can be used to develop numerous cell types, tissues and customized assays that can mimic complex human biology, including heart biology for DR applications.
  
  VistaStem Therapeutics (VistaStem) is our wholly owned subsidiary focused on applying our hPSC technology to discover, rescue, develop and commercialize proprietary new chemical entities (NCEs) for our CNS pipeline and cellular therapies and RM involving hPSC-derived blood, cartilage, heart and liver cells. We used our hPSC-derived human heart cells to develop CardioSafe 3D™, our customized in vitro bioassay system for predicting heart toxicity of potential DR NCEs.  We believe CardioSafe 3D is more comprehensive and clinically predictive than the hERG assay and provides us with new generation human cell-based technology to identify and evaluate DR candidates and develop DR NCEs for our CNS pipeline and/or out-licensing.

  Drug Rescue
 
 Our DR activities are focused on producing, for our internal CNS pipeline or out-licensing, novel, proprietary and safer variants of still-promising NCEs previously discovered, optimized and tested for efficacy by pharmaceutical companies and others but terminated before FDA approval due to unexpected heart toxicity. Our DR strategy involves using CardioSafe 3D to assess the cardiac toxicity that caused certain NCEs available in the public domain to be terminated, and then produce and develop new, potentially safer, and proprietary NCEs. We believe the pre-existing public domain knowledge base supporting the therapeutic and commercial potential of NCEs that we target for our DR programs will provide us with a valuable head start as we launch each of our potential DR programs. The essential components of our DR strategy are to (i) leverage the substantial prior investments by global pharmaceutical companies and others in discovery, optimization and efficacy validation of the NCEs we identify in the public domain and (ii) use CardioSafe 3D to enhance our understanding of the cardiac liability profile of such NCEs, insight not previously available when the NCEs were originally discovered, optimized for efficacy and developed by others, and (iii) demonstrate preclinical proof-of-concept (POC) as to the efficacy and safety of new, safer DR NCEs in standard in vitro and in vivo models earlier in development and with substantially less investment in discovery and preclinical development than was required of others prior to their decision to terminate the original NCE. In this context, POC means that the lead DR NCE, as compared to the original previously-terminated original NCE, demonstrates both (i) equal or superior efficacy in the same, or a similar, in vitro and in vivo preclinical efficacy models used by the initial developer of the previously-terminated NCE before it was terminated for cardiac safety reasons, and (ii) significant reduction of concentration dependent cardiotoxicity in CardioSafe 3D.
 Regenerative Medicine
  
 Stem cell technology-based cell therapy (CT) and RM have the potential to transform healthcare by providing new approaches for treating the fundamental mechanisms of disease. We currently intend to establish strategic CT- and/or RM-focused collaborations to leverage our hPSC technology platform, our expertise in human biology, differentiation of hPSCs to develop functional adult human cells and tissues involved in human disease, including blood, bone, cartilage, heart and liver cells for CT and RM purposes. We have exclusively sublicensed to BlueRock Therapeutics, a next generation RM company established by Bayer AG and Versant Ventures, rights to certain proprietary technologies relating to the production of cardiac stem cells for the treatment of heart disease. In a manner similar to our agreement with BlueRock Therapeutics, we may pursue additional CT and RM collaborations or licensing transactions involving blood, cartilage, and/or liver cells derived from hPSCs for CT and RM applications. 
 Intellectual Property
  
 We strive to protect the proprietary know-how and technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and related pharmaceutical compositions, their methods of use, including therapeutic and prognostic methods, as well as processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of our discoveries and inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.
  
 We may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
  
 To protect our rights to our proprietary technology, we require all employees, as well as our external collaborators, consultants and CROs when feasible, to enter into agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants, and CROs in the course of their service to us.
  
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of use, including treatment and patient selection, formulations and manufacturing processes created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates.

  Patent Term
  
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring and related patent.
  
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, if any, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA (testing phase), plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application (approval phase). This patent term restoration period may be reduced by the FDA if it finds that applicant did not act with due diligence during the testing phase or the approval phase. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if circumstances permit, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our then owned or licensed patents, if any, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
  
 Some of our products may also be entitled to certain non-patent-related data exclusivity under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA may not be submitted by another company for another drug containing the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA Orange Book by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a full NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. Three-year exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications that rely on the information that served as the basis of granting three-year exclusivity. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations, and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
  
 Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, also have patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products, their methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture.
  
  Trade Secrets
  
 In addition to patents, we may rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect trade secrets, if any, and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all relevant inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.

  Trademarks
  
 The Company also owns a registered trademark in the U.S. for “VISTAGEN,” which was renewed in 2014. In addition, we use trademarks in our business for CardioSafe 3D and LiverSafe 3D.
 Strategic Transactions and Relationships
  
 Strategic collaborations are an important cornerstone of our corporate development strategy. We believe that our highly selective outsourcing of certain research, development, manufacturing and regulatory activities gives us flexible access to a broad range of capabilities and expertise at a lower overall cost than developing and maintaining such capabilities and expertise internally on a full-time basis. In particular, we contract with third parties for certain manufacturing, nonclinical development, clinical development and regulatory affairs support. We may seek multiple additional strategic collaborations and relationships focused on development and commercialization of our product candidates in regions outside the U.S.
 Manufacturing and Supply
    
 We neither own nor operate, and currently have no plans to own or operate, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our clinical and nonclinical material supply through third party contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs). If our product candidates are approved, we intend to contract with CDMOs to produce all of our future commercial supplies on our behalf.
    
 We have established relationships with CMOs under which the CMOs manufacture clinical and nonclinical supplies of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), as well as drug product, for AV-101, PH94B and PH10 on a purchase order basis. When produced, all clinical supplies are certified by our CDMOs to have been manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Starting materials and key intermediates to support the production of these candidates are either manufactured by other qualified suppliers or purchased from chemical suppliers. We do not currently have arrangements in place for either long-term supply or redundant supply of bulk drug substance or drug product for AV-101, PH94B and PH10. Our CMOs manufacture such product candidates on a purchase order basis under master service and quality agreements. We intend to put a long-term commercial supply agreement in place at the appropriate time for drug substance and drug product for each product candidate, if development continues. We plan to mitigate potential commercial supply risks for any products that are approved in the future through inventory management and through exploring additional back-up manufacturers to provide API and/or drug product.
    
 We continue to refine and scale up the manufacturing process for PH94B to supply our Phase 3 clinical trials, and for AV-101 and PH10 to supply future clinical and nonclinical studies. We believe we currently have sufficient AV-101 drug substance on hand for our ongoing ELEVATE Study and the ongoing Baylor/VA Study.
    
 AV-101, PH94B and PH10 are small molecule drugs. The current syntheses of AV-101, PH94B and PH10 are reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials. On-going development work is in progress to ensure that these synthetic routes are cost-effective , robust and amenable to large-scale manufacturing. We expect to continue to identify and develop drug candidates that are amenable to cost-effective manufacturing at contract manufacturing facilities.

 Sales and Marketing
  
 We believe that we can successfully launch and commercialize PH94B on our own in the U.S., if approved by the FDA, through the hiring of a targeted sales and marketing force. If an NDA for PH94B in the treatment of SAD is approved by the FDA following our Phase 3 clinical development program, we anticipate hiring and deploying a field sales force of key account managers calling on hospitals and specialty representatives calling on healthcare professionals who treat SAD. We expect to focus our future sales and marketing efforts, if PH94B is approved for SAD, on psychiatrists and select primary care physicians and potentially on pediatricians who are likely to see adolescents, as well as nurse practitioners and psychologists who, in some states, are permitted to prescribe medications.
  
 Should we advance AV-101 and PH10 through successful completion of Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development for treatment of MDD and/or other CNS indications, we plan to file for and obtain regulatory approval of AV-101 and PH10 in the U.S. and then commercialize them in the U.S., either on our own or with a collaborator.
  
 To develop and commercialize one or more our product candidates in pharmaceutical markets outside the U.S., if approved in such markets, we may decide to establish agreements or alliances with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators and/or distributors. Currently, in China, the EU, Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea, we plan to develop and commercialize our product candidates with third-party collaborators with successful operations involving development and/or commercialization of CNS products, especially neuropsychiatry products. We anticipate that such collaborations would involve local clinical development, regulatory submissions comparable to those required by the FDA in the U.S. and commercial activities necessary to monetize our product candidates. We may also consider other partnering opportunities if we believe the partnering opportunity will add significant value to our efforts, including through local capabilities and infrastructure, as well as speed to market and financial contributions, in each case depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the expected development pathway and related costs, deal terms, our available resources, and whether the transaction makes strategic sense.
    
  Competition
  
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large and growing markets for SAD, MDD, NP, LID, and other CNS diseases and disorders make them attractive therapeutic areas for biopharmaceutical businesses. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Several of these entities have commercial products, robust drug pipelines, readily available capital, and established research and development organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of branded and generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
  
 Although currently there are no FDA-approved therapies for SAD with the mechanism of action of PH94B, we are aware of two companies with development programs potentially focused on SAD. However, neither of those companies is developing a potential treatment for SAD that is either a nasal spray or involves the same mechanism of pharmacological action as PH94B.
  
 Although currently there are no FDA-approved oral therapies for MDD with the mechanism of pharmacological action of either AV-101 or PH10, we are aware of numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are developing therapies targeting the MDD market, including with drug candidates focused on the NMDAR. Certain of the potential MDD therapies being developed are broad NMDAR antagonists and tend to have multiple target actions. We believe AV-101 is an NMDAR glycine site antagonist and is modulatory, without negative off-target activity in preclinical screening. We are aware of the numerous companies developing or commercializing therapies for MDD or NMDAR-targeted therapies for other CNS disorders. Such companies include but are not limited to, Acadia, Adamas, Alkermes, Allergan, Aptynix, Avanir, Axsome, Biohaven, BlackThorn, Cadent, Cerecor, Eli Lilly, , Janssen, Lundbeck, Minerva, Navitor, NeuroRx, Otsuka, Novartis, Perceptive Neuroscience, Relmada, Sage, Seelos, Shionogi, Taisho and Takeda. Additionally, we expect that AV-101 and PH10 will have to compete with a variety of therapeutic procedures for treatment of MDD, such as psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy.

 While we believe that our employees and consultants, scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments.  
  
 We believe that VistaStem’s hPSC technology platform, the hPSC-derived human cells we produce, and the customized human cell-based assay systems we have formulated and developed are capable of being competitive in the diverse and growing global stem cell, CT and RM markets, including potential markets involving the sale of hPSC-derived cells to third-parties for their in vitro drug discovery and safety testing, contract predictive toxicology drug screening services for third parties, internal drug discovery, drug development and DR of new NCEs, and RM, including in vivo CT research and development. A representative list of such biopharmaceutical companies pursuing one or more of these potential applications of adult and/or hPSC technology includes, but is not limited to, the following: Acea, Astellas, Athersys, BioCardia, BioTime, Caladrius, Cellectis, Cellerant, Cytori, Fujifilm, HemoGenix, International Stem Cell, Neuralstem, Organovo, PluriStem, and Stemina BioMarker Discovery. Pharmaceutical companies and other established corporations such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Charles River, GE Healthcare, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche Holdings, Thermo Fisher and others have been and are expected to continue pursuing internally various stem cell-related research and development programs. Many of the foregoing companies have greater resources and capital availability and as a result, may be more successful in their research and development programs than us. We anticipate that acceptance and use of hPSC technology for drug development, CT and RM will continue to occur and increase at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the future.

  Government Regulation
  
 Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring/pharmacovigilance, safety and periodic reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed in a given jurisdiction, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained and/or generated, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and the drug must be approved by the relevant regulatory authority or authorities.
 U.S. Drug Development
  
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject a company to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold on a clinical investigation, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
  
 Each of our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and generally involves the following:
  
   ●
 Completion of extensive non-clinical studies and testing, sometimes referred to as non-clinical laboratory tests, non-clinical animal studies and formulation studies, in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) regulations;

 
   ●
 Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

 
   ●
 Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;

 
   ●
 Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes collectively referred to as good clinical practice (cGCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;

 
   ●
 Submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval of a new drug;

 
   ●
 A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept and file the NDA for review; Satisfactory completion of a potential FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;

 
   ●
 Potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and

 
   ●
 Payment of applicable user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.

 
 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For NCEs, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal laws and regulations, including, for animal studies, the Animal Welfare Act and cGLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND.
  
 
   
-14-



 
 

 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocols for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including whether subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non- compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
  
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or to patients with the disease or condition being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any given clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols describing, among other details, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants, and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
  
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with cGCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and compliance with informed consent principles, and FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
  
  Clinical Trials
  
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
  
   ●
 Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.

 
   ●
 Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy.

 
   ●
 Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (typically from several hundred to several thousand subjects), and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended for drugs intended for chronic dosing to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.

 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, increased rates of serious suspected adverse events, or findings from other studies or from animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Success in one phase does not mean similar results will be observed in subsequent phases. Each phase may involve multiple studies. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial, and may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, we must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
  
  NDA and FDA Review Process
  
 The results of nonclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the U.S.
  
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) the FDA may also issue a Written Request asking a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies related to a particular active moiety; if the sponsor agrees and meets certain requirements, the sponsor may be eligible to receive additional marketing exclusivity for its drug product containing such active moiety.
  
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee, unless subject to a waiver. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is approximately $2.6 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee for human drugs of approximately $0.3 million. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan-designated indication.
  
 
   
-16-



 
 

 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to complete its initial review of an NDA and respond to the applicant within 10 months from the filing date for a standard NDA and, and within six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
  
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and integrity of the data submitted in the NDA. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. For example, the advisory committee may recommend or the FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigtion Strategy (REMS) program is necessary to ensure safe use of the product. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation process for an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
  
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or one or more additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such additional data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
  
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve any of our drug product candidates for marketing in the U.S., and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the FDA review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific patient populations and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA typically requires that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, and may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and/or efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if the FDA determines that a REMS is required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any limitations on approval, marketing or use for any of our products could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of those products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
  
  Orphan Drug Designation
  
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA for the drug for the proposed rare disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the common name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not, by itself, convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
  
 
   
-17-



 
 

 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other sponsors’ applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity operates independently from other regulatory exclusivities and other protection against generic competition, including patents that we hold for our products. A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation may also be granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, the FDA may coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval on the basis of more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population.
  
 Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. The FDA can revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet patient needs. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits.
  
  Expedited Development and Review Programs
  
 The FDA has several programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation are two of these programs and apply to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the development of the product and may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy based on preliminary clinical evidence which meet the criteria outlined in the FDA’s programs. Under the Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy expedited programs, the FDA may review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
  
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval.
  
 Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and offers a significant improvement in the safety and effectiveness of treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. Significant improvement may be shown by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months from the date of the NDA filing.
  
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if the product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening illness and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Accelerated approval for a product means that it may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as:
  
   ●
 distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or

   
   ●
 distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures.

 
 The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
  
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.

  Pediatric Trials
  
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from non-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA, if it learns of new information, may also request that the sponsor amend the initial PSP.
 Post-marketing Requirements
  
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as off-label use), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the Internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (the PDMA) and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).
  
 FDA regulations also require that approved products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
  
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, administrative enforcement, warning or untitled letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.

  Other Regulatory Matters
  
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Department of Health and Human Services; the Department of Justice; the DEA; the Consumer Product Safety Commission; the Federal Trade Commission; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the Environmental Protection Agency; and state and local governments.
  
 In the U.S., a drug product approved by the FDA may also be subject to regulation under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as a controlled substance. The CSA is administered by the DEA and establishes, among other things, certain registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements for controlled substances. The CSA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V. FDA approved pharmaceutical products may be listed in Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. An approved drug product or drug candidate that has not yet been approved by the FDA may be subject to scheduling as a controlled substance under the CSA, depending on the drug’s potential for abuse. For a drug approved by the FDA and determined to require control under the CSA, the CSA requires the DEA to issue an interim final order scheduling the drug within 90 days after the FDA approves the drug and the DEA receives a scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services, after it has been completed by FDA. We do not expect FDA to recommend scheduling of any of our product candidates as a controlled substance, if approved.
  
 In the U.S., arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third-party payors, patients and others will expose us to broadly applicable anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and other health care laws and regulations. These broadly applicable laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements or relationships through which we sell, market and distribute our products, if and when we obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., federal and state health care laws and regulations that may affect our operations include:
  
   ●
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a company marketing a prescription drug (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual or purchase, lease or order, or the arranging for or recommending the purchase or order, of a particular item or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors, or speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, damages, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

 
   ●
 The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the federal government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities. The government may deem companies to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation may include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties for each separate false or fraudulent claim, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.

   ●
 Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability, private litigation, or adverse publicity. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties, such as hospitals, healthcare professionals, and research institutions from which we or our collaborators obtain patient health information, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HIPAA). Although we are not directly subject to the HIPAA information privacy and security provisions, other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we or our agents knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, HIPAA does not replace federal, state, or other laws that may grant individuals even greater privacy protections.

 
   ●
 The HIPAA fraud provisions, which impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

 
   ●
 The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.

 
   ●
 Analogous state and local laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payer. We also may become subject to other state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws and local ordinances that require identification or licensing of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.Substantial resources are necessary to ensure that our business arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third party payors, patients and others comply with applicable health care laws and regulations. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law, and if we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.

 
 Numerous other laws may apply to our products. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to herein as ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
  
 
   
-21-



 
 

 The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act.
  
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record- keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
  
 Changes in statutes, regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 
  European Union Drug Development
  
 We plan to develop and commercialize our product candidates in the EU, either alone or with a collaborator. As in the U.S., in the EU, our future products also will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a Marketing Authorization (MA) from the competent regulatory authorities in the EU has been obtained.
  
 Similar to the U.S., the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive in a manner that is often not uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. The EU legislator has, therefore, adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the EU Clinical Trials Regulation. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which will replace the EU Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to start to apply in late-2019 or in 2020.
   
 Clinical trials in the EU must currently be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and applicable good clinical practice standards, as implemented into national legislation by EU Member States. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
  
 In the EU, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) or waiver, is required to have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) prior to submission of a MA application to the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States. In most EU countries, we are also required to have an approved PIP before we can begin enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial.
  
  European Union Drug Review and Approval and Post-marketing Requirements
  
 In the European Economic Area (EEA) (which is comprised of 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related MA has been granted. A MA for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These are through a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (single EU Member State). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the EMA. If a related positive opinion is provided by the EMA, the European Commission will grant a centralized MA that is valid in all EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Associations (EFTA) countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).
  
 The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients in the EU.
  
 The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. The competent authorities of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances, the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies (CMDh) for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States.

 The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application in the EU is 210 days, not including clock stops during which applicants respond to questions from the competent authority. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
  
 The holder of an EU MA for a medicinal product must also comply with the EU’s pharmacovigilance legislation. This includes requirements to conduct pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products.
  
 Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products. Manufacture of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization. The manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and APIs, including the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU with the intention to import the APIs into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. MA holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
  
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Breaches of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of medicinal products to the general public and may also impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 
  European Union New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
  
 In the EU, innovative medicinal products that are subject to marketing authorization on the basis of a full dossier and do not fall within the scope of the concept of global marketing authorization, which prevents the same marketing authorization holder or members of the same group from obtaining separate data and market exclusivity periods for medicinal products that contain the same active substance, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. However, the generic product or biosimilar products cannot be marketed in the EU for a further two years thereafter. The overall ten-year period may be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
  
 In the EU, orphan drug designations are granted by the European Commission based on a scientific opinion by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products in relation to medicinal products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union and in relation to which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product.
  
 Orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of exclusivity in all EU Member States and a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the product. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is deemed safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
  
 In addition, grant of orphan designation by the European Commission also entitles the holder of this designation to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not, in itself, convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and authorization process.

  Rest of the World Regulation
  
 For other countries outside of the U.S. and the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from countr- to-country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
  
 Approval by a regulatory authority in one jurisdiction does not guarantee approval by comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements applicable to a given country, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in such country if we choose to seek such approval, or we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
  
  Coverage and Reimbursement
  
  U.S. Healthcare Reform
  
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Changes in government legislation or regulation and changes in private third-party payors’ policies toward reimbursement for our products, if successfully developed and approved, may reduce reimbursement of our products’ costs to physicians, pharmacies, patients, and distributors. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results for products, if any, we commercialize in the future.
  
 The pricing and reimbursement environment for our products may change in the future and become more challenging due to, among other reasons, policies advanced by the Trump Administration, federal agencies, new healthcare legislation passed by Congress or fiscal challenges faced by all levels of government health administration authorities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), for example, allocated new federal funding to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same condition. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although ARRA does not mandate the use of the results of comparative effectiveness studies for reimbursement purposes, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any products for which we receive marketing approval or on the reimbursement policies of public and private payors. It is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any product for which we receive marketing approval. For example, if third-party payors find our products not to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.

 The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges, and the expansion of the Medicaid program. This law has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, benefits for patients within a coverage gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the donut hole), rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, expansion of the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program, or 340B program, fraud and abuse and enforcement. These changes have impacted previously existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
  
 One of the goals of ACA was to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid. The ACA also imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or ownership interest that is not timely, accurately, or completely reported (annual maximum of $150,000), and $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (annual maximum of $1 million). The reporting requirements apply only to manufacturers of products for which reimbursement is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
  
 Some states have elected not to expand their Medicaid programs by raising the income limit to 133% of the federal poverty level, as is permitted under the ACA. For each state that does not choose to expand its Medicaid program, there may be fewer insured patients overall, which could impact sales of our approved products that are approved and that we successfully commercialize, and our business and financial condition. Where Medicaid patients receive insurance coverage under any of the new options made available through the ACA, the possibility exists that manufacturers may be required to pay Medicaid rebates on drugs used under these circumstances, a decision that could impact manufacturer revenues. In addition, there have been delays in the implementation of key provisions of the ACA, including the excise tax on generous employer-based health insurance plans. The implications of these delays for business and financial condition, if any, are not yet clear.
  
 Moreover, additional legislative changes to or regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible. The Trump Administration has identified repeal and replacement of the ACA as one of its priorities, and has altered the implementation of the ACA and related laws. In this regard, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law in December 2017, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” The nature and extent of any additional legislative changes to the ACA are uncertain at this time. In addition, in December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the ACA unconstitutional in its entirety because once Congress repealed the “individual mandate” provision as part of tax reform legislation enacted in late 2017, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. The court reasoned that the “individual mandate” was not severable from the rest of the ACA and found the entire Act was an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional authority. While the Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. We expect that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved.
  
 Other legislative changes relating to reimbursement have been adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services under Part A and B, including drugs and biologicals, and most payments to plans under Medicare Part D were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, or BCA, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The BCA requires sequestration for most federal programs, excluding Medicaid, Social Security, and certain other programs. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction to 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. As long as these cuts remain in effect, they could adversely impact payment for any products we may commercialize in the future. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.

  Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
  
 If we are successful in developing and gaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, sales of our products will be dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product for which we received marketing approval could reduce physician usage of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they use through Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs, as well as through commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the U.S. no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
  
 If we are successful in developing and gaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs impose obligations to report pricing figures to the federal government, meaning that we would be subject to these price reporting and other compliance obligations. Other programs impose limits on the price we will be permitted to charge certain entities for our products, if any, for which we receive regulatory approval. Statutory and regulatory changes or other agency action regarding these programs and their requirements could negatively affect the coverage and reimbursement by these programs of products for which we receive regulatory approval and could negatively impact our results of operations.
  
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program was established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and amended by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 as well as subsequent legislation. If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we will be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the state for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates will be based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), previously known as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These data will include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug, which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts, and other price concessions. The ACA made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the ACA. Our failure to comply with these price reporting and rebate payment options could negatively impact our financial results.
  
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing discount program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA, requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The ACA expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid Drug Rebate amount under the ACA or otherwise also could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations.
  
 HRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the new regulation. HRSA also is implementing a ceiling price reporting requirement related to the 340B program during the first quarter of 2019, pursuant to which we are required to report our 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis. Implementation of the civil monetary penalties regulation and the issuance of any other final regulations and guidance could affect our obligations under the 340B program in ways we cannot anticipate. In addition, legislation may be introduced that, if passed, would further expand the 340B program to additional covered entities or would require participating manufacturers to agree to provide 340B discounted pricing on drugs used in the inpatient setting.

 Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program report average sales price information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. Statutory or regulatory changes or CMS guidance could affect the average sales price calculations for our approved products that we successfully commercialize and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact our results of operations. Also, the Medicare Part B drug payment methodology is subject to change based on potential demonstration projects undertaken by CMS or potential legislation enacted by Congress.
  
 Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount will be computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current average manufacturer prices and best prices for the quarter. If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed 12 quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B drug pricing program.
  
 If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and consequently the 340B drug pricing program, we could be held liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. Civil monetary penalties can be applied if we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our average sales price, or if we are found to have charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price or best price information to the government, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties per item of false information. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price and best price data on a timely basis could result in a significant civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we will participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, no federal payments would be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs.
  
 CMS and the Office of the Inspector General have pursued manufacturers that were alleged to have failed to report these data to the government in a timely manner. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. If we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and consequently the 340B drug pricing program, we cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect.
  
 In order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Defense (DoD), Public Health Service, and Coast Guard (the Big Four agencies) and certain federal grantees, we will be required to participate in the VA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing program, established under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, we will be obligated to make our “covered” drugs (i.e., innovator drugs and biologics) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to the Big Four agencies that is no higher than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is a price calculated pursuant to a statutory formula. The FCP is derived from a calculated price point called the “non-federal average manufacturer price” (Non-FAMP), which we will be required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS contract also contains extensive disclosure and certification requirements. In addition, Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, will require us to pay quarterly rebates to DoD on utilization of covered drugs that are dispensed through DoD’s Tricare network pharmacies to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP for the calendar year that the product was dispensed. If we overcharge the government in connection with the FSS contract or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Rebate Program, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we will be required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and any response to government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU Member States have the power to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States, and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
  
 In various EU Member States, we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including countries representing major markets. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technologies assessment. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that EU Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States. However, this consequence cannot be excluded.
  
  Stem Cell Technology - United States
  
 With respect to our stem cell research and development in the U.S., the U.S. government has established requirements and procedures relating to the isolation and derivation of certain stem cell lines and the availability of federal funds for research and development programs involving those lines. All of the stem cell lines that we are using were either isolated under procedures that meet U.S. government requirements and are approved for funding from the U.S. government, or were isolated under procedures that meet U.S. government requirements.
  
 All procedures we use to obtain clinical samples, and the procedures we use to isolate hESCs, are consistent with the informed consent and ethical guidelines promulgated by the U.S. National Academy of Science, the International Society of Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), or the NIH. These procedures and documentation have been reviewed by an external Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee, and all cell lines we use have been approved under one or more of these guidelines.
  
 The U.S. government and its agencies on July 7, 2009 published guidelines for the ethical derivation of hESCs required for receiving federal funding for hESC research. Should we seek further NIH funding for our stem cell research and development, our request would involve the use of hESC lines that meet the NIH guidelines for NIH funding. In the U.S., the President’s Council on Bioethics monitors stem cell research, and may make recommendations from time to time that could place restrictions on the scope of research using human embryonic or fetal tissue. Although numerous states in the U.S. are considering, or have in place, legislation relating to stem cell research, it is not yet clear what affect, if any, state actions may have on our ability to commercialize stem cell technologies.

  Corporate History
  
  VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc., a California corporation incorporated on May 26, 1998, dba VistaStem, is our wholly-owned subsidiary. Excaliber Enterprises, Ltd. (Excaliber), a publicly-held company (formerly OTCBB: EXCA) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 6, 2005. Pursuant to a strategic merger transaction on May 11, 2011, Excaliber acquired all outstanding shares of VistaStem in exchange for 341,823 shares of our common stock and assumed all of VistaStem’s pre-Merger obligations (the Merger). Shortly after the Merger, Excaliber’s name was changed to “VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc.” (a Nevada corporation).
  
  VistaStem, as the accounting acquirer in the Merger, recorded the Merger as the issuance of common stock for the net monetary assets of Excaliber, accompanied by a recapitalization.  The accounting treatment for the Merger was identical to that resulting from a reverse acquisition, except that we recorded no goodwill or other intangible assets. A total of 78,450 shares of our common stock, representing the shares held by stockholders of Excaliber immediately prior to the Merger are reflected as outstanding for all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the $0.001 par value of Excaliber’s common stock.
  
  The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report represent the activity of VistaStem from May 26, 1998, and the consolidated activity of VistaStem and Excaliber (now VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation), from May 11, 2011 (the date of the Merger) through March 31, 2019. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of VistaStem’s two inactive wholly-owned subsidiaries, Artemis Neuroscience, Inc., a Maryland corporation (Artemis), and VistaStem Canada, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Ontario, Canada (VistaStem Canada).

Five full-time employees work in research and development and laboratory support services and four full-time employees work in general and administrative roles.
