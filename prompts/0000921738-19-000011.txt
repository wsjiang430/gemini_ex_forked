ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Penn National Gaming, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a leading, diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and racing facilities and video gaming terminal (“VGT”) operations with a focus on slot machine entertainment. In the second half of 2018, we launched live sports wagering at our facilities in Mississippi, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In addition, the Company operates an interactive gaming division through its subsidiary, Penn Interactive Ventures, LLC (“PIV”). As of December 31, 2018, we owned, managed, or had ownership interests in 40 facilities in 18 jurisdictions. The majority of the gaming facilities used in the Company’s operations are subject to triple net master leases; the most significant of which are the Penn Master Lease and the Pinnacle Master Lease (as such terms are defined in the “Master Leases” section below and collectively referred to as the “Master Leases”), with Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”), a publicly-traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”), as the landlord under the Master Leases. GLPI was formed in November 2013 through a tax-free spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) in which the Company separated its gaming operating assets from its real estate assets. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “Penn” and “Penn National” refer to Penn National Gaming, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
In October 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (“Pinnacle”), a leading regional gaming operator (the “Pinnacle Acquisition”). In conjunction with the Pinnacle Acquisition, the Company divested the membership interests of certain Pinnacle subsidiaries which operated the casinos known as Ameristar Casino Resort St. Charles, Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City, Belterra Casino Resort and Belterra Park (referred to collectively as the “Divested Properties”), to Boyd Gaming Corporation (“Boyd”). Additionally, as a part of the transaction, (i) GLPI acquired the real estate associated with Plainridge Park Casino, and concurrently leased back the real estate assets to the Company (the “Plainridge Park Casino Sale-Leaseback”) and (ii) a subsidiary of Boyd acquired the real estate assets associated with Belterra Park from a subsidiary of GLPI. In connection with the sale of the Divested Properties to Boyd as well as the Plainridge Park Casino Sale-Leaseback, the Pinnacle Master Lease, which was assumed by the Company concurrent with the closing of the Pinnacle Acquisition, was amended. The Pinnacle Acquisition added twelve gaming properties to our holdings and provides us with greater operational scale and geographic diversity.
In November 2018, we announced that the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the operations of Greektown Casino-Hotel in Detroit, Michigan, subject to a triple net lease with VICI Properties, Inc. (“VICI”), a publicly-traded REIT, which we expect to close in the second quarter 2019. In January 2019, we acquired Margaritaville Casino Resort subject to a triple net lease with VICI (the “Margaritaville Lease”). Further, we have planned two development projects in Pennsylvania: Hollywood Casino York and Hollywood Casino Morgantown (a greenfield project), which are both Category 4 satellite gaming facilities. We anticipate that both of these development projects will be complete within 12-18 months after obtaining the necessary local and regulatory approvals.
In May 2017, we completed the acquisitions of 1st Jackpot Casino Tunica (f/k/a Bally’s Casino Tunica) and Resorts Casino Tunica. In June 2015, we opened Plainridge Park Casino, an integrated racing and slots-only gaming facility in Plainville, Massachusetts, and in August 2015, we completed the acquisition of our first Las Vegas strip asset, Tropicana Las Vegas. In September 2015, we acquired Illinois Gaming Investors LLC (d/b/a Prairie State Gaming) (“Prairie State Gaming”), one of the largest VGT route operators in Illinois, which has since acquired four small VGT route-operators based in Illinois. In 2015, PIV launched our HollywoodCasino.com Play4Fun social gaming platform with Scientific Games Corporation, and in August 2016, we enhanced our social gaming offerings with the acquisition of Rocket Speed, Inc. (“Rocket Speed”), a leading developer of social casino games.
We believe that our portfolio of assets provides us the benefit of a geographically diversified cash flow from operations. We expect to continue to expand our gaming operations through the implementation and execution of a disciplined capital expenditure program at our existing properties, the pursuit of strategic acquisitions, and the development of new gaming properties. In addition, we expect to pursue opportunities within other distribution channels, such as retail gaming, social gaming, and real money iGaming.

Master Leases
As noted above, the majority of the gaming facilities used in the Company’s operations are subject to either the Penn Master Lease or the Pinnacle Master Lease. Under triple net master leases, in addition to lease payments for the real estate assets (i.e., land and buildings), the Company is required to pay the following, among other things: (1) all facility maintenance; (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (4) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties.
The following summaries of the Master Leases are qualified in their entirety by reference to either the Penn Master Lease or the Pinnacle Master Lease, as applicable, and subsequent amendments, all of which are attached hereto as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Penn Master Lease
Pursuant to a triple net master lease with GLPI (the “Penn Master Lease”), which became effective November 1, 2013, the Company leases real estate assets associated with 20 of the gaming facilities used in its operations. We determined that the Penn Master Lease did not meet the requirements of a normal leaseback under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 840 “Leases” due to prohibited forms of continuing involvement; and is, therefore, accounted for as a financing obligation.
The Penn Master Lease has an initial term of 15 years with four subsequent, five-year renewal periods on the same terms and conditions, exercisable at the Company’s option. If we elect to renew the term of the Penn Master Lease, the renewal will be effective as to all of the leased property then subject to the Penn Master Lease, provided that the final renewal option shall only be exercisable with respect to certain of the barge-based facilities (i.e., facilities where barges serve as foundations upon which buildings are constructed to serve as gaming or related facilities or serve ancillary purposes such as access platforms or shear barges to protect a gaming facility from floating debris) following an independent third party expert’s review of the total useful life of the applicable barged-based facility measured from the beginning of the initial term. If the final five-year renewal term would not cause the aggregate term to exceed 80% of the useful life of such facility, the facility shall be included in the five-year renewal. In the event that a five-year renewal of such facility would cause it to exceed 80% of the estimated useful life, such facility shall be included in the renewal for the period of time equal to but not exceeding 80% of the estimated useful life.
The payment structure under the Penn Master Lease includes a fixed component, a portion of which is subject to an annual escalator of up to 2%, depending on the Adjusted Revenue to Rent Ratio (as defined in the Penn Master Lease) of 1.8:1, and a component that is based on the performance of the facilities, which is prospectively adjusted (i) every five years by an amount equal to 4% of the average change in net revenues of all facilities under the Penn Master Lease compared to a contractual baseline (other than Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo) during the preceding five years (“Penn Percentage Rent”) and (ii) monthly by an amount equal to 20% of the net revenues of Hollywood Casino Columbus and Hollywood Casino Toledo in excess of a contractual baseline. Additionally, effective November 1, 2018, the percentage rent reset resulted in an annual rent reduction of $11.3 million, which will be in effect until the Company’s next percentage rent reset occurring on November 1, 2023.
In April 2014, we entered into an amendment to the Penn Master Lease in order to revise certain provisions relating to our Sioux City property. In accordance with that amendment, upon the cessation of gaming operations at Argosy Casino Sioux City on July 30, 2014, due to the termination of its gaming license, the annual payment to GLPI was reduced by $6.2 million. In addition, with the openings of Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course in September 2014, our annual payment increased by $19 million, which approximated 10% of the real estate construction costs paid for by GLPI related to these facilities.
In May 2017, following the acquisitions of 1st Jackpot Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica, we entered into an amendment to the Penn Master Lease in order to add the two additional facilities. The Company operates both 1st Jackpot Casino Tunica and Resorts Casino Tunica and leases the underlying real estate assets associated with these two properties from GLPI with a total initial annual payment of $9.0 million subject to the provisions included in the terms of the Penn Master Lease.
We do not have the ability to terminate our obligations under the Penn Master Lease prior to its expiration without GLPI’s consent. If the Penn Master Lease is terminated prior to its expiration other than with GLPI’s consent, we may be liable for damages and incur charges such as continued lease payments through the end of the lease term and maintenance costs for the leased property.
 2

Pinnacle Master Lease
In connection with the Pinnacle Acquisition, the Company assumed a triple net master lease with GLPI, originally effective April 28, 2016 (“Pinnacle Master Lease”). Concurrent with the closing of the Pinnacle Acquisition on October 15, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the Pinnacle Master Lease to, among other things, (i) remove Ameristar Casino Resort St. Charles, Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City and Belterra Casino Resort, which were sold to Boyd, and (ii) add Plainridge Park Casino, whose real estate assets were sold to GLPI for $250.0 million and concurrently leased back to the Company for a fixed annual rent of $25.0 million. Further, the rent payment under the Pinnacle Master Lease was increased by a fixed annual amount of $13.9 million to adjust the rent to reflect current market conditions. Pursuant to the Pinnacle Master Lease, the Company leases real estate assets associated with twelve of the gaming facilities used in its operations from GLPI. Similar to the Penn Master Lease, the Pinnacle Master Lease is accounted for as a financing obligation.
Upon assumption of the Pinnacle Master Lease, as amended, there were 7.5 years remaining of the initial 10-year term, with five subsequent, five-year renewal periods exercisable at the Company’s option. The payment structure under the Pinnacle Master Lease includes a fixed component, which is subject to an annual escalator of up to 2%, depending on the Adjusted Revenue to Rent Ratio (as defined in the Pinnacle Master Lease) of 1.8:1, and a component that is based on the performance of the facilities, which is prospectively adjusted every two years by an amount equal to 4% of the average change in net revenues of all facilities under the Pinnacle Master Lease compared to a contractual baseline during the preceding two years (“Pinnacle Percentage Rent”). The next Pinnacle Percentage Rent reset will occur effective May 1, 2020.
We do not have the ability to terminate our obligations under the Pinnacle Master Lease prior to its expiration without GLPI’s consent. If the Pinnacle Master Lease is terminated prior to its expiration other than with GLPI’s consent, we may be liable for damages and incur charges such as continued lease payments through the end of the lease term and maintenance costs for the leased property.

Competition
The gaming industry is characterized by an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including riverboat casinos; dockside casinos; land-based casinos; video lottery; internet gaming; sports betting; gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois; gaming at truck stop establishments in certain states, such as Pennsylvania and Louisiana; sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos; the potential for increased fantasy sports; real money iGaming; Native American gaming; and other forms of gaming in the U.S. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; athletic events; television and movies; concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have facilities, have legalized, implemented and expanded gaming. In addition, established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations (including VGTs, sports betting and iGaming). New, relocated or expanded operations by other companies will increase competition for our gaming operations and could have a material adverse impact on us. Finally, the imposition of smoking restrictions and/or higher gaming tax rates have a significant impact on our properties’ ability to compete with facilities in nearby jurisdictions. 
Northeast.  Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by competition in the Baltimore, Maryland market, which includes Maryland Live! and Horseshoe Casino Baltimore. Maryland Live!, a casino complex at the Arundel Mills mall in Anne Arundel, Maryland, opened in June 2012 and Horseshoe Casino Baltimore opened at the end of August 2014. Both of these facilities are substantial in nature, as Maryland Live! has approximately 4,000 slot machines, over 200 table games, various food and beverage offerings and as of July 2018, a 300-room hotel, whereas Horseshoe Baltimore has 2,200 slot machines and 180 table games. In December 2013, the sixth casino license for Maryland in Prince George’s County was granted to MGM. In December 2016, MGM National Harbor casino and resort opened featuring 3,300 slot machines and 124 table games and has had an adverse impact our financial results, as it has created additional competition for Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races.
In November 2011, the Expanded Gaming Act was signed into law in Massachusetts, which allows up to three destination resort casinos located in three geographically diverse regions across the state and a single slots facility for one location statewide. In February 2014, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission awarded us the slots-only gaming license and in June 2015, we opened Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville. The licenses for two of three casino resorts have been awarded, with the remaining license in Southeastern Massachusetts still open. MGM Springfield in Western Massachusetts opened in August 2018 and Encore Boston Harbor in Eastern Massachusetts is scheduled to open in June 2019. Construction of a tribal casino in Taunton, Massachusetts, which was expected to open in 2017, is currently on hold following a judicial opinion issued during the third quarter 2016 regarding the validity of the Tribe’s land in trust. In addition, the relocation of the Newport Casino license to Tiverton, Rhode Island, near the Massachusetts border, which was approved by local and statewide voters in November 2016, opened in September 2018. Twin River Casino Hotel in Lincoln, Rhode Island, completed its new hotel tower during the fourth quarter 2018. The increased competition in Massachusetts will have a negative impact on the operations of Plainridge Park Casino.
In Ohio, a racino at Scioto Downs in Columbus, Ohio, opened in June 2012, which had a negative impact on Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg’s financial results and competes aggressively in the same market as Hollywood Casino Columbus. In addition, a racino at Miami Valley Gaming opened in December 2013, and a racino at Belterra Park opened in May 2014. Both of these racinos compete with Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg. We have opened our own racinos in Ohio, with Hollywood Gaming at Dayton Raceway in August 2014 and Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course in September 2014. As a 
 9

result, in a relatively short period of time, Ohio has gone from having no gaming facilities to having four casinos and seven VLT facilities. In addition, we continue to fight illegal gaming operations, such as internet sweepstakes, in the state.
In addition, legislators in Kentucky regularly consider new gaming legislation. The commencement of gaming in Kentucky would negatively impact certain of our existing properties in the Northeast segment. In October 2017, Pennsylvania enacted gaming expansion legislation that authorized licenses for up to ten new Category 4 satellite casinos, VGTs at truck stops, online gaming, and other gaming offerings. The new casinos will have the ability to operate between 300 and 750 slot machines and up to 40 table games. Only Pennsylvania’s existing gaming operators were permitted to initially participate in the auctions for these new casinos, with a preference given to the Category 1 and Category 2 license holders in the first and second rounds. On January 10, 2018, Penn was awarded the first Category 4 satellite casino license to be located in York County for a $50.1 million license fee, which will compete with our Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course facility. On January 24, 2018, the second Category 4 satellite casino license was awarded in Derry Township in Westmoreland County and is expected to compete with and may have an adverse impact on Meadows. On February 8, 2018, the third Category 4 satellite casino license was awarded in Lawrence County which is expected to compete with and have an adverse impact on our existing Hollywood Gaming at Mahoning Valley Race Course facility in Youngstown, Ohio. On February 22, 2018 and April 4, 2018, the fourth and fifth, Category 4 satellite casino licenses, respectively, were awarded in Cumberland County and West Cocalico Township in Lancaster County (this was awarded to Penn for a $7.5 million license fee) which are expected to compete with and have an adverse impact on our Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course facility in Grantville, Pennsylvania. Penn also applied for a license to operate online real money gaming in Pennsylvania. Depending on our ability to successfully operate online gaming in Pennsylvania and on how many of the ten satellite casino licenses are ultimately issued, and the final locations and scope of these satellite casinos, as well as the impact of VGTs at truck stops and online gaming offerings, there may be additional negative impacts on our existing facilities in the Northeast segment.
South.  In the Mississippi Gulf Coast market, the Island View Beach Casino opened in June 2018, which has had an adverse effect on the financial results of our Boomtown Biloxi property. In the West Memphis and Tunica market, in January 2019, a planned expansion and renovation of Southland Park with a 55,000 square foot gaming floor, including over 2,000 gaming machines, gaming tables and high-limit room, will have an adverse impact on our casinos in the Tunica market. In addition, in the Lake Charles market, the opening of a full-service competitor in December 2014, Golden Nugget Lake Charles, has provided increased competition to L’Auberge Lake Charles and continues to have an adverse impact on financial results of our casino.
West. M Resort and Tropicana Las Vegas compete directly with other Las Vegas hotels, resorts, and casinos, including those located on the Las Vegas Strip, on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment offered, convention and meeting facilities, shopping and restaurant facilities, theme, and size. In addition, a substantial number of customers are drawn from geographic areas outside of Las Vegas, particularly California and Arizona. Ameristar Blackhawk’s largest competitor, Monarch Casino, is expected to complete a large renovation and expansion by July 2019, including a parking garage and 500-room hotel. 
Midwest.  In Illinois, there have been perennial gaming expansion proposals introduced in the legislature, which we expect to continue. In October 2012, video gambling in Illinois was officially launched with the first locations being allowed to operate VGTs. Currently, there are over 22,000 terminals at numerous locations throughout the state, which has had a negative impact on our casinos near or in Illinois. In September 2015, we purchased Prairie State Gaming, which is a licensed VGT operator in Illinois, whose operations now include more than 1,850 video gaming terminals across a network of 403 bars and retail gaming establishments throughout Illinois. Illinois also continues to discuss the viability of gaming expansion in the state through a potential combination of additional riverboat operations, land-based casinos and slots at racetracks. In addition, legislators in Indiana and Missouri are currently considering VGT legislation. The commencement of gaming in Indiana and Missouri or the expansion of gaming in Illinois would negatively impact certain of our existing properties in the Midwest segment. In November 2018, a tribal casino opened in Omaha, Nebraska, which competes with Ameristar Council Bluffs. In addition, there is a proposal to reopen a race track with slot machines at the Woodlands in Wyandotte County, which could have an adverse effect on the financial results of Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway. On November 6, 2018, voters in St. Louis County approved a ballot referendum that requires Hollywood Casino St. Louis and River City Casino to make at least 50% of their gaming floors smoke free. This smoking restriction could have an adverse impact on our business operations at our casinos in St. Louis County.
 In February 2019, there was new proposed legislation in Indiana to relocate two existing licenses in Buffington Harbor in Gary, Indiana, moving one license to another location in Gary or another municipality in Northwest Indiana, and a second license to Terre Haute outside of Indianapolis. In the event this legislation passes and a casino is developed in Gary or a nearby municipality in Northwest Indiana, this would have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of Ameristar East Chicago, which is located in East Chicago, Indiana.
 10

In addition, the proposed legislation in Indiana includes the acceleration of live dealer table games at existing racinos in Shelbyville and Anderson, Indiana to the summer of 2019, whereas existing law has live dealer table games at the existing racinos starting in the summer of 2021. In the event this legislation passes and live dealer table games at the existing racinos are available in the summer of 2019, this would have a material adverse impact on the results of operations at Hollywood Casino Lawrenceburg, which is located in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.
Government Regulation and Gaming Issues
The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our facilities is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. For a more detailed description of the statutes and regulations to which we are subject, please see Exhibit 99.1, “Government Regulation and Gaming Issues,” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, health care, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive positions of our properties. From time to time, certain development projects may require substantial costs for environmental remediation due to prior use of our development sites. Our project budgets for such a site typically include amounts expected to cover the remediation work required.
