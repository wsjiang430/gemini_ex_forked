ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Business Overview
We are a leading diversified capital manager that invests in and finances residential and commercial assets. Our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and to preserve capital through prudent selection of investments and continuous management of our portfolio. We are a Maryland corporation founded in 1997 that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”). We are externally managed by Annaly Management Company LLC (“Manager”). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NLY.”
We use our capital coupled with borrowed funds to invest primarily in real estate related investments, earning the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities.
Acquisition of MTGE Investment Corp.
As previously disclosed in our filings with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the acquisition of MTGE Investment Corp. (“MTGE” and such acquisition, the “MTGE Acquisition”), an externally managed hybrid mortgage REIT, closed on September 7, 2018 for an aggregate consideration to MTGE common stockholders of $906.2 million, consisting of $455.9 million in equity consideration and $450.3 million in cash consideration. Annaly issued 43.6 million common shares as part of the consideration for the MTGE Acquisition.
Refer to the note titled “Acquisition of MTGE Investment Corp.” located in Item 15. “Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” for additional details.
Investment Groups
Our investment groups are comprised of the following: 

Investment Groups | Description 
Annaly Agency Group | Invests in Agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) collateralized by residential mortgages which are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae.
Annaly Residential Credit Group | Invests in non-Agency residential mortgage assets within the securitized product and residential mortgage loan markets. 
Annaly Commercial Real Estate Group | Originates and invests in commercial mortgage loans, securities and other commercial real estate debt and equity investments. 
Annaly Middle Market Lending Group | Provides debt financing to private equity-backed middle market businesses across the capital structure. 

We have made significant investments in our business as part of the diversification of our investment strategy. Our operating platform has expanded in support of our diversification strategy, and has included investments in systems, infrastructure and personnel. Our operating platform supports our investments in Agency assets as well as residential credit assets, commercial real estate, residential mortgage loans, mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”), and corporate loans. The diversity of our investment alternatives provides us the flexibility to adapt to changes in market conditions and to take advantage of potential resulting opportunities.
We believe that our business objectives are supported by our size and conservative financial posture relative to the industry, the extensive experience of our Manager’s employees, the diversity of our investment strategy, a comprehensive risk management approach, the availability and diversification of financing sources, our corporate structure and our operational efficiencies.
Investment Strategy and Capital Allocation Policy
We seek to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and to preserve capital through prudent selection of investments and continuous management of our portfolio. Under our capital allocation policy, subject to oversight by our board of directors (“Board”), we may allocate our investments within our target asset classes as we determine to be appropriate from time to time.
Our Board may adopt changes to our capital allocation policy and targeted assets at its discretion.
The nature of our assets and our operations are intended to meet our REIT qualification requirements and our exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”).

Our Portfolio and Capital Allocation
Our portfolio composition and capital allocation at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

 | December 31, 2018 | December 31, 2017 
Investment Group | Percentage of Portfolio | CapitalAllocation (1) | Percentage of Portfolio | CapitalAllocation (1)
Residential | | | |

Annaly Commercial Real Estate Group (3) | 5% | 7% | 5% | 8% 
Annaly Middle Market Lending Group | 2% | 11% | 1% | 5% 


(1) | Capital allocation represents the percentage of equity allocated to each category.


(2) | Includes MSRs.


(3) | Includes assets transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles.

Risk Appetite
We maintain a firm-wide risk appetite statement which defines the types and levels of risk we are willing to take in order to achieve our business objectives, and reflects our risk management philosophy. We engage in risk activities based on our core expertise that aim to enhance value for our stockholders. Our activities focus on income generation and capital preservation through proactive portfolio management, supported by a conservative liquidity and leverage posture. 
The risk appetite statement asserts the following key risk parameters to guide our investment management activities:

Risk Parameter | Description 
Portfolio composition | We will maintain a portfolio comprised of target assets approved by our Board and in accordance with our capital allocation policy. 
Leverage | We generally expect to maintain an economic leverage ratio no greater than 10:1. 
Liquidity risk | We will seek to maintain an unencumbered asset portfolio sufficient to meet our liquidity needs even under adverse market conditions. 
Interest rate risk | We will seek to manage interest rate risk to protect the portfolio from adverse rate movements utilizing derivative instruments targeting both income generation and capital preservation.
Credit risk | We will seek to manage credit risk by making investments which conform within our specific investment policy parameters and optimize risk-adjusted returns. 
Capital preservation | We will seek to protect our capital base through disciplined risk management practices. 
Compliance | We will comply with regulatory requirements needed to maintain our REIT status and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. 

Our Board has reviewed and approved the investment and operating policies and strategies that support our risk appetite statement established by our Manager and set forth in this Form 10-K. Our Board has the power to modify or waive these policies and strategies to the extent that our Board, in its discretion, determines that the modification or waiver is in the best interests of our stockholders. Among other factors, market developments which affect our policies and strategies or which change our assessment of the market may cause our Board to revise our policies and strategies.
We may seek to expand our capital base in order to further increase our ability to acquire new and different types of assets when the potential returns from new investments appear attractive relative to the targeted risk-adjusted returns. We may in the future acquire assets or companies by offering our debt or equity securities in exchange for such opportunities.
 Target Assets
Within the confines of the risk appetite statement, we seek to generate the highest risk-adjusted returns on capital invested, after consideration of the following:

• | The amount, nature and variability of anticipated cash flows from the asset across a variety of interest rate, yield, spread, financing cost, credit loss and prepayment scenarios;


• | The liquidity of the asset;


• | The ability to pledge the asset to secure collateralized borrowings;

3

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS


• | When applicable, the credit of the underlying borrower;


• | The costs of financing, hedging and managing the asset;


• | The impact of the asset to our REIT compliance and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act; and


• | The capital requirements associated with the purchase and financing of the asset.

We target the purchase and sale of the assets listed below as part of our investment strategy. Our targeted assets and asset acquisition strategy may change over time as market conditions change and as our business evolves.

Investment Group | Targeted Asset Class | Description 
Annaly Agency Group | Agency mortgage-backed securities | Agency pass-through certificates issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae. Other Agency MBS include collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), interest-only securities and inverse floaters
To-be-announced forward contracts (“TBAs”) | Forward contracts for Agency pass-through certificates 
Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities | Pass-through certificates collateralized by commercial mortgages guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae 
Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSRs”) | Rights to service a pool of residential loans in exchange for a portion of the interest payments made on the loans 
Annaly Residential Credit Group | Residential mortgage loans | Residential mortgage loans that are not guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae 
Residential mortgage-backed securities | Securities collateralized by pools of residential loans that are not guaranteed by one of the Agencies 
Agency or private label credit risk transfer securities (“CRT”) | Risk sharing transactions issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and similarly structured transactions arranged by third party market participants, designed to synthetically transfer mortgage credit risk to private investors
Annaly Commercial Real Estate Group | Commercial mortgage loans | Loans collateralized by commercial real estate properties 
Commercial mortgage-backed securities | Securities collateralized by pools of commercial mortgage loans 
Mezzanine loans | Loans collateralized by commercial real estate properties subordinate to first mortgage loans 
Real property | Commercial real estate properties that generate current cash flow 
Annaly Middle Market Lending Group | First lien middle market loans | Senior secured loans made to middle market companies that are the first to be repaid in the event of a borrower default 
Second lien middle market loans | Senior secured loans to middle market companies that have a junior claim on collateral to those of first lien loans 

We believe that future interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates are very difficult to predict. Therefore, we seek to acquire assets which we believe will provide attractive returns over a broad range of interest rate and prepayment scenarios.
Capital Structure and Financing
Our capital structure is designed to offer an efficient complement of funding sources to generate positive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders while maintaining appropriate liquidity to support our business and meet our financial obligations under periods of market stress. To maintain our desired capital profile, we utilize a mix of debt and equity funding.  Debt funding may include the use of repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, loans, securitizations, participation sold, lines of credit, asset backed lending facilities, corporate bond issuance, convertible bonds, mortgages payable or other liabilities.  Equity capital primarily consists of common and preferred stock.
We finance our Agency mortgage-backed securities and residential credit investments primarily with repurchase agreements.  We also finance certain commercial real estate investments with repurchase agreements. We seek to diversify our exposure and limit concentrations by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. We enter into repurchase agreements with national broker-dealers, commercial banks and other lenders that typically offer this type of financing. We enter into collateralized borrowings with financial institutions meeting internal credit standards and we monitor the financial condition of these institutions on a regular basis. At December 31, 2018, we had $81.1 billion of repurchase agreements outstanding.

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Additionally, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Arcola Securities, Inc. (“Arcola”), provides direct access to bilateral and triparty funding as a FINRA member broker-dealer. As an eligible institution, Arcola also raises funds through the General Collateral Finance Repo service offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”), with FICC acting as the central counterparty. Since its inception in 2008, Arcola has provided us greater depth and diversity of repurchase agreement funding while also limiting our counterparty exposure.
To reduce our liquidity risk we maintain a laddered approach to our repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2018, the weighted average days to maturity was 77 days.
We maintain access to FHLB funding through our captive insurance subsidiary Truman Insurance Company LLC (“Truman”). We finance eligible Agency, residential and commercial investments through the FHLB. While a January 2016 Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) ruling requires captive insurance companies to terminate their FHLB membership, given the length of its membership, Truman has been granted a five year sunset provision whereby its membership is scheduled to expire in February 2021. We believe our business objectives align well with the mission of the FHLB System.  While there can be no assurances that such steps will be taken, we believe it would be appropriate for there to be legislative action to permit Truman and similar captive insurance subsidiaries to retain their membership status beyond the current sunset period.
We utilize diverse funding sources to finance our commercial investments. In addition to FHLB funding, we may utilize bilateral borrowing facilities, securitization funding and, in the case of equity investments in commercial real estate, mortgage financing.
We utilize leverage to enhance the risk-adjusted returns generated for our stockholders. We generally expect to maintain an economic leverage ratio of no greater than 10:1. This ratio varies from time to time based upon various factors, including our management’s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities, our mix of assets, our liquidity position, our level of unused borrowing capacity, the availability of credit, over-collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings and, lastly, our assessment of domestic and international market conditions. Since the financial crisis beginning in 2007, we have maintained an economic leverage ratio below 8:1, which is generally lower than our leverage ratio had been prior to 2007. For purposes of calculating this ratio, our economic leverage ratio is equal to the sum of Recourse Debt, TBA derivative and CMBX notional outstanding and net forward purchases (sales) of investments divided by total equity.
Our target economic leverage ratio is determined under our capital management policy. Should our actual economic leverage ratio increase above the target level, we will consider appropriate actions which may include asset sales, changes in asset mix, reductions in asset purchases  or originations, issuance of capital or other capital enhancing or risk reduction strategies.
The following table presents our leverage, economic leverage and capital ratios as of the periods presented.

 | December 31, 2018 | December 31, 2017
Leverage ratio | 6.3:1 | 5.7:1 
Economic leverage ratio | 7.0:1 | 6.6:1 
Capital ratio | 12.1% | 12.9% 

Operating Platform
We maintain a flexible and scalable operating platform to support the management and maintenance of our diverse asset portfolio. We have invested in our infrastructure to enhance resiliency, efficiency, cybersecurity, and leveragability while also ensuring coverage of our target assets. Our information technology applications span the portfolio life-cycle including pre-trade analysis, trade execution and capture, trade settlement and financing, monitoring, and financial accounting and reporting.
Technology applications also support our control functions including risk, compliance, middle- and back-office functions. We have added breadth to our operating platform to accommodate diverse asset classes and drive automation-based efficiencies. Our business operations include a centralized collateral management function that permits in-house settlement and self-clearing, thereby creating greater control and management of our collateral. Through technology, we have also incorporated exception based processing, critical data assurance and paperless workflows. Our infrastructure investment has driven operating efficiencies while expanding the platform. Routine disaster recovery and penetration testing enhances our systems resiliency, security and recovery of critical systems throughout the computing estate.

Risk Management
Risk is a natural element of our business. Effective risk management is of critical importance to the success of the firm. The objective of our risk management framework is to identify, measure, monitor and control the key risks to which we are subject. Our approach to risk management is comprehensive and has been designed to foster a holistic view of risk. For a full discussion of our risk management process and policies please refer to the section titled “Risk Management” of Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Management Agreement
We have entered into a management agreement with the Manager pursuant to which our management is conducted by the Manager through the authority delegated to it in the Management Agreement and pursuant to the policies established by our Board (the “Externalization”). The Management Agreement was effective as of July 1, 2013 and was amended on November 5, 2014 and amended and restated on April 12, 2016 and August 1, 2018 (the management agreement, as amended and restated, is referred to as the “Management Agreement”).
The Management Agreement’s current term ends on December 31, 2019 and will automatically renew for successive two-year terms unless at least two-thirds of our independent directors or the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock elect to terminate the agreement in their sole discretion and for any or no reason. At any time during the term or any renewal term we may deliver to the Manager written notice of our intention to terminate the Management Agreement upon 365 days notice (such notice, a “Termination Notice”). During any period between the date we deliver a Termination Notice (the “Notice Delivery Date”) and the date designated by us as the date on which the Manager shall cease to provide management services (the “Termination Date”), the Manager shall continue to perform its duties and obligations under the Management Agreement and cooperate with us to execute an orderly transition to a new manager. If we elect to terminate the Management Agreement, we may elect to accelerate the Termination Date to a date that is between seven and 90 days after the Notice Delivery Date. If we do not elect to do so, then the Manager may elect to accelerate the Termination Date to the date that is 90 days after the Notice Delivery Date. If the Termination Date is accelerated (such date, the “Accelerated Termination Date”) by either us or the Manager, we shall pay the Manager an acceleration fee (the “Acceleration Fee”) in an amount equal to the average annual management fee earned by the Manager during the 24-month period immediately preceding such Accelerated Termination Date multiplied by a fraction with a numerator of 365 minus the number of days from the Notice Delivery Date to the Accelerated Termination Date, and a denominator of 365. The Management Agreement also provides that the Manager may terminate the Management Agreement by providing to us prior written notice of its intention to terminate the Management Agreement no less than 365 days prior to the date designated by the Manager on which the Manager would cease to provide services or such earlier date as determined by us in our sole discretion.
Under the Management Agreement, the Manager, subject to the supervision and direction of our Board, is responsible for (i) the selection, purchase and sale of assets for our investment portfolio; (ii) recommending alternative forms of capital raising; (iii) supervising our financing and hedging activities; and (iv) day to day management functions. The Manager also performs such other supervisory and management services and activities relating to our assets and operations as may be appropriate.  In exchange for the management services, we pay the Manager a monthly management fee in an amount equal to 1/12th of 1.05% of our stockholders’ equity (as defined in the Management Agreement), and the Manager is responsible for providing personnel to manage us and paying all compensation and benefit expenses associated with such personnel. We do not pay the Manager any incentive fees. In addition to the management fee, in August 2018, the Company began reimbursing the Manager for the cost of certain legal, tax, accounting and other support and advisory services provided by employees of the Manager to the Company. Such reimbursements are permitted pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement provided the related costs are no greater than those that would be payable to comparable third party providers.
The Management Agreement provides that during the term of the Management Agreement and, in the event of termination of this Agreement by the Manager without cause, for a period of one year following such termination, the Manager will not, without our prior written consent, manage, operate, join, control, participate in, or advise any person other than us without the prior written consent of the Risk Committee of the Board.
The Management Agreement may be amended or modified by agreement between us and the Manager.

ANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
ITEM 1. BUSINESS

At December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had 8 employees and the Manager had 162 employees. For information about the management fee, see the discussion in the “Management Agreement” section.
Regulatory Requirements
We have elected, organized and operated in a manner that qualifies us to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Code”). So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets, other than our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), consists of qualified REIT real estate assets (of the type described in Section 856(c)(5) of the Code).
We regularly monitor our investments and the income from these investments and, to the extent we enter into hedging transactions, we monitor income from our hedging transactions as well, so as to ensure at all times that we maintain our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.
Arcola is a member of FINRA and is subject to regulations of the securities business that include but are not limited to trade practices, use and safekeeping of funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping and conduct of directors, officers and employees. As a self-clearing, registered broker dealer, Arcola is required to maintain minimum net capital by FINRA. Arcola consistently operates with capital in excess of its regulatory capital requirements as defined by SEC Rule 15c3-1.
The financial services industry has been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny in recent years. Financial institutions have been subject to increasing regulation and supervision in the U.S. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which was enacted in July 2010, significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which financial institutions operate. The implications of the Dodd-Frank Act for our business depend to a large extent on the rules that have been or will be adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and other agencies to implement the legislation, as well as the development of market practices and structures under the regime established by the legislation and the implementation of the rules. Other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by other regulators and policy makers worldwide. We will continue to assess our business, risk management, and compliance practices to conform to developments in the regulatory environment.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of these investments. In acquiring our target assets, we will compete with financial institutions, institutional investors, other lenders, government entities and certain other REITs. For a full discussion of the risks associated with competition see the “Risks Related to Our Investing, Portfolio Management and Financing Activities” section in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Corporate Governance
We strive to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. In 2018, our Board made a number of significant corporate governance enhancements further aligning the Company’s interests with those of our stockholders. These enhancements included the amendment of the Company’s bylaws to declassify our Board over a three-year period beginning with the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders in 2019, with all directors standing for annual election by the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders in 2021. Our Board also adopted an enhanced director refreshment policy, which provides that an independent director may not stand for re-election at the next annual meeting of stockholders taking place at the end of his or her term following the earlier of his or her: (i) 12th anniversary of service on our Board or (ii) 73rd birthday. Other notable governance practices and policies include:

• | Our Board is composed of a majority of independent directors, and our Audit, Compensation and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees are composed exclusively of independent directors. 


• | Our independent directors annually select an independent director to serve as lead independent director, although the lead independent director is generally expected to serve more than one year.


• | We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets forth the basic principles and guidelines for resolving various legal and ethical


questions that may arise in the workplace and in the conduct of our business. This code is applicable to our directors, officers and employees as well as those of our Manager and subsidiaries.

• | We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which, in conjunction with the charters of our Board committees, provide the framework for the governance of our company.


• | We have procedures by which any of our employees, including employees of our Manager as well as those of our subsidiaries, officers or directors may raise concerns

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

confidentially about our company’s conduct, accounting, internal controls or auditing matters with the lead independent director, the independent directors, or the chair of the Audit Committee or through our company’s whistleblower phone hotline or e-mail inbox.

• | We have an Insider Trading Policy that prohibits our directors, officers and employees, including employees of our Manager, as well as those of our subsidiaries from buying or selling our securities on the basis of material nonpublic information and prohibits communicating material nonpublic information about our company to others. Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our officers 


and employees, from (1) pledging our stock as collateral for a loan or (2) engaging in any hedging transactions with respect to our equity securities held by them.

• | Our Board has instituted expansive employee stock ownership guidelines, pursuant to which more than 40% of our employees, including employees of our Manager, as well as those of our subsidiaries, are asked to purchase predetermined amounts of Company common stock in the open market.

Distributions
In accordance with the requirements for maintaining REIT status, we intend to distribute to stockholders aggregate dividends equaling at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction of dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain) for each taxable year and will endeavor to distribute at least 100% of our REIT taxable income so as not to be subject to tax. Distributions of economic profits from our enterprise could be classified as return of capital due to differences between book and tax accounting rules.  We may make additional returns of capital when the potential risk-adjusted returns from new investments fail to exceed our cost of capital. Subject to the limitations of applicable securities and state corporation laws, we can return capital by making purchases of our own capital stock or through payment of dividends.
