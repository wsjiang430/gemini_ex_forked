ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a leading independent entertainment marketing and premium content development company. Through our subsidiaries, 42West LLC (42West) and The Door Marketing Group LLC (The Door), we provide expert strategic marketing and publicity services to many of the top brands, both individual and corporate, in the entertainment and hospitality industries. The Door and 42West are both recognized global leaders in the PR services for the industries they serve. Our recent acquisition of Viewpoint Computer Animation Incorporated (Viewpoint) has added full-service creative branding and production capabilities to our marketing group. Dolphins legacy content production business, founded by Emmy-nominated Chief Executive Officer, Bill ODowd, has produced multiple feature films and award-winning digital series, primarily aimed at the family and young adult markets.
 We were first incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 7, 1995 and domesticated in the State of Florida on December 4, 2014. Our common stock trades on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol DLPN.
 We currently operate in two reportable segments: our entertainment publicity and marketing segment and our content production segment. The entertainment publicity and marketing segment is composed of 42West, The Door and Viewpoint and provides clients with diversified services, including public relations, entertainment content marketing, strategic communications, social media marketing, creative branding, and the production of marketing video content. The content production segment is composed of Dolphin Films, Inc. (Dolphin Films) and Dolphin Digital Studios, which produce and distribute feature films and digital content.
 With respect to our entertainment publicity and marketing segment, we currently see a favorable environment for organic growth. The original content budgets of many large studios and streaming services have grown considerably the past few years, and are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, 2019 and 2020 are scheduled to see the entrance, or large-scale expansion, of streaming services from Disney, Warner Bros., NBC Universal and Apple, all to compete with Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. We believe that the foremost differentiating factor for all of these platforms will be original programming and, consequently, it is anticipated that there will be an increase of billions of dollars in programming spend across the market. We also believe that each of these original shows will need substantial public relations and marketing campaigns to drive consumer awareness of both the show themselves and the respective platforms on which to find them.
 Additionally, we have endeavored to create a marketing super group, combining marketing, public relations, branding, and digital production, that will serve as a platform for organic growth via the cross-selling of services among our subsidiaries. By way of example, both 42West and The Door have identified the ability to create content for clients as a must have for public relations campaigns in todays environment, which relies so heavily on video clips to drive social media awareness and engagement. Thus, we believe that our acquisition of Viewpoint provides a critical competitive advantage in the acquisition of new clients in the entertainment and lifestyle marketing space, and has the potential to fuel topline revenue growth as the average revenue per client increases with the cross-selling of video content creation services.
 Finally, we believe that 42West and our existing portfolio of public relations and marketing companies will continue to attract future acquisitions. We believe that our marketing super group is unique in the industry, as a collection of best-in-class service providers across a variety of entertainment and lifestyle verticals. We further believe that with each new acquisition in this space, our portfolio will increase its breadth and depth of services and, therefore, be able to offer an even more compelling opportunity for other industry leaders to join, and enjoy the benefits of cross-selling to a wide variety of existing and potential clients. Thus, we believe we can continue to grow both revenues and profits through future acquisitions into our entertainment publicity and marketing segment.

Growth Opportunities and Strategies
 We are focused on driving growth through the following:
 Expand and grow 42West to serve more clients with a broad array of interrelated services. As a result of 42Wests acquisition by Dolphin and enhanced by the recent acquisition of Viewpoint, 42West has the ability to create promotional and marketing content for clients, a critical service for celebrities and marketers alike in todays digital world. We believe that by the addition of content creation to 42Wests capabilities, we can capitalize on unique synergies to drive organic growth, which we expect will allow us to both attract new clients and broaden our offering of billable services to existing ones. We also believe that the skills and experience of our 42West business in entertainment PR are readily transferable to related business sectors, such as sports. The growing involvement in non-entertainment businesses by many of our existing entertainment clients has allowed 42West to establish a presence and develop expertise outside its traditional footprint. Using this as a foundation, we are now working to expand our involvement in these new areas.
 We also expect to continue to grow 42Wests current business divisions. For example:
 ·
 In the Entertainment Marketing division, several of our large key clients have announced increased movie marketing budgets over the next several years that we expect will drive growth of our revenue and profits;

·
 In the Talent division, we expect to continue to drive significant growth through the hiring of additional individuals or teams whose existing books of business and talent rosters can be accretive to revenues and profits of the business; and

·
 In the Strategic Communications division, we believe that growth will be driven by increasing demand for these services by traditional and non-traditional media clients over the next three to five years as they expand their activities in the content production, branding, and consumer products sectors. We believe that this growth could result in the Strategic Communications division significantly increasing its contribution to revenue and profit, as this division typically generates higher profit margins than the other 42West divisions.
 Expand and grow The Door through the expansion of Consumer Products PR business. The Doors market-leading position in both the food and hospitality verticals, with many clients which have consumer-facing products and the need for attendant marketing campaigns, has provided the Company with the requisite experience for a successful entry into the high-margin consumer products PR business with potential clients outside of the food and hospitality verticals. We plan to significantly increase the number of consumer products PR accounts at The Door through the hiring of a dedicated team of experienced professionals for this new business line. Such accounts often generate higher monthly fees and longer-term engagements than any other customer vertical. 
 Diversify Viewpoints Client Base. Viewpoint is a leading creative branding agency and promotional video content producer for the television industry, with long-term clients such as HBO, Discovery Networks, Showtime and AMC. Through 42West and The Door, Viewpoint can offer its best-in-class services to several new verticals, including motion picture production and distribution companies, restaurant groups, the hospitality and travel industry and the marketers of consumer products. The ability for Viewpoint to reach clients of 42West and The Door provides Viewpoint with the opportunity to diversity its client base, while allowing 42West and The Door to increase their service offerings to, existing and future clients, potentially driving increased revenues.
 Opportunistically grow through complementary acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue acquisitions to further enhance our competitive advantages, scale our revenues, and increase our profitability. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring companies that complement our existing entertainment publicity services businesses. We believe that complementary businesses, such as digital and social media marketing, event planning and PR firms in other entertainment verticals, can create synergistic opportunities that may increase profits and operating cash flow. We intend to complete at least one acquisition during the next year, although there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.
 Build a portfolio of premium film, television and digital content. We intend to grow and diversify our portfolio of film and digital content by capitalizing on demand for high quality digital media and film content throughout the world marketplace. We plan to balance our financial risks against the probability of commercial success for each project. We believe that our strategic focus on content and creation of innovative content distribution strategies will enhance our competitive position in the industry, ensure optimal use of our capital, build a diversified foundation for future growth and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Finally, we believe that marketing strategies that will be developed by 42West will drive our creative content, thus creating greater potential for profitability.

Entertainment Publicity and Marketing

42West
 Through 42West, an entertainment public relations agency, we offer talent publicity, entertainment (motion picture and television) marketing and strategic communications services. Prior to its acquisition, 42West grew to become one of the largest independently-owned public relations firms in the entertainment industry. As such, we believe that 42West has served, and will continue to serve, as an acquisition magnet for us to acquire new members of our marketing super group, which has the ability to provide synergistic new members with the opportunity to grow revenues and profits through 42Wests access, relationships and experience in the entertainment industry.
 Our public relations and marketing professionals at 42West develop and execute marketing and publicity strategies for dozens of movies and television shows annually, as well as for individual actors, filmmakers, recording artists, and authors. Through 42West, we provide services in the following areas:
 Talent Publicity
 We focus on creating and implementing strategic communication campaigns for performers and entertainers, including television and film stars, recording artists, authors, models and theater actors. Our talent roster includes Oscar- and Emmy-winning actors and Grammy-nominated singers and musicians and New York Times best-selling authors. Our services in this area include ongoing strategic counsel, media relations, studio, network, charity, corporate liaison and event and tour support.
Entertainment Marketing
 We provide marketing direction, public relations counsel and media strategy for productions (including theatrical films, DVD and VOD releases, television programs, and online series) as well as content producers, ranging from individual filmmakers and creative artists to production companies, film financiers, DVD distributors, and other entities. Our capabilities include worldwide studio releases, independent films, television programming and web productions. We provide entertainment marketing services in connection with film festivals, awards campaigns, event publicity and red carpet management. 
Strategic Communications
 Our strategic communications team advises high-profile individuals and companies faced with sensitive situations or looking to raise, reposition, or rehabilitate their public profiles. We also help studios and filmmakers deal with controversial movies.
 Much of the activities of our strategic communications team involves orchestrating high-stakes communications campaigns in response to sensitive, complex situations where clients seek to rehabilitate their public profiles. We also help companies define objectives, develop messaging, create brand identities, and construct long-term strategies to achieve specific goals, as well as manage functions such as media relations or internal communications on a day-to-day basis. The strategic communications team focuses on strategic communications counsel, corporate positioning, brand enhancement, media relations, reputation and issues management, litigation support and crisis management and communications. Our clients include major studios and production companies, record labels, media conglomerates, technology companies, philanthropic organizations, talent guilds, and trade associations, as well as a wide variety of high-profile individuals, ranging from major movie and pop stars to top executives and entrepreneurs.
 The Door
 Through The Door, a hospitality, lifestyle and consumer products public relations agency, we offer traditional public relations services, as well as social media marketing, creative branding, and strategic counsel. Prior to its acquisition by us, The Door was widely considered the leading independent public relations firm in the hospitality and lifestyle industries. Among other benefits, The Door acquisition has expanded our entertainment verticals through the addition of celebrity chefs and their restaurants, as well as with live events, such as some of the most prestigious food and wine festivals. 
 Our public relations and marketing professionals at The Door develop and execute marketing and publicity strategies for dozens of restaurant and hotel groups annually, as well as for individual chefs, live events, and consumer-facing corporations.

Viewpoint
 Viewpoint is a full-service, boutique creative branding and production agency that has earned a reputation as one of the top producers of promotional brand-support videos for a wide variety of leading cable networks in the television industry. Viewpoints capabilities run the full range of creative branding and production, from concept creation to final delivery, and include: brand strategy, concept and creative development, design & art direction, script & copywriting, live action production & photography, digital development, video editing & composite, animation, audio mixing & engineering, project management and technical support.
Content Production
 Dolphin Films
 Dolphin Films is a content producer of motion pictures. We own the rights to several scripts that we intend to produce at a future date.
 Our pipeline of feature films includes:
 ·
 Youngblood, an updated version of the 1986 hockey classic;
 ·
 Out of Their League, a romantic comedy pitting husband against wife in the cut-throat world of fantasy football; and
 ·
 Ask Me, a teen comedy in which a high-school student starts a business to help her classmates create elaborate promposals.
 We have completed development of each of these feature films, which means that we have completed the script and can begin pre-production if and when financing is obtained. We also own several other scripts that we may determine to produce as digital content if online distribution is secured. 
Dolphin Digital Studios
 Dolphin Digital Studios creates original content to premiere online in the form of web series, sources financing for our digital media projects and distributes our web series through a variety of distribution partners depending on the demographic served.
Competition
 The businesses in which we engage are highly competitive. Through 42West and The Door, we compete against other public relations and marketing communications companies, as well as independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships. Through Viewpoint, we compete against other creative branding agencies, as well as in-house creative teams at many of our clients. Our content production business faces competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, video games and computer-related activities. We are subject to competition from other digital media and motion production companies, as well as from large, well-established companies within the entertainment industry that have significantly greater development, production, distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the acquisition of literary properties and for the services of producers, directors, actors and other artists as well as creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our business. In addition, our productions compete for audience acceptance and advertising dollars.
 We believe that we compete on the basis of the following competitive strengths:
 ·
 Market Reputations of 42West and The Door — both 42West and The Door consistently rank among the most prestigious and powerful public relations firms in the United States (both ranking in the Top 15 Most Powerful PR Firms each of the last two years, as published by the New York Observer), which is a significant competitive advantage given the nature of the entertainment marketing and public relations industry, in which “perception is power”;

·
 An Exceptional Management Team—our CEO, Mr. O’Dowd, has a 20-year history of producing and delivering high-quality family entertainment. In addition, 42Wests three co-CEOs, Leslee Dart, Amanda Lundberg, and Allan Mayer, along with The Doors CEO, Charlie Dougiello and President, Lois ONeill, are all longtime PR practitioners, with decades of experience, and are widely regarded as being among the top communications strategists in the entertainment industry, as evidenced by the market reputation of their companies; and
 ·
 Our Ability to Offer Interrelated Services—we believe that the ability to create video and other promotional content for our 42West and The Door clients, primarily through the services of Viewpoint, and the ability to internally develop and execute marketing campaigns for our digital and film productions will allow us to expand and grow each of our business lines.
