ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 We are a Maryland corporation, incorporated in 2005, and a real estate finance company that is organized and conducts our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Our investment strategy is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial mortgage loans and commercial real estate-related debt investments. We are externally managed by Exantas Capital Manager Inc., or our Manager, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners LLC, or C-III, a leading commercial real estate, or CRE, investment management and services company engaged in a broad range of activities. Our Manager draws upon the management teams of C-III and its subsidiaries and its collective investment experience to provide its services.
 Our objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including quarterly distributions and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies. We finance a substantial portion of our portfolio investments through borrowing strategies seeking to match the maturities and repricing dates of our financings with the maturities and repricing dates of those financed investments, and we seek to mitigate interest rate risk through derivative investments.
 Our investment strategy targets the following core asset class:
  
CRE/Core Asset Class | Principal Investments
Commercial real estate-related assets | ● | First mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans; 
 | ● | First priority interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as A-notes; 
 | ● | Subordinated interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as B-notes; 
 | ● | Mezzanine debt related to CRE that is senior to the borrower's equity position but subordinated to other third-party debt; 
 | ● | Preferred equity investments related to CRE that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by the property underlying the investment;
 | ● | Commercial mortgage-backed securities, which we refer to as CMBS; and 
 | ● | CRE equity investments. 

 In November 2016, we received approval from our board of directors, or our Board, to execute a strategic plan, or the Plan, to focus our strategy on CRE debt investments. The Plan contemplated disposing of certain legacy CRE debt investments, exiting underperforming non-core asset classes and investments, and establishing a dividend policy based on sustainable earnings. Legacy CRE loans are loans underwritten prior to 2010, or legacy CRE loans. 
 We began to implement the Plan during the fourth quarter of 2016 and as a result, two non-core operating segments: (i) residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, and (ii) middle market secured corporate loans and preferred equity investments, were reclassified as held for sale and are considered discontinued operations at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 We have substantially completed the execution of the Plan. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $29.8 million of the $480.1 million of identified Plan assets remaining, of which $28.5 million related to two remaining legacy CRE loans. We have deployed the capital received from executing the Plan primarily into our CRE lending business and CMBS investments. These investments were initially financed in part through our CRE and CMBS term facilities and, in the case of CRE loans, through securitizations.
 We typically target transitional floating-rate CRE loans between $20.0 million and $30.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated 41 CRE loans with total commitments of $861.6 million, which was our highest production year since inception. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired CMBS with total face values of $252.3 million. We expect to continue to diversify and extend the duration of our core CRE portfolio by investing in CMBS where we see attractive investment opportunities. We expect to see continued positive momentum in 2019 and anticipate that our originations and investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 will be between $850.0 million and $1.0 billion for the calendar year.
 Our Business Strategy
 The core components of our business strategy are:
 Investment in CRE assets. We are currently invested in CRE whole loans, CRE mezzanine loans, CRE preferred equity interests and investment grade and non-investment grade CMBS. Our goal is to allocate 90% to 100% of our equity to CRE investments. At December 31, 2018, our equity was allocated as follows: 95% in core assets and 5% in non-core assets.

Managing our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2018, we managed $2.1 billion of assets, including $742.0 million of assets that were financed and held in variable interest entities. The core of our management process is credit analysis, which our Manager, with the assistance of C-III, uses to actively monitor our existing investments and as a basis for evaluating new investments. Senior management of our Manager and C-III have extensive experience in underwriting the credit risk associated with our targeted asset classes and conduct detailed due diligence on all investments. After we make investments, our Manager and C-III actively monitor them for early detection of trouble or deterioration. If a default occurs, we will use our senior management team's asset management experience in seeking to mitigate the severity of any loss and to optimize the recovery from assets collateralizing the investment.
 Managing our interest rate and liquidity risk. We engage in a number of business activities that are vulnerable to interest rate and liquidity risk and we seek to manage those risks. Our hedging strategy intends to take advantage of commonly available derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps and caps, to reduce, to the extent possible, those risks. The risks on our short-term financing agreements, principally repurchase agreements, are managed by limiting our financial exposure under the agreements to either a stated investment amount or a fixed guaranty amount. The risks on our long-term financing agreements, principally term financing facilities, are managed by seeking to match the maturity and repricing dates of our financed investments with the maturities and repricing dates of our long-term financing facilities. Additionally, we match investment and financing maturity and repricing dates using securitization vehicles structured by our Manager and, subject to the availability of markets for securitization financings, we expect to continue to use securitizations in the future to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy.
 At December 31, 2018, our repurchase facilities with debt outstanding were as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 | Outstanding Borrowings (1)(2) | | Value of Collateral | | | Equity at Risk (3)
----------------------------------------+-------------------------------+---------+---------------------+---+-----------+-------------------
At December 31, 2018: | | | | | | | |

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. | | 7,305 | | | 9,158 | | $ | 1,868 
Total | $ | 803,268 | | $ | 1,092,083 | | | 


(1) | Outstanding borrowings includes accrued interest payable and deferred debt issuance costs.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The repurchase agreements exclude the trust certificate - term repurchase facility outstanding.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Equity at risk includes accrued interest receivable net of accrued interest payable.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These borrowings charged a floating rate of interest. For more information concerning our term facilities and repurchase agreements, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources," and Note 10 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," of this report. We continuously monitor our compliance with all of the financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants, as defined in the respective agreements, at December 31, 2018.
 Diversification of investments. We manage our investment risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio of commercial mortgage loans and CRE-related investments. As funds become available for investment or reinvestment, we seek to maintain diversification by property type and geographic location while allocating our capital to investment opportunities that we believe are the most economically attractive. The percentage of assets that we have invested in certain non-core and real estate-related investments is subject to the federal income tax requirements for REIT qualification and the requirements for exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act.
 Our Operating Policies
 Investment guidelines. We have established investment policies, procedures and guidelines that are reviewed and approved by our Manager's investment committee and our Board. The investment committee and/or our Board, as applicable, meets regularly to consider and approve proposed specific investments. Our Board monitors the execution of our overall investment strategies and targeted asset classes. We acquire our investments primarily for income. We do not have a policy that requires us to focus our investments in one or more particular geographic areas or industries.
 Financing policies. We use leverage in order to increase potential returns to our stockholders and for financing our portfolio. We do not speculate on changes in interest rates. Although we have identified leverage targets for each of our targeted asset classes, our investment policies do not have any minimum or maximum leverage limits. Our Manager's investment committee has the discretion, without the need for further approval by our Board, to increase the amount of leverage we incur above our targeted range for individual asset classes subject, however, to any leverage constraints that may be imposed by existing financing arrangements.

We use borrowing and securitization strategies to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy. Based upon current conditions in the credit markets for CDOs and CLOs, we expect to modestly increase leverage through new CLO securitizations and the continued use of our term repurchase and short-term repurchase facilities in 2019. We may also seek other credit arrangements to finance new investments that we believe can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, subject to availability.
 Hedging and interest rate management policies. We use derivative instruments to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. Under the federal income tax laws applicable to REITs, we generally will be able to enter into transactions to hedge indebtedness that we may incur, or plan to incur, to acquire or carry real estate assets, provided that our total gross income from qualifying hedges does not exceed 25% of our total gross income and non-qualifying hedges do not exceed 5% of our total gross income. We generally seek to minimize interest rate risk with a strategy that is expected to result in the least amount of volatility under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, while still meeting our strategic economic objectives and maintaining adequate liquidity and flexibility. These hedging transactions may include interest rate swaps, collars, caps or floors, puts, calls, options and foreign currency exchange protection.
 Credit and risk management policies. Our Manager focuses its attention on credit and risk assessment from the earliest stage of the investment selection process. In addition, our Manager screens and monitors all potential investments to determine their impact on maintaining our REIT qualification under federal income tax laws and our exclusion from investment company status under the Investment Company Act. Portfolio risks, including risks related to credit losses, interest rate volatility, liquidity and counterparty credit, are generally managed on a portfolio-by-portfolio basis by our Manager.

Core Asset Classes
 CRE Debt Investments
 Whole loans. We predominantly originate first mortgage loans, or whole loans, directly to borrowers. The direct origination of whole loans enables us to better control the structure of the loans and to maintain direct lending relationships with borrowers. We may create tranches of a loan we originate, consisting of an A-note (described below) and a B-note (described below), as well as mezzanine loans or other participations, which we may hold or sell to third parties. We do not obtain ratings on these investments. With respect to our portfolio at December 31, 2018, our whole loan investments had loan-to-collateral value, or LTV, ratios that typically do not exceed 85%. Typically, our whole loans are structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. Substantially all of our CRE loans held at December 31, 2018 were whole loans. We expect to hold our whole loans to maturity.

(Back to Index)
 
Senior interests in whole loans (A-notes). We may invest in senior interests in whole loans, referred to as A-notes, either directly originated or purchased from third parties. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical A-note investments to have LTV ratios not exceeding 70%, and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any A-note investments to maturity. We did not hold any A-note investments at December 31, 2018.
 Subordinate interests in whole loans (B-notes). To a lesser extent, we may invest in subordinate interests in whole loans, referred to as B-notes, which we will either directly originate or purchase from third parties. B-notes are loans secured by a first mortgage but are subordinated to an A-note. The subordination of a B-note is generally evidenced by an intercreditor or participation agreement between the holders of the A-note and the B-note. In some instances, the B-note lender may require a security interest in the stock or other equity interests of the borrower as part of the transaction. B-note lenders have the same obligations, collateral and borrower as the A-note lender, but typically are subordinated in recovery upon a default to the A-note lender. B-notes share certain credit characteristics with second mortgages in that both are subject to greater credit risk with respect to the underlying mortgage collateral than the corresponding first mortgage or A-note. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical B-note investments to have LTV ratios between 55% and 80%, and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any B-note investments to maturity. We did not hold any B-note investments at December 31, 2018.
 In addition to the accrued interest receivable on a B-note, we may earn fees charged to the borrower under the note or additional income by receiving principal payments in excess of the discounted price (below par value) we paid to acquire the note. Our ownership of a B-note with controlling class rights may, in the event the financing fails to perform according to its terms, cause us to pursue our remedies as owner of the B-note, which may include foreclosure on, or modification of, the note. In some cases, the owner of the A-note may be able to foreclose or modify the note against our wishes as owner of the B-note. As a result, our economic and business interests may diverge from the interests of the owner of the A-note.
 Mezzanine financing. We may invest in mezzanine loans that are senior to the borrower's equity in, and subordinate to the mortgage loan on, a property. A mezzanine loan is typically secured by a pledge of the ownership interests in the entity that directly owns the real property or by a second lien mortgage loan on the property. In addition, mezzanine loans typically include credit enhancements such as letters of credit, personal guarantees of the principals of the borrower, or collateral unrelated to the property. A mezzanine loan may be structured so that we receive a stated fixed or variable interest rate on the loan as well as a percentage of gross revenues and a percentage of the increase in the fair market value of the property securing the loan, payable upon maturity, refinancing or sale of the property. Mezzanine loans may also have prepayment lockouts, penalties, minimum profit hurdles and other mechanisms to protect and enhance returns in the event of premature repayment. We expect our mezzanine investments to have LTV ratios between 65% and 90% with stated maturities from three to five years. We expect to hold mezzanine loans to maturity. At December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio included two mezzanine loans.
 Preferred equity investments. We may invest in preferred equity investments in entities that own or acquire CRE properties. These investments are subordinate to first mortgage loans and mezzanine debt and are typically structured to provide some credit enhancement differentiating it from the common equity. We expect our preferred equity investments to have LTV ratios between 65% and 90% with stated maturities from three to eight years. We expect to hold preferred equity investments to maturity. At December 31, 2018, we had one preferred equity investment.

The following charts describe the property type and the geographic breakdown, by National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries, or NCREIF, region of our CRE loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 (based on carrying value), excluding our legacy CRE loans classified as assets held for sale:
 


The total loan portfolio, at carrying value, was $1.6 billion at December 31, 2018. "Other" property types included self-storage (2.4%), industrial (1.3%) and manufactured housing (1.3%).

(Back to Index)
 
The Southwest region constituted 32.3% of our portfolio, of which 30.4% was in Texas, and its collateral was comprised of 81.5% multifamily properties. The Mountain region constituted 20.9% of our portfolio, of which 11.3% was in Arizona, and its collateral was comprised of 75.2% multifamily properties and 21.2% hotel properties. The Pacific region constituted 17.1% of our portfolio and its collateral was comprised of 52.2% retail properties. In the Pacific region, Southern California constituted 11.9% of the total loan portfolio and Northern California constituted 4.0% of the total loan portfolio. We view our investment and credit strategies as being adequately diversified across property types in the Southwest, Mountain and Pacific regions.
 As part of the Plan, certain underperforming legacy CRE loans were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2018, we had one remaining legacy CRE loan classified as held for sale.
 CMBS
 We invest in CMBS, which are securities that are secured by, or evidence interests in, a pool of mortgage loans secured by commercial properties. These securities may be senior or subordinate and may be either investment grade or non-investment grade. The majority of our CMBS investments have been rated by at least one nationally recognized rating agency.
 The yields on CMBS depend on the timely payment of interest and principal due on the underlying mortgage loans, and defaults by the borrowers on such loans may ultimately result in deficiencies and defaults on the CMBS. In the event of a default, the trustee for the benefit of the holders of CMBS has recourse only to the underlying pool of mortgage loans and, if a loan is in default, to the mortgaged property securing such mortgage loan. After the trustee has exercised all of the rights of a lender under a defaulted mortgage loan and the related mortgaged property has been liquidated, no further remedy is available. However, holders of relatively senior classes of a CMBS trust will be protected to a certain degree by the structural features of the securitization transaction, such as the subordination of junior classes of the CMBS trust.
 CRE Equity Investments
 We may invest directly in the ownership of CRE equity investments by restructuring CRE loans and taking control of the properties where we believe we can protect capital and ultimately generate capital appreciation. We may acquire CRE equity investments through a joint venture or wholly-owned subsidiary. We intend to primarily use an affiliate of our Manager to manage the CRE equity investments when held. At December 31, 2018, we had no direct ownership of any CRE equity investments.
Non-Core Asset Classes
 Structured Note Investments and RMBS
 We have historically invested in structured notes and RMBS as part of our trading portfolio. Structured note investments are investments in structured finance vehicles that are typically among the most junior debt securities, or are equity securities, issued by the vehicle. These notes and equity securities typically receive quarterly interest payments or distributions only after the more senior debt securities issued by the vehicle have received all amounts contractually then owned to them. We also have invested in RMBS, which are securities that are secured or evidenced by interests in pools of residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018, we had one investment in a structured note with no carrying value and no investments in RMBS.
Residential Mortgage Origination
 Primary Capital Mortgage, LLC, or PCM, is a residential mortgage lender and servicer that were moved to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. PCM's assets and liabilities were marked to the lower of cost or fair market value, less cost to sell, and transferred to held for sale status. We liquidated the remaining assets in 2018.
Middle Market Loans
 We have historically made both senior and subordinated, secured and unsecured loans to middle market companies either through directly originated transactions or purchases from third parties. As part of our Plan, our middle market business was moved to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the remaining assets were marked to the lower of cost or fair market value, less cost to sell, and transferred to held for sale status. We liquidated the remaining loans in 2018.

Management Agreement
 We have a management agreement, amended and restated on December 14, 2017, or the Management Agreement, with our Manager pursuant to which our Manager provides the day-to-day management of our operations. The Management Agreement requires our Manager to manage our business affairs in conformity with the policies and investment guidelines established by our Board. Our Manager provides its services under the supervision and direction of our Board. Our Manager is responsible for the selection, purchase and sale of our portfolio investments, our financing activities and providing us with investment advisory services. Our Manager and its affiliates also provide us with a Chief Financial Officer and a sufficient number of additional accounting, finance, tax and investor relations professionals. Our Manager receives fees and is reimbursed for its expenses as follows:

• | A monthly base management fee equal to 1/12th of the amount of our equity multiplied by 1.50%; however, the base management fee was fixed at $937,500 per month from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018. Under the Management Agreement, ''equity'' is equal to the net proceeds from issuances of shares of capital stock (or the value of common shares upon the conversion of convertible securities), less offering-related costs, plus or minus our retained earnings (excluding non-cash equity compensation incurred in current or prior periods) less all amounts we have paid for common stock and preferred stock repurchases. The calculation is adjusted for one-time events due to changes in GAAP as well as other non-cash charges, upon approval of our independent directors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Incentive compensation, calculated quarterly as follows: (A) 20% of the amount by which our Core Earnings (as defined in the Management Agreement) for a quarter exceeds the product of (i) the weighted average of (x) the per share book value of our common shares at September 30, 2017 (subject to adjustments for certain items of income or loss from operations or gain or loss on resolutions of the Plan assets from October 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018) and (y) the per share price (including the conversion price, if applicable) paid for our common shares in each offering (or issuance upon the conversion of convertible securities) by us subsequent to September 30, 2017, multiplied by (ii) the greater of (x) 1.75% and (y) 0.4375% plus one-fourth of the Ten Year Treasury Rate for such quarter; multiplied by (B) the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during such quarter; subject to adjustment (a) to exclude events pursuant to changes in GAAP or the application of GAAP as well as non-recurring or unusual transactions or events, after discussion between our Manager and the independent directors and approval by a majority of the independent directors in the case of non-recurring or unusual transactions or events, and (b) to deduct an amount equal to any fees paid directly by a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, (or any subsidiary thereof) to employees, agents and/or affiliates of the Manager with respect to profits of such TRS (or subsidiary thereof) generated from the services of such employees, agents and/or affiliates, the fee structure of which shall have been approved by a majority of the independent directors and which fees may not exceed 20% of the net income (before such fees) of such TRS (or subsidiary thereof).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Per-loan underwriting and review fees in connection with valuations of and potential investments in certain subordinate commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, in amounts approved by a majority of the independent directors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses and certain other costs incurred by our Manager and its affiliates that relate directly to us and our operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reimbursement of our Manager's and its affiliates' expenses for (A) the wages, salaries and benefits of our Chief Financial Officer, (B) a portion of the wages, salaries and benefits of accounting, finance, tax and investor relations professionals, in proportion to such personnel's percentage of time allocated to our operations, and (C) personnel principally devoted to our ancillary operating subsidiaries.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Incentive compensation is calculated and payable quarterly to our Manager to the extent it is earned. Up to 75% of the incentive compensation is payable in cash and at least 25% is payable in the form of an award of common stock. Our Manager may elect to receive more than 25% of its incentive compensation in common stock. All shares are fully vested upon issuance; however, our Manager may not sell such shares for one year after the incentive compensation becomes due and payable unless the Management Agreement is terminated. Shares payable as incentive compensation are valued as follows:
  
• | if such shares are traded on a securities exchange, at the average of the closing prices of the shares on such exchange over the 30-day period ending three days prior to the issuance of such shares;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if such shares are actively traded over-the-counter, at the average of the closing bid or sales price as applicable over the 30-day period ending three days prior to the issuance of such shares; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if there is no active market for such shares, at the fair market value as reasonably determined in good faith by our Board.

The Management Agreement's current contract term ends on March 31, 2019, and the agreement provides for automatic one year renewals on such date and on each March 31 thereafter until terminated. Our Board reviews our Manager's performance annually. The Management Agreement may be terminated annually upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based upon unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us or a determination by our independent directors that the management fees payable to our Manager are not fair, subject to our Manager's right to prevent such a compensation termination by accepting a mutually acceptable reduction of management fees. Our Board must provide 180 days' prior notice of any such termination. If we terminate the Management Agreement, our Manager is entitled to a termination fee equal to four times the sum of the average annual base management fee and the average annual incentive compensation earned by our Manager during the two 12-month periods immediately preceding the date of termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter before the date of termination.
 We may also terminate the Management Agreement for cause with 30 days' prior written notice from our Board. No termination fee is payable in the event of a termination for cause. The Management Agreement defines cause as:
  
• | our Manager's continued material breach of any provision of the Management Agreement following a period of 30 days after written notice thereof;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our Manager's fraud, misappropriation of funds, or embezzlement against us;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Regulatory Aspects of Our Investment Strategy: Exclusion from Regulation Under the Investment Company Act
 We operate our business so as to be excluded from regulation under the Investment Company Act. Because we conduct our business through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we must ensure not only that we qualify for an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act, but also that each of our subsidiaries also qualifies.
 We believe that RCC Real Estate, Inc., or RCC Real Estate, the subsidiary that at December 31, 2018 held substantially all of our CRE loan assets, is excluded from Investment Company Act regulation under Section 3(c)(5)(C), a provision designed for companies that do not issue redeemable securities and are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. To qualify for this exclusion, at least 55% of RCC Real Estate's assets must consist of mortgage loans and other assets that are considered the functional equivalent of mortgage loans for purposes of the Investment Company Act and interests in real properties, which we refer to as Qualifying Interests. Moreover, 80% of RCC Real Estate's assets must consist of Qualifying Interests and other real estate-related assets. RCC Real Estate has not issued, and does not intend to issue, redeemable securities.

We treat our investments in CRE whole loans, A-notes, specific types of B-notes and specific types of mezzanine loans as Qualifying Interests for purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to the extent such treatment is consistent with guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or its staff. We believe that SEC staff guidance allows us to treat B-notes as Qualifying Interests where we have unilateral rights to instruct the servicer to foreclose upon a defaulted mortgage loan, replace the servicer in the event the servicer, in its discretion, elects not to foreclose on such a loan, and purchase the A-note in the event of a default on the mortgage loan. We believe, based upon an analysis of existing SEC staff guidance, that we may treat mezzanine loans as Qualifying Interests where (i) the borrower is a special purpose bankruptcy-remote entity whose sole purpose is to hold all of the ownership interests in another special purpose entity that owns commercial real property, (ii) both entities are organized as limited liability companies or limited partnerships, (iii) under their organizational documents and the loan documents, neither entity may engage in any other business, (iv) the ownership interests of either entity have no value apart from the underlying real property which is essentially the only asset held by the property-owning entity, (v) the value of the underlying property in excess of the amount of senior obligations is in excess of the amount of the mezzanine loan, (vi) the borrower pledges its entire interest in the property-owning entity to the lender which obtains a perfected security interest in the collateral and (vii) the relative rights and priorities between the mezzanine lender and the senior lenders with respect to claims on the underlying property are set forth in an intercreditor agreement between the parties which gives the mezzanine lender certain cure and purchase rights in case there is a default on the senior loan. If the SEC staff provides future guidance that these investments are not Qualifying Interests, then we will treat them, for purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous assets, as appropriate. Historically, we have held "whole pool certificates" in mortgage loans, although, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no whole pool certificates in our portfolios. Pursuant to existing SEC staff guidance, we consider whole pool certificates to be Qualifying Interests. A whole pool certificate is a certificate that represents the entire beneficial interest in an underlying pool of mortgage loans. By contrast, a certificate that represents less than the entire beneficial interest in the underlying mortgage loans is not considered to be a Qualifying Interest for purposes of the 55% test, but constitutes a real estate-related asset for purposes of the 80% test. We do not expect that investments in CDOs, asset-backed securities, or ABS, syndicated corporate loans, lease receivables, trust preferred securities or private equity will constitute Qualifying Interests. Moreover, to the extent that these investments are not backed by mortgage loans or other interests in real estate, they will not constitute real estate-related assets. Instead, they will constitute miscellaneous assets, which can constitute no more than 20% of RCC Real Estate's assets.
 To the extent RCC Real Estate holds its CRE loan assets through wholly or majority-owned CDO subsidiaries, RCC Real Estate also intends to conduct its operations so that it will not come within the definition of an investment company set forth in Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis will consist of "investment securities," which we refer to as the 40% test. "Investment securities" exclude U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Certain of the wholly-owned CDO subsidiaries of RCC Real Estate rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) for their Investment Company Act exemption, with the result that RCC Real Estate's interests in the CDO subsidiaries do not constitute "investment securities" for the purpose of the 40% test.
 Our other subsidiaries, RCC Commercial, Inc., or RCC Commercial, RCC Commercial II, Inc., or Commercial II, RCC Commercial III, Inc., or Commercial III, RCC TRS, LLC, or RCC TRS, Resource TRS, LLC, or Resource TRS, RSO EquityCo, LLC, or RSO Equity, RCC Residential Portfolio, Inc., or RCC Resi Portfolio and RCC Residential Portfolio TRS, Inc., or RCC Resi TRS, do not qualify for the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion. However, we believe they qualify for exclusion under either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7). As required by these exclusions, we will not allow any of these entities to make, or propose to make, a public offering of its securities. In addition, with respect to those subsidiaries for which we rely upon the Section 3(c)(1) exclusion, and as required thereby, we limit the number of holders of their securities to not more than 100 persons calculated in accordance with the attribution rules of Section 3(c)(1), and with respect to those subsidiaries for which we rely on the Section 3(c)(7) exclusion, and as required thereby, we limit ownership of their securities to "qualified purchasers." If we form other subsidiaries, we must ensure that they qualify for an exemption or exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act.
 Moreover, we must ensure that Exantas Capital Corp. itself qualifies for an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. We do so by monitoring the value of our interests in our subsidiaries so that we can ensure that Exantas Capital Corp. satisfies the 40% test. Our interest in RCC Real Estate does not constitute an "investment security" for purposes of the 40% test, but our interests in RCC Commercial, Commercial II, Commercial III, RCC TRS, Resource TRS, RSO Equity, RCC Resi Portfolio and RCC Resi TRS do. Accordingly, we must monitor the value of our interests in those subsidiaries to ensure that the value of our interests in them does not exceed 40% of the value of our total assets.
 We have not received, nor have we sought, a no-action letter from the SEC regarding how our investment strategy fits within the exclusions from regulation under the Investment Company Act. To the extent that the SEC provides more specific or different guidance regarding the treatment of assets as Qualifying Interests or real estate-related assets, we may have to adjust our investment strategy. Any additional or different guidance from the SEC could inhibit our ability to pursue our investment strategy.
