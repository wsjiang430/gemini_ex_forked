carrier contamination control systems, and reticle storage solutions to the global semiconductor capital equipment industry. We sell our semiconductor products and services to both original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and directly to global chip manufacturers. 
In April 2018, we acquired Tec-Sem Group AG, or Tec-Sem, a Switzerland-based manufacturer of semiconductor fabrication automation equipment with a focus on reticle storage management systems that support the needs for advanced lithography. Prior to fiscal year 2016, we made several acquisitions that support our business in the semiconductor market. On July 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our semiconductor cryogenics business to Edwards Vacuum LLC (a member of the Atlas Copco Group) for approximately $675.0 million in cash subject to adjustments for working capital and other items. 
We have also invested in research and development initiatives to advance the offerings acquired in these acquisitions, as well as in our vacuum automation and services offerings. Our business supporting the semiconductor capital equipment and adjacent markets provided approximately 57% of our revenue in fiscal year 2019.
We entered the life sciences market, specifically in the area of sample management storage systems, in 2011. We entered this market based on our ability to leverage our core technology competencies in automation and cryogenics into our sample management offerings. We applied these competencies to provide a range of automated ultra-cold freezer systems and then to expand into a portfolio of products and services to assist customers in efficiently managing the end-to-end “cold chain of custody” of their chemical compound and biological samples. Today, we are a leading provider of the life sciences sample management solutions for automated cold sample storage systems, off-site storage services, and consumables and instruments. We are also a provider of software offerings which enable or enhance our customers’ visibility into their sample inventories, and laboratory services at our storage service locations, both of which are expected to help our customers accelerate their research and development efforts. Taken together, we believe our sample management product and services offerings allow our customers to maintain a complete “cold chain of custody” and enhance efficiency of related workflow for their samples. 
On November 15, 2018, we significantly expanded our life sciences offerings with the acquisition of GENEWIZ Group, or GENEWIZ, a leading provider of gene sequencing and gene synthesis services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic institutions around the world. GENEWIZ is headquartered in New Jersey and has a network of genomics laboratories spanning the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We believe the GENEWIZ acquisition, combined with our core capabilities in sample management services, positions us to add more value to samples under our care.
In addition to the GENEWIZ acquisition, over the last four fiscal years we have completed six acquisitions to expand and enhance our life science sample management offerings and establish a comprehensive portfolio of sample management solutions. Three of these acquisitions were outsourced sample management services companies. 

● | In November 2015, we acquired BioStorage Technologies, Inc., a full-service outsourcing sample management business, supporting customers in the United States, Europe, and Asia with an integrated solution for off-site storage services, transportation services, laboratory services and software-based inventory management.

● | In October 2017, we acquired 4titude Limited, or 4titude, a U.K.-based manufacturer of scientific consumables used in a variety of genomic analytical applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through the acquisitions described above, we have expanded product and service offerings, accelerated product development cycles, broadened our installed base and added customer relationships to our life science business. As such, we use acquisitions and divestitures to strengthen our portfolio and achieve increased growth and profitability. For further information on our acquisitions and equity investments, please refer to Note 4, “Acquisitions,” and Note 8, “Equity Method and Other Investments,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Our business supporting the life sciences market provided approximately 43% of our revenue in fiscal 2019.
We believe the life science market is generally more stable than the semiconductor capital equipment market and we expect that, over the long term, it will grow at a higher rate than our semiconductor business which historically has displayed cyclical trends related to demand for capital investments. Within the life sciences business, revenue comes from storage services and genomic services that are provided to thousands of customers and are generally more predictable than the sale of automated sample storage equipment, which has historically displayed uneven sales due to large purchases and fewer customers. 
Segments
We have three operating segments aggregated into two reportable segments consisting of Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment and Brooks Life Sciences segment.

It is not unusual for these variations in sales to be up or down 10% to 20% in sequential quarters. 

5



As a result, our quarterly and yearly sales have fluctuated in this market and we expect future sales in this market will continue to fluctuate between quarters and year-over-year.
The principal markets served by the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group segment include the following:

● | Semiconductor capital equipment market
--+---------------------------------------

Each year, the global semiconductor industry makes significant capital investments in equipment to keep up with advancements in semiconductor technology, to add manufacturing capacity and to improve productivity within existing fabs. We are recognized as a market leader in three critical sub-segments: vacuum automation for wafer handling; contamination control; and wafer automation for advanced packaging. As discussed above, the global semiconductor capital equipment industry is cyclical, but we believe that it possesses a long-term growth profile driven by the demand for increasingly sophisticated consumer electronics, automotive and smart appliance products, growth in data centers, the expansion of the Internet-of-Things which increasingly connects various appliances and devices to servers, and mobile communications infrastructure such as 5G. The demand for higher performance, lower power consumption and reduced size for all of these products is enabled by advancements in the technology and processes used for the manufacturing of the devices. We believe this trend continues to provide market opportunities for the Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group to be a valued partner in support of the industry’s needs.
We have been a long-term partner to device manufacturers and OEMs who are the providers of tools to fabs. We maintain collaborative relationships with our customers for the innovative design of solutions that enable our customers to have a valued wafer process advantage and improved cost of ownership in the fab. Our global network of technical specialists provides extensive support to our customers in all regions, including the key semiconductor markets in Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan, Europe and the United States.
The production of advanced semiconductor chips requires many complex and logistically challenging manufacturing activities. Silicon wafers must go through hundreds of process steps in order to create billions of microscopic transistors and connect them in both horizontal and vertical layers to produce a functioning integrated circuit, or IC. These initial fabrication steps, which are referred to in the industry as front-end processes, are repeated many times on a single wafer to create the desired pattern on the silicon wafer. Up to 50% of these processes are performed in tools that operate under vacuum conditions, such as removing, depositing, or measuring materials on wafer surfaces. As the complexity of semiconductors has increased, the number of process steps that occur in a vacuum environment have also increased, resulting in a greater need for vacuum automation technology solutions.
The increase in packing density of components in mobile devices has led the industry to devise advanced packaging techniques for chip interconnectivity using what is called wafer level packaging, or WLP. This advanced packaging technology is a process of combining multiple wafers together prior to cutting them into pieces and then forming them onto a packaging substrate where they are ultimately divided into the multitude of chips. The recent increased adoption of WLP has increased the need for a contaminant free and high purity manufacturing environment, resulting in higher demand for our semiconductor offerings tailored to handle full wafer forms.

We believe there is a growing demand for equipment to perform cleaning and conditioning of the wafer carriers which are used in all advanced semiconductor fabs. These cleaning tools remove microscopic particles, organic compounds and water that are attracted to the inside surface of the carrier. Automated cleaning and conditioning of the wafer carriers are also in demand as customers look to improve overall manufacturing yields. Similarly, as lithography also requires cleaner controlled environments, our reticles solutions provide contamination control for highly valued reticles or masks that are used in printing the technological features onto the wafer. 

● | Adjacent capital equipment markets
--+-----------------------------------

There are a few adjacent capital equipment markets that use manufacturing processes similar to the semiconductor manufacturing industry. These markets include microelectromechanical systems, or MEMs devices, light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, Organic Light Emitting Diodes, or OLEDs, and touch screen technology. These markets and the semiconductor capital equipment market share common customers and utilize similar technology applications. For 

6



example, LEDs are manufactured using vacuum systems and handling processes similar to those used in semiconductor manufacturing. 
We believe the desire for efficient, higher throughput and extremely clean manufacturing for semiconductor wafer fabs, the chip packaging process and other industrial or high performance electronic-based products and processes have created a substantial market for us in the following offerings: (i) substrate handling automation, which is related to moving the wafers in a semiconductor fab, (ii) tool automation, which moves wafers from station-to-station, (iii) vacuum systems technology to create and sustain the clean environment necessary for fabricating various products, and (iv) automated contamination control systems to clean and condition substrate carriers.
