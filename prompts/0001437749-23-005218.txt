ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a global public safety technology and services company organized in March 2016 delivering modern policing solutions to law enforcement and security personnel. We are a mission-driven organization focused on improving public safety encounters and outcomes. In late 2018, we commenced the sale of our initial public safety product, the BolaWrap 100 remote restraint device. In 2020, we expanded our public safety technology offerings by introducing a virtual reality training platform called Wrap Reality, which is now being sold to law enforcement and corrections departments for simulation training and societal reentry scenarios. In early 2022, we delivered an improved version of our flagship product, the BolaWrap 150, which is electronically deployed, more robust, lighter, and simpler to use compared to the BolaWrap 100s. 
 
We believe our solutions have an immediate addressable market consisting of about 900,000 full-time sworn law enforcement officers at over 18,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in the US, as well as 12.4 million police officers in more than 100 countries. Additionally, we are exploring other domestic markets such as military and private security when allowable, while also targeting countries with the largest police forces as part of our international focus. We operate in a segment of the non-lethal products global market, which is expected to reach $16.1 billion by 2027, as projected by 360iResearch, a market research consulting firm. 
 
We focus our efforts on the following products and services:
 
BolaWrap Remote Restraint Device – is a safe hand-held remote restraint device that discharges a seven and a half-foot Kevlar tether to wrap an individual at a range of 10-25 feet. BolaWrap assists law enforcement to safely detain individuals without the need for pain compliance and higher uses-of-force.
Wrap Reality – is a virtual reality training system employing immersive computer graphics with proprietary software-enabled content. It allows up to two participants to enter a simulated training environment simultaneously with customized weapon controllers that enable trainees to engage in strategic decision making along including non-use-of-force and verbal training.
 
In addition to the US law enforcement market, we have shipped our products to 59 countries. We have established an active distributor network representing 50 states and one dealer representing Puerto Rico. We have distribution agreements with 49 international distributors covering 54 countries. We focus on significant sales, training and business development efforts to support our global distribution network.
 
We allocate significant resources to research and development for product innovation and product improvement. We believe we have built a robust brand and global market presence, with notable competitive advantages in our industry. Wrap is at the forefront of designing remote restraint tools that focus on de-escalating law enforcement encounters by wrapping up a subject to prevent mobility and fighting which reduces risk of injury to the officer and to the individuals with whom they are interacting.
 
Recent Developments
 
In November 2022, the Company entered into a Professional Services and Technology Acquisition Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Lumeto, Inc. (“Lumeto”) and Spatial Industries Group, Inc. (“Spatial”), whereby Lumeto and Spatial will provide the Company certain technology, services, and perpetual licenses for use within the Company’s Wrap Reality virtual simulation training platform. The Company expects to realize the benefit of an upgraded cloud virtual reality platform as a result of the Agreement, as well as capabilities and resources to support its growth of law enforcement and corrections virtual reality training modules and enhanced capabilities. Wrap Reality’s Cloud VR platform also has significant value in the firearms safety, concealed weapons, and civilian training space in addition to law enforcement, corrections, military and private security markets.

Industry Background
 
The market for non-lethal and less-lethal products and devices serves law enforcement agencies, correctional facilities, military agencies, private security guard companies, and retail consumers. As thought leaders in new public safety products, we focus on the law enforcement agency segment of the market with our BolaWrap remote restraint solution and Wrap Reality virtual reality system. Recent events, such as the rise in mental health cases, police reform, and reorganization of police departments, have started a growing conversation on the need for de-escalation before pain-compliance policing policy across the country. As this de-escalation movement unfolds, there are thousands of law enforcement, police, and sheriff’s offices focusing on training, policies, and the use of more non-lethal restraining solutions. This movement highlights a growing need for new approaches, which we believe will drive demand for our innovative and safe law enforcement solutions.
 
When law enforcement seeks to detain an individual, there usually is a use of force continuum that an agency follows, starting with officer presence and verbal commands. If verbal commands break down, agencies may authorize the use of less lethal pain inducing compliance tools, such as pepper spray, pepper ball, wooden batons or metal collapsible batons, launchers and bean bags, and conducted energy weapons, such as Taser®. Our BolaWrap product offers an alternative. It can be used in many cases to restrain an individual after verbal commands break down and prior to the need to use pain-inducing compliance tools. The use of nonlethal solutions like BolaWrap potentially could lead to a reduction in use of force incidents that result in ending careers as well as the number of legal cases filed against agencies for excessive use of force, wrongful death, and injury, thus decreasing expensive litigation, settlements, and insurance costs.
 
We anticipate that use of the BolaWrap by public safety agencies can increase goodwill between public safety agencies and their communities, especially in a time when every interaction with public safety officers is subject to public and media scrutiny. We believe the law enforcement community’s response to BolaWrap demonstrates the need for the product and its utility in safely detaining individuals. Our goal is to equip every public safety officer with the BolaWrap remote restraint solution that they carry with them each day.
 
Markets
 
We participate in the global non-lethal market that, according to the January 2022 report by 360iResearch, was expected to grow to $16.1 billion in 2027. The following segments are our target markets:
Domestic and International Law Enforcement
 
Our products and services are primarily targeted at federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in the US. As of 2018, there were over 18,000 law enforcement agencies and 800,000 full-time local and state law enforcement officers in the US, while the US Department of Justice reported over 100,000 full-time federal officers based on 2016 data. Our product line, including BolaWrap, can be an effective tool for safe detention of individuals under the jurisdiction of these agencies.
 
We have also identified an international market opportunity of over 12.1 million police officers in the 100 largest police forces outside the US. We have delivered products to 59 countries and have entered into agreements with international distributors, with international sales representing a significant portion of our revenues in 2022. We anticipate that sales attributable to international markets will continue to represent a significant portion of our sales in the future due in part to the centralized purchase decision-making process at the national level in these markets. Often, the international markets have large national police forces. Conversely, in the US, the market is more fragmented with many smaller agencies and longer procurement and sales cycles. We expect international sales to continue to be lumpy due the timing of purchase decisions and relatively large size of orders.
 
Correctional Facilities
 
In 2019, the US Bureau of Justice statistics (“Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2019,” US Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, published November 2021) estimated that there were 240,000 correctional officers in over 1,000 federal and state correctional facilities in the US, representing a large potential market for our products and services. Most correctional facilities fall under federal, state or local law enforcement jurisdiction and we believe these facilities could leverage Wrap Reality for law enforcement and societal reentry platforms as well as BolaWrap inside and outside of the correctional facility.

Private Security Firms and Guard Services
 
According to 2019 Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates (“Occupational Employment Statistics,” US Department of Labor), there were 1.1 million privately employed security guards in the US They represent a broad range of individuals, including those employed by investigation and security services, hospitals, schools, local government, and others. We believe that some security personnel armed with the BolaWrap could be effective to de-escalate some encounters without eliminating other devices available today. Providing guards with the BolaWrap may reduce the potential liability of private security companies and personnel in such encounters.
 
Today, ATF classifications play a role in restricting Wrap's ability to transfer easily to non-government security firms. We believe the classification is overly onerous and we will continue to work with the ATF and others to change our nonlethal product's classification. We note that some of our international customer countries do not have any transfer or possession restrictions on the non-lethal BolaWrap devices and we believe this should be the future for BolaWrap.  
 
Virtual Reality Training Market
 
The virtual training and simulation market is projected to reach $602 billion by 2027, according to a 2019 report by Allied Market Research. We expect the growth of virtual reality and simulation to continue expanding into many nascent industries, including law enforcement, corrections, military, school, and private security although it currently represents a relatively small segment of the overall market. The law enforcement and military sectors are important segments of the market, and increasing awareness of the benefits of virtual training and simulation is driving market growth. Advancements in technology now enable virtual reality to recreate real-world scenarios in a 360-degree immersive environment.   
Wrap Products and Services
 
BolaWrap Remote Restraint
 
Our BolaWrap product line includes the BolaWrap 100, which was our first remote restraint product, and the BolaWrap 150, delivered to the market in Q1 of 2022. The BolaWrap 150 offers electronic deployment and is more robust, smaller, lighter, and simpler to use. The BolaWrap is a handheld remote restraint device that discharges a seven and a half-foot Kevlar tether, entangling an individual from a range of 10-25 feet. Developed in collaboration with law enforcement professionals, this device enables safe and effective control of low-force encounters, providing a valuable tool for law enforcement officers.

The BolaWrap is a remote restraint device that safely wraps around an individual's arms and/or legs to impede movement and prevent harm to themselves or others. The device provides a valuable tool for law enforcement officers to safely and humanely take subjects into custody without injury, especially when verbal commands are ignored.
 
With a wide effectiveness zone and a guiding seven dot green laser for accurate placement of the Kevlar tether, the BolaWrap mitigates the risk of injury to both the subject and officer. Its small, light, and rugged design allows officers to maintain other use of force continuum options while providing a non-lethal alternative to potentially injurious less-lethal forces or firearms.
 
BolaWrap's effectiveness in restraining individuals and hindering their ability to flee or fight has been proven. Not only does it allow officers to act safely and effectively in difficult situations by minimizing the need for other uses of force, including hand-to-hand combat and other more injurious less lethal or lethal weapons, but also it helps minimize injury and prevent the force frenzy that can occur after chasing a fleeing subject.
 
Unlike other less-lethal tools that rely on pain compliance and may lead to escalation of incidents and serious injuries, the BolaWrap does not rely on pain or electricity-enabled neuromuscular incapacitation. BolaWrap does not induce paralyzed falls or recovery time, making the BolaWrap an ideal non-lethal tool for law enforcement officers. The fight or flight response that comes from less lethal tools that cause pain and injury is minimized by being wrapped by a BolaWrap device.
 
We spend significant resources training law enforcement on the safe and effective use of the BolaWrap in conjunction with de-escalation and apprehension techniques. However, like any restraining action, some injuries may result from the use of BolaWrap or because of its use. Our training includes primary use cases that fall into the three broad categories routinely encountered by law enforcement and security personnel:
 

● | To remotely restrain and limit the mobility of an individual who is experiencing a mental health crisis, narcotics-induced psychosis, or other crisis condition rendering them incapable of responding to law enforcement’s verbal commands but that presents a danger to law enforcement, the public or themselves if not restrained;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To remotely restrain and limit the mobility of an individual attempting to evade arrest or questioning, as well as individuals ignoring verbal commands from law enforcement. These individuals are commonly referred to as passively resistant or non-compliant; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To assist in subduing individuals actively resisting arrest by limiting mobility, possibly making other engagement options less risky to officers and less injurious to individuals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Law enforcement encounters involving individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis can be challenging, resulting in public controversy and costly consequences. The Treatment Advocacy Center: Office of Research & Public Affairs reported that one in ten police encounters involve individuals with mental illness, with at least one in four fatal police encounters involving individuals with mental illness (Overlooked in the Undercounted: The Role of Mental Illness in Fatal Law Enforcement Encounters (2015)).
 
A field deployment should be considered successful by law enforcement agencies if compliance is achieved, and no additional higher-level use of force tool is required after the BolaWrap is displayed or used. Agencies have reported achieving compliance by utilizing the BolaWrap in the following ways:
 

● | By pointing the BolaWrap’s seven dot green line dot laser at the suspect in conjunction with verbal commands
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Via the sound emitted by the BolaWrap upon deployment and causing a distraction
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Through the feeling of being wrapped and/or restraint of the Kevlar cord around the suspect’s legs, arms, or torso
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | When used in conjunction with other less-lethal tools
--+------------------------------------------------------

 
While we encourage all law enforcement agencies to fill out a Use of Device Report when the BolaWrap is used during an encounter in the field, agencies do not always report all field deployments. Some agencies consider the deployment of the BolaWrap to be a non-use of force or a de minimis use of force that does not require any reporting. While some deployments have been captured on bodycam and shared with the public, others were reported by the agency or the media but were not captured on bodycam. Some agencies capture deployments on body worn cameras but do not allow the sharing of the video or allow them to be shared for learning purposes but not publicized for other marketing purposes. Some local jurisdictions have department policies, collective bargaining agreements, and city, county or state laws regarding the distribution of body worn camera video.

As more agencies incorporate the BolaWrap onto their duty belts and carry it every day on shift we expect to see an increase in the rate of field deployments, which we believe will contribute to even further adoption of the device by law enforcement agencies worldwide. In 2022, following the release of our strategic roadmap in mid Q3, we focused our customer service team on modifying their approach to become a customer success operation. As part of this strategic change, our team focuses on reaching out to drive agency wide adoption. We made this pivot in part because many agencies in the first few years of BolaWrap only deployed a small number of trial units without the immediate follow-up to grow their deployment to agency-wide. We have trained our sales team to focus on agency-wide deployment to drive the highest level of immediate success with the device and to integrate it into department-wide use of force polices. In January 2023, we launched our Use of Force Reduction Guarantee whereby we will buy back an agency’s devices when they deploy agency wide and do not see a reduction in Use –of -Force by at least 10%, after meeting certain criteria.
 
BolaWrap 150
 
In late Q1 2022, we delivered the latest generation of our BolaWrap device, the BolaWrap 150. Production of the previous model, the BolaWrap 100, ceased in 2021. We intend to continue to supply cartridges for the BolaWrap 100 to our customers for the foreseeable future. Unlike the BolaWrap 100, the BolaWrap 150 utilizes cassettes that are unique to the device and cannot be interchanged between models. We have declared that the BolaWrap 150 will be our primary product and will be supported for 5 to 10 years from the product launch date.
 
To support the increased production volume for the BolaWrap 150, we implemented a more automated supply chain in the production, quality control, and testing lines in 2022.
 
We believe the BolaWrap 150 offers important benefits, including:
 

● | Modern electronic deployment
--+-----------------------------


● | Smaller size and less weight
--+-----------------------------


● | Reduced production costs
--+-------------------------


● | LED status indicator for ease of operation
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Long laser battery life
--+------------------------


● | LED target illumination to improve accuracy
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Hardened plastic for increased durability
--+------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced water resistance for harsh environments
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
The BolaWrap 150 employs two micro-gas generators to individually expel each entangling projectile. Micro-gas generators are micro explosive parts used in a variety of industrial products, including automobile airbags.
 
See “Risk Factors” included below in this Annual Report for additional information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with our business.
 
Wrap Reality
 
In 2019, we partnered with an independent technology company to create a virtual reality system with training scenarios. We acquired NSENA Inc. in December 2020, a provider of law enforcement training employing immersive computer graphics virtual reality with proprietary software-enabled content. We branded the system as Wrap Reality Virtual Training and kept building and improving that platform and today it offers 38 built out scenarios targeting law enforcement. Countless additional scenarios can be made by using the Wrap Reality adapt functionality to pick and choose key components to build a scenario. It takes advantage of some of the most advanced virtual reality hardware available and allows up to two participants to enter the simulated training environment simultaneously.
 
In August 2021, we announced the development of an expanded Wrap Reality Virtual Training platform with a collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS). This new platform combines our law enforcement simulator with secure cloud services to track training progress and provide the ability to replay recorded training sessions. We continue to upgrade scenarios and develop de-escalation techniques into new scenarios and seek to enhance the Wrap Reality experience through continued software and platform innovation.

Additionally, we entered into a Professional Services and Technology Acquisition Agreement with Lumeto and Spatial in November 2022, which is expected to provide the Company with an upgraded cloud virtual reality platform, capabilities, and resources to support the growth of law enforcement and corrections virtual reality training modules and enhanced capabilities.
 
We are optimistic about the potential for future growth of WRAP Reality by public safety agencies, given our early adoption and deployment of robust virtual reality training technology. By leveraging our existing platform and our investment in cloud software with the Lumeto Acquisition, we now will have the opportunity to develop and offer critical training scenarios at very competitive price points.
 
We have the ability to offer both on-premises and full cloud capabilities with multiple hardware options. This expansion enables us to deliver the platform to a broad range of customers, including law enforcement agencies, public and private security, corrections and the general public for firearms, concealed weapon, and safety training.

Selling, Marketing and Training
 
Our sales, marketing and training organizations work together closely to drive revenue growth by enhancing market awareness of our solutions, generating leads, building a strong sales pipeline, and cultivating customer and distributor relationships. Our training not only supports our sales, but it also provides revenue due to the extreme value our customers place on our training services. We started charging for our training services in Q3 of 2022.
Sales
 
Our primary target market is law enforcement agencies in the US and globally. The purchasing decision for our BolaWrap products and accessories is typically made by a group including agency heads, procurement, training staff, and use of force experts, and may involve political decision-makers such as city council members. The decision-making process may take several weeks to over a year due to budget constraints and other distractions.
 
We use product demonstrations as a primary sales tool and follow up with sales activities. Our goal is to convert demonstration and training deliveries into sales and long-term expansion. We provide fee-based training services to agencies, as we believe that departments with knowledgeable instructors are more likely to purchase our products.
 
In 2019, we adopted a channel distribution approach, in tandem with our internal sales team, where we supply our products to independent regional police equipment distributors, who in turn sell to local law enforcement agencies. Our current focus is on cultivating partnerships with major agencies and providing active assistance to our distributors through our dedicated sales, business development, and support teams. We sell through distributors in most cases and go direct to our end customers where the right distributor skill set, and capability is not available.
 
We currently have distribution agreements with a network of distributors representing 50 states and one dealer representing Puerto Rico. These agreements provide certain territorial rights to distributors and allow us to sell direct to certain agencies under certain terms.
 
We have distribution agreements with 49 international distributors covering 54 countries. These agreements are generally requiring minimum sales and follow up performance and allow us to sell direct to customers subject if performance is not being met. We focus significant sales and business development efforts to support our international distributors.
 
We have invested in training our sales, distribution, demonstration, training, and customer success teams, as well as our distributors, to build awareness and drive sales of our BolaWrap and our Wrap Reality virtual reality training product. Additionally, we are actively seeking partnerships with other organizations to further enhance our sales, marketing, and technology efforts. We engage with other industry experts to ensure our virtual reality scenarios align with industry standards of engagement. 
 
Marketing
 
Prospective customers become aware of Wrap solutions through a variety of marketing channels such as social media, paid advertising, media coverage, press releases, web searches, sales calls, and public relations. We also distribute body and dash camera videos of successful BolaWrap use in policing encounters to generate leads. Once a lead is generated, it is qualified by our inside sales team, and a sales representative or distributor communicates with the prospective customer to discuss their needs and the solutions we offer.
 
We track our marketing and sales activities to provide immediate insight into activities, leads, quotes, and pipeline opportunities. Our marketing staff engages with law enforcement agencies, personnel, and risk management organizations to educate them on the benefits of BolaWrap remote restraint, as well as Wrap Reality and we participate in various domestic and international trade shows and conferences to promote our brands. We intend to increase the use of our trademarks throughout our product distribution chain to enhance brand awareness and believe our strong reputation as a pioneer in remote restraint, with excellent training and product support, gives us a competitive edge.

Demonstration, Training and Customer Success
 
As part of its sales and marketing activities, the company has a department dedicated to conducting demonstrations and training. The company offers in-person, webinar, and online demonstrations, as well as paid use of force and de-escalation training, to law enforcement agencies. The training can take place before or after the initial or subsequent purchase or deployment of the company's products. The company believes that providing training and demonstrations to law enforcement officers and trainers increases their support for purchasing and deploying the products within their departments.
 
Generally, agencies will adapt their use of force policy to take remote restraint and the BolaWrap into a key new area of their policy for non-invasive tools that did not previously exist. BolaWrap is typically not a categorical use of force, or if classified as force, is typically at the lowest level on a department policy, below all other less lethal weapons like pepper spray, pepperball, batons, bean bags, Tasers® and conducted energy weapons. We have developed and offer robust training and class materials that certify law enforcement officers and trainers as BolaWrap Instructors in the use of the BolaWrap solution.
 
In order to provide comprehensive training and sales support, we initiated the Wrap "Train the Trainer" program in October 2018. The program is structured such that our Master BolaWrap Instructors educate BolaWrap Instructors at local agencies, who then train front-line officers in compliance with the agency's policies.
 
BolaWrap Instructors are typically sworn law enforcement officers, who are commonly department trainers, defensive tactic instructors, or SWAT officers. They undergo a five-hour BolaWrap Instructor certification course, which includes passing a written exam and demonstrating proficiency in deploying and using the BolaWrap. We provide support to the instructors to share lessons learned and best practices for teaching line officers in the use of BolaWrap. Instructor certification is valid for two years and requires renewal afterward. BolaWrap training curriculum is submitted by departments to their Post Officers Standards and Training (POST) for credit for in-service training hours. Most departments who leverage the BolaWrap across all field officers incorporate BolaWrap training into most other training materials and in service training throughout the year. An example would be officers doing an in-service training on Driving under the Influence (DUI) arrests being updated on BolaWrap and practice using the BolaWrap during the arrest portion of training on individuals under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If departments are conducting in-service training on responding to those in a mental health crisis, they also need to train and have ongoing practice on deploying BolaWrap on those in crisis and practice taking these individuals safely into protective custody. Another in service training example would be when departments practice warrant service, and during the arrest and apprehension efforts, they leverage BolaWrap after verbal commands breakdown but before they are justified in using pain compliance tools such as pepper spray, pepperball, batons, Tasers or conducted electrical weapons.
 
In order to schedule and organize training events, registration, and training records, we utilize a cloud-based software system called the Wrap Learning Management System. This system is also home to a Resource Library which we highly encourage distributors and purchasers to use to educate themselves on the use of BolaWrap. 
 
In the modern world of policing, we understand that it is crucial to provide equipment and services that are well-supported, and that officers receive proper training and procedures to perform their duties effectively and safely. As a result, we have developed a professional team dedicated to training and sales support, as well as the necessary systems to provide this support. This approach not only gives us a competitive edge but also creates a significant barrier to new competition. We are confident that our training and support teams are equipped to assist agencies of all sizes.
 
Our Strategy
 
In the world of law enforcement, defense, public safety, and security, our product and training solutions are gaining recognition and worldwide awareness. We have a strong global brand and product foundation that we are continuously expanding to reach new markets and customers, thereby contributing to significant business growth. We are confident that we can capitalize on the growing demand for non-lethal policing in the world, particularly as non-compliant individuals continue to pose a threat. Our training programs and virtual reality platform are also well positioned to grow rapidly in global markets.

Our commercialization strategy concentrates on the immediate addressable domestic market, comprising more than 18,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, with approximately 900,000 full-time sworn officers in just the US alone. We also aim to target the 100 largest police forces internationally, which have over 12 million police officers. Our objective is to unlock the full potential of our technology solutions suite, which targets law enforcement and security personnel on a global scale.
 
In the coming year of 2023, we plan to maintain financial prudence and deliver value to our shareholders. Our focus will remain on expanding our revenues through pursuing business opportunities both domestically and internationally. In addition to enhancing our current product portfolio, we aim to develop new and improved products, which can be utilized by security personnel and related professionals. We also seek to pursue strategic business initiatives and collaborations, including potential acquisitions, to complement our existing offerings and sales network.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
Manufacturing
 
We believe that maintaining scalable assembly capabilities is crucial to the performance of our products and the growth of our business. Our assembly processes involve unique systems and materials, and we contract with third-party suppliers to produce various parts, components, and subassemblies. We established initial startup production in Las Vegas in 2018, and in October 2019, we completed a move and began production at our current facility in Arizona. In this facility, we perform manufacturing, final assembly, testing, and shipping of our products. We have refined our internal processes to improve how we design, test, and qualify products, and we continue to implement rigorous manufacturing and quality processes to track production and field issues. We periodically implement design and component changes to reduce our product costs and improve product reliability and manufacturability. We aim to continually improve our operations to meet the growing demand for our products and better serve our customers.
Suppliers
 
We have established strong relationships with our key suppliers, and their timely and reliable delivery is crucial to our ability to meet customer demand. However, we are subject to challenges in our global supply chain, such as component shortages, increased lead times, cost fluctuations, and logistics constraints, which can affect our production schedules and have a negative impact on our financial performance. In late 2022, we have started to ensure we have more final product inventory on hand to meet new business needs. While we anticipate supply chain challenges to improve in 2023, we recognize that future supplier shortages and logistics issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
Backlog
 
At December 31, 2022, we had backlog of approximately $257 thousand expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2023. The amount of backlog at any point in time is dependent upon order timing, scheduled delivery dates to our customers and product lead times. Most orders are shipped shortly after order and backlog is typically associated with larger police agency orders. Because of our history of shipping shortly after order, we do not currently believe backlog at any period end is predictive of future order volume or revenues beyond the reported amount. Distributor and customer orders for future deliveries are generally subject to modification, rescheduling or in some instances, cancellation in the normal course of business.
Warranties
 
Our products come with a warranty that guarantees their quality and performance for up to one year from the date of purchase. This warranty is generally limited and may include certain shipping costs for the customer. We also offer the option for our customers to purchase additional one-year warranty increments for their products.

Competition
 
Our company positions the BolaWrap product as a new non-invasive remote restraint solution for law enforcement rather than a replacement for other devices currently in use. When looking at the use of force continuum we place our solution in a category completely separate from common less lethal solutions that use pain compliance and can cause serious injuries or even death in some circumstance. We believe every law enforcement officer in the world who carries handcuffs should carry a BolaWrap at the same time. BolaWrap is leveraged just prior to handcuffs, and we are doing everything we can to educate the public and agencies about the important need to adopt this critical non-invasive and safe tool.
 
However, we do compete with other use of force products for budget allocations. The BolaWrap product may also be perceived as an alternative to other solutions despite our valuable and separate positioning. Because the BolaWrap will likely be used so much more often than all of the other tools combined, we believe we stand in a category of our own.
 
Indirectly, other use of force devices such as tasers (CEWs), pepper spray, pepperball, batons, and impact weapons may try to compete with the BolaWrap product. However, many law enforcement personnel consider these to be distinct tools, each best-suited to a particular set of higher use of force circumstances. Purchasing one tool does not preclude the purchase of others, but budgetary considerations and space limitations on officer’s belts may limit the number of devices purchased and carried. The BolaWrap's unique remote restraint use, effectiveness, and low possibility of injury positions it as an effective competitor against all other alternatives. We believe that in time the non-invasive BolaWrap will be prioritized over these other less lethal devices for its ease of use, safety, and high probability of use throughout a given year to officers in the field.
 
In the virtual reality training space, there are numerous competitors offering simulators for law enforcement, including established video-based 2D simulators. Furthermore, other virtual reality providers and developers focused on other applications may choose to compete in the law enforcement training market in the future.
 
We recognize that some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to devote to compete in the law enforcement market and may introduce products with features and performance competitive to our product. However, we believe that our unique positioning, strong product and technology foundation, and dedicated professional training and sales support team provide a competitive advantage.
 
Overall, we are extremely impressed with the depth and capability of our 3D Virtual Reality (VR) Wrap Reality Capability. We have 38 fully formed law enforcement scenarios and 25 corrections and societal reentry scenarios in 3D plus the customizability of Wrap Reality Adapt which we believe provides more robust 3D options than the competitive. The largest capitalized competitor in space currently offers only three 3D scenarios and is selling subscriptions of more than six million dollars a year.
 
Government Regulation
 
As a global company, we are subject to a wide range of domestic, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as well as international laws and regulations regarding shipments, customs, import, export, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, and hazardous substances disposal. Compliance with these laws and regulations may entail significant costs, and failure to comply may result in penalties or other enforcement actions.
 
Our BolaWrap products are classified as firearms and AOWs by the ATF, and we hold the necessary licenses to manufacture and deal in such firearms. We believe these devices have been classified as AOW due to the lack of updates to outdated statutes and implementing firearms regulations. We are actively working to improve the legislation and to allow our products to be directly transferred to private security forces and private individuals due to its safe effective capabilities standing alone in the non-invasive non-lethal category.
 
We are also subject to state and international regulations, which may vary. We comply with shipping regulations for dangerous goods, and our products comply with standard safety requirements in the US and international markets. We follow data protection laws and have a privacy policy in place. We work with distributors and advisors familiar with applicable import regulations in our international markets.

We have a policy of protecting our intellectual property assets, which include issued domestic and international patents, pending patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual obligations. We enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and third parties to whom we disclose proprietary information. These agreements prohibit disclosure of confidential information both during and after the duration of the working relationship. However, we recognize that such agreements may not always prevent disclosure or provide adequate remedies for any breach. We rely on copyrights, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights to protect the content of our training services, including the Wrap Reality VR training software and content.
 
We believe that strong product offerings that are continually upgraded and enhanced, combined with factors such as innovation, technological expertise, and experienced personnel, will keep us competitive. Therefore, we seek patent and other intellectual property protection on important technological improvements that we make. Before filing for patents, we disclose key features to patent counsel and maintain these features as trade secrets prior to product introduction. However, patent applications may not result in issued patents covering all important claims, and there is a risk that they could be denied in their entirety.
 
We currently have nineteen issued US patents related to the BolaWrap technology and eight additional US patents pending. In September 2018, we commenced filing our foreign patent applications targeting the European Union (38 countries) and seventeen other countries, of which thirty-four have been issued to date. To date we have a total of 53 issued domestic and international patents for our small global company. During 2022 we filed thirty-three patent applications, two of which were US filings. We feel the significant investment in patent protection in the US and abroad creates a significant amount of IP and value in Wrap Technologies. The failure to obtain patent protection or the loss of patent protection on our existing and future technologies or the circumvention of our patents by competitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete successfully.
 
We have been granted trade name protection for “BolaWrap” and “Wrap” in multiple countries and expect to employ a combination of registered and common law trade names, trademarks and service marks in our business. We rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and technologies, including contractual obligations, and we intend to pursue a policy of vigorously enforcing such rights.
 
The law enforcement product and services industries are characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Others, including academic institutions and competitors, hold numerous patents in less lethal and related technologies. Although we are not aware of any existing patents that would materially inhibit our ability to commercialize our technology, others may assert claims in the future. Such claims, with or without merit, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development initiatives are led by our internal personnel and make use of specialized consultants when necessary. These initiatives include basic research, mechanical and electrical engineering design and testing. Future development projects will focus on new versions of the BolaWrap technology, virtual reality and new public safety technologies that focus on safe and effective policing, especially in our strategic space that does not use pain compliance.
 
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we spent approximately $5.1 million and $6.2 million, respectively, on company-sponsored research and development. This equates to 63% of revenue in 2022 and 80% of revenue in 2021. Future levels of research and development expenditure will vary depending on the timing of further new product development and the availability of funds to carry on new and additional research and development on currently owned technologies or in other areas. During 2023 in addition to continued development and enhancement of our remote restraint products we expect to incur additional costs improving our training systems including enhancing our Wrap Reality on premise and cloud platforms and related content. As mentioned earlier we believe we are ahead of many in the law enforcement 3D virtual reality training space and have built up significant capability to compete globally in the law enforcement and corrections VR space.

Related Party License and Royalties
 
We are obligated to pay royalties pursuant to an exclusive Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2016, with Syzygy Licensing, LLC (“Syzygy”), a private technology invention, consulting and licensing company owned and controlled by Elwood G. Norris, a founder and former officer and current stockholder of the Company, and James A. Barnes, a former officer and stockholder of the Company. Syzygy has no ongoing operations, and does not engage in any manufacturing, production or other related activities.
 
The agreement provides for the payment of royalties of 4% of revenue from products employing the licensed device technology up to the earlier to occur of (i) the payment by the Company of an aggregate of $1.0 million in royalties, or (ii) September 30, 2026. All development and patent costs have been paid by us and patent applications and the technology related to the BolaWrap 100 and the BolaWrap 150 have been completely and solely assigned to the Company, subject to this royalty obligation. As of December 31, 2022 $720 thousand have been paid out under this royalty obligation leaving a maximum of $280 thousand to be paid out in the future.
 
Seasonality
 
We do find that local and international law enforcement does have seasonality in how they purchase and expend funds. Many local law enforcement agencies in the US are on a July 1 to June 30th calendar year resulting in increased spending in Q3 and Q4 of the fiscal year. The US federal government is on an October 1 to September 30th budget year resulting in use or loose spending that often occurs in Q3 of the fiscal year. Some domestic and international budgets are on a calendar fiscal year resulting in Q4 typically being the largest buying quarter of the year.
