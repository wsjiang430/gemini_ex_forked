Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General

ChoiceOne Financial Services, Inc. (“ChoiceOne” or the “Company”) is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”). The Company was incorporated on February 24, 1986, as a Michigan corporation. The Company was formed to create a bank holding company for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of ChoiceOne Bank (the “Bank”), which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company on April 6, 1987. Effective November 1, 2006, the Company merged with Valley Ridge Financial Corp. (“VRFC”), a one-bank holding company for Valley Ridge Bank (“VRB”). In December 2006, VRB was consolidated into the Bank. The Bank owns all of the outstanding common stock of ChoiceOne Insurance Agencies, Inc., an independent insurance agency headquartered in Sparta, Michigan (the “Insurance Agency”).
 
The Company’s business is primarily concentrated in a single industry segment - banking. The Bank is a full-service banking institution that offers a variety of deposit, payment, credit and other financial services to all types of customers. These services include time, savings, and demand deposits, safe deposit services, and automated transaction machine services. Loans, both commercial and consumer, are extended primarily on a secured basis to corporations, partnerships and individuals. Commercial lending covers such categories as business, industry, agricultural, construction, inventory and real estate. The Bank’s consumer loan department makes direct and indirect loans to consumers and purchasers of residential and real property. No material part of the business of the Company or the Bank is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers, the loss of which would have a materially adverse effect on the Company.
 
The Bank’s primary market area lies within Kent, Muskegon, Newaygo, and Ottawa counties in Michigan in the communities where the Bank’s offices are located. The Bank serves these markets through fourteen full-service offices. The Bank opened two full-service offices in 2018. The Company and the Bank have no foreign assets or income except for foreign debt securities.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had consolidated total assets of $670.5 million, net loans of $404.4 million, total deposits of $577.0 million and total shareholders’ equity of $80.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized consolidated net income of $7.3 million. The principal source of revenue for the Company and the Bank is interest and fees on loans. On a consolidated basis, interest and fees on loans accounted for 64%, 60%, and 59% of total revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Interest on securities accounted for 14%, 13%, and 13% of total revenues in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. For more information about the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, see the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Competition

The Bank’s competition primarily comes from other financial institutions located within Kent, Muskegon, Newaygo, and Ottawa counties in western Michigan. There are a number of larger commercial banks within the Bank’s primary market area. The Bank also competes with a large number of other financial institutions, such as savings and loan associations, insurance companies, consumer finance companies, credit unions, internet banks and other financial technology companies, and commercial finance and leasing companies for deposits, loans and service business. Money market mutual funds, brokerage houses and nonfinancial institutions provide many of the financial services offered by the Bank. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than the Bank. The principal methods of competition for financial services are price (the rates of interest charged for loans, the rates of interest paid for deposits and the fees charged for services) and the convenience and quality of services rendered to customers.
Supervision and Regulation 

Banks and bank holding companies are extensively regulated. The Company is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”). The Company’s activities are generally limited to owning or controlling banks and engaging in such other activities as the Federal Reserve Board may determine to be closely related to banking. Prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and in some cases various other government agencies, is required for the Company to acquire control of any additional bank holding companies, banks or other operating subsidiaries. Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support it.
 
The Bank is chartered under state law and is subject to regulation by the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (“DIFS”). State banking laws place restrictions on various aspects of banking, including permitted activities, loan interest rates, branching, payment of dividends and capital and surplus requirements. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and is also subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) to the maximum extent provided by law. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which provides certain advantages to the Bank, including favorable borrowing rates for certain funds.
 
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company’s primary source of funds available to pay dividends to shareholders is dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank can lend or otherwise supply funds to the Company. In addition, payment of dividends to the Company by the Bank is subject to various state and federal regulatory limitations.
 
The FDIC formed the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (“Reform Act”) to create a stronger and more stable insurance system. The FDIC maintains the insurance reserves of the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The DIF insures deposit accounts of the Bank up to a maximum amount of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. FDIC insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance premiums based on the risk an institution poses to the DIF. In February 2011, the FDIC finalized rules, effective for assessments occurring after April 1, 2011, which redefined an institution’s assessment base as average consolidated total assets minus average Tier 1 capital. The new rules also established the initial base assessment rate for Risk Category 1 institutions, such as the Bank, at 5 to 9 basis points (annualized). Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC amended its rules to eliminate Risk Categories for small banks, replacing them with a method based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating and several financial ratios. On that date, the Bank’s initial base assessment rate was reduced to 3 basis points, since the Federal Deposit Insurance Reserve Ratio reached 1.15% as of June 30, 2016.
 
The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) to impose periodic assessments on all depository institutions. The purpose of these periodic assessments is to spread the cost of the interest payments on the outstanding FICO bonds issued to recapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund (“SAIF”) over a larger number of institutions.
 
The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to promote the safety and soundness of federally-insured depository institutions. These guidelines establish standards for, among other things, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
 
The Company and the Bank are subject to regulatory “risk-based” capital guidelines. Failure to meet these capital guidelines could subject the Company or the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting brokered deposits, and other restrictions on its business. In addition, the Bank would generally not receive regulatory approval of any application that requires the consideration of capital adequacy, such as a branch or merger application, unless it could demonstrate a reasonable plan to meet the capital requirement within a reasonable period of time.

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. In addition, if DIFS deems the Bank’s capital to be impaired, DIFS may require the Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment on the Company as the Bank’s sole shareholder. If the Company fails to pay any assessment, the Company’s directors will be required, under Michigan law, to sell the shares of the Bank’s stock owned by the Company to the highest bidder at either a public or private auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore the Bank’s capital.
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (“FDICIA”) requires, among other things, federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA sets forth the following five capital categories: “well-capitalized,” “adequately-capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly-undercapitalized” and “critically-undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures as established by regulation, which include Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratio measures and a leverage capital ratio measure.  Under certain circumstances, the appropriate banking agency may treat a well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, or undercapitalized institution as if the institution were in the next lower capital category.
 
Federal banking regulators are required to take specified mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must generally appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. An institution in any of the undercapitalized categories is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from paying any dividends, increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches, accepting or renewing any brokered deposits or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval.
 
On July 3, 2013, the FDIC Board of Directors approved the Regulatory Capital Interim Final Rule, implementing Basel III.  This rule redefines Tier 1 capital as two components (Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1), creates a new capital ratio (Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio) and implements a capital conservation buffer. It also revises the prompt corrective action thresholds and makes changes to risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. The Bank was required to transition into the new rule beginning on January 1, 2015.
 
Banks are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, which have a material impact on their business. These include, among others, minimum capital requirements, state usury laws, state laws relating to fiduciaries, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, electronic funds transfer laws, redlining laws, predatory lending laws, antitrust laws, environmental laws, money laundering laws and privacy laws. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board may influence the growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and may also affect interest rates on loans and deposits. These policies may have a significant effect on the operating results of banks.
 
In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to the business of banking. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activities that are financial in nature or complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments.
 
In order for the Company to maintain financial holding company status, both the Company and the Bank must be categorized as “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulatory guidelines. If the Company or the Bank ceases to meet these requirements, the Federal Reserve Board may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements and place limitations on the Company’s ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, if the deficiencies persist, the Federal Reserve Board may require the Company to divest of the Bank. The Company and the Bank were both categorized as “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” as of December 31, 2018.

Bank holding companies may acquire banks and other bank holding companies located in any state in the United States without regard to geographic restrictions or reciprocity requirements imposed by state banking law. Banks may also establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of and mergers with other banks. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed only if specifically authorized by state law.
 
Michigan banking laws do not significantly restrict interstate banking. The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of the Department of Insurance and Financial Services, (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan.
 
Banks are subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). Under the terms of the CRA, the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial non-compliance.” The regulatory agency’s assessment of the bank’s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank’s federal regulatory agency is required to assess the CRA compliance record of any bank that has applied to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an office, or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the Federal Reserve Board will assess the CRA compliance record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company, and such compliance records may be the basis for denying the application. Upon receiving notice that a subsidiary bank is rated less than “satisfactory,” a financial holding company will be prohibited from additional activities that are permitted to be conducted by a financial holding company and from acquiring any company engaged in such activities. The Bank’s CRA rating was “Satisfactory” as of its more recent examination.
 
Effects of Compliance With Environmental Regulations

The nature of the business of the Bank is such that it holds title, on a temporary or permanent basis, to a number of parcels of real property. These include properties owned for branch offices and other business purposes as well as properties taken in or in lieu of foreclosure to satisfy loans in default. Under current state and federal laws, present and past owners of real property may be exposed to liability for the cost of cleanup of environmental contamination on or originating from those properties, even if they are wholly innocent of the actions that caused the contamination. These liabilities can be material and can exceed the value of the contaminated property. Management is not presently aware of any instances where compliance with these provisions will have a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company or the Bank, or where compliance with these provisions will adversely affect a borrower’s ability to comply with the terms of loan contracts.
Employees

As of February 28, 2019, the Company, the Bank and the Insurance Agency employed 174 employees, of which 141 were full-time employees. The Company, the Bank, and the Insurance Agency believe their overall relations with their employees are good.

Loan maturities are classified according to the contractual maturity date or the anticipated amortization period, whichever is appropriate. The anticipated amortization period is used in the case of loans where a balloon payment is due before the end of the loan’s normal amortization period. At the time the balloon payment is due, the loan can either be rewritten or payment in full can be requested. The decision regarding whether the loan will be rewritten or a payment in full will be requested will be based upon the loan’s payment history, the borrower’s current financial condition, and other relevant factors.

Total allowance | $ | 4,673 | | $ | 4,577 | | $ | 4,277 | $ | 4,194 | $ | 4,173



The higher levels in the allowance allocation to commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans was due to growth in these loan categories. The lower levels in the allocation to residential real estate loans was caused by lower historical charge-off levels. Changes in historical charge-off levels and environmental factors affected all loan categories.
 
Management periodically reviews the assumptions, loss ratios and delinquency trends in estimating the appropriate level of its allowance for loan losses and believes the unallocated portion of the total allowance was sufficient at December 31, 2018.
 
The following schedule presents the stratification of the loan portfolio by category, based on the amount of loans outstanding as a percentage of total loans for the respective years ended December 31.
