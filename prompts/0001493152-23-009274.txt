Item 1. Business
Overview
 
CEA Industries, through our subsidiary, Surna Cultivation Technologies LLC, is a company focused on selling environmental control and other technologies and services to the Controlled Environment Agriculture (“CEA”) industry. The CEA industry aims to optimize the use of horticultural resources such as water, energy, space, capital, and labor, to create an agriculture business that is more efficient and more productive than those that use traditional farming methods. Typically, the CEA industry is focused on indoor agriculture and vertical farming.
 
Headquartered in Colorado, we leverage our experience in the CEA industry to bring our customers a variety of value-added technology solutions that help improve their overall crop quality and yield, optimize energy and water efficiency, and satisfy the evolving state and local codes, permitting and regulatory requirements. We do this by offering our customers a variety of principal service and product offerings that include: (i) architectural design and licensed engineering of commercial scale thermodynamic systems specific to cultivation facilities, (ii) liquid-based process cooling systems and other climate control systems, (iii) air handling equipment and systems, (iv) air sanitation products, (v) LED lighting, (vi) benching and racking solutions for indoor cultivation, (vii) proprietary and third party controls systems and technologies used for environmental, lighting and climate control, and (viii) preventative maintenance services, through our partnership with a certified service contractor network, for CEA facilities.
 
Our revenue stream is currently derived primarily from supplying our products, services and technologies to licensed commercial indoor facilities operating in the cannabis industry. Our customers include state and provincial-regulated CEA growers located in the U.S., Canada, and other international locations. We recently have developed customers in the non-cannabis CEA market to expand our market reach. Customers use our services for building new CEA facilities and expanding or retrofitting existing CEA facilities.
 
CEA growers currently face a challenging business environment that includes high energy costs, water usage and conservation issues, continuously evolving waste removal regulations, inflationary pressures, and labor shortages. In addition to these issues, our cannabis growing customers face increasingly rigorous quality standards and declining cannabis prices in a growing industry whose standards are constantly evolving.
 
We support our clients by providing integrated mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (“MEP”) engineering design, proprietary and curated environmental control equipment, and automation offerings that serve the CEA industry. Over our 16 years in business, we have served hundreds of commercial indoor CEA facilities.
 
We believe our customers partner with us because we have the reputation and experience to help them make cost-conscious and effective decisions on the design and engineering of their indoor cultivation facilities. CEA facilities are resource intensive, and a growing list of states have implemented building code changes that limit energy consumption in cultivation facilities. Energy and resource efficiency is a high priority to us as engineers, and the senior engineers on our team hold the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) credential. We believe this sustainability-focused technical experience is crucial in the value we provide to our customers.
 
We have three core assets that we believe will support us as we pursue our business strategy. First, we enjoy strong relationships with relevant stakeholders in the CEA industry. Largely focused in the cannabis segment, our partnerships include relationships with new and existing growers, capital providers, consultants, independent contractors, and numerous others. These partnerships include agreements reached in 2022 with Merida Capital and Hydrobuilder Holdings LLC. In June we announced a marketing arrangement with Merida Capital, a cannabis-focused private equity firm, whereby Merida will use CEA Industries Inc. as its sole provider of certain products and services for its indoor cultivation facilities. This relationship resulted in a new contract in October 2022 with one of Merida’s Connecticut based clients. In November of 2022 we announced a strategic alliance with Hydrobuilder Holdings that we believe will result in more project opportunities.
 
Second, our experience in this industry over time has built up specialized engineering know-how and experience. We have been serving indoor cultivators since 2006 and designing CEA cultivation facilities since 2016. Since then, we have tested and solidified best practices from designing environmental control systems for CEA cultivation facilities.

Third, we have a line of proprietary environmental control products that support the specific growing environments that our customers want. We believe these products offer significant benefits to our customers.
 
Shares of our common stock and warrants are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Markets under the ticker symbols “CEAD” and “CEADW”, respectively.
 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Business
 
As a result of the government measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic, there continue to be disruptions in business operations around the world, with a persistent impact on our business.
 
We still are experiencing delays with our international supply of products and shipments from vendors. While these delays have improved in recent months, we, along with many other importers of goods across all industries, continue to experience supply chain disruption. Also, shipping times are still longer than they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to work diligently with our network of freight partners and suppliers to expedite delivery dates and provide solutions to reduce further impact and delays. However, we are unable to determine the full impact of these delays and how long they will continue as they are out of our control.
 
Impact of Ukrainian Conflict
 
We believe that the conflict between Ukraine and Russia does not have any direct impact on our operations, financial condition, or financial reporting. We believe the conflict will have only a general impact on our operations in the same manner as it is having a general impact on all businesses that have their operations limited to North America resulting from international sanction and embargo regulations, possible shortages of goods and goods incorporating parts that may be supplied from the Ukraine or Russia, supply chain challenges, and the international and US domestic inflation resulting from the conflict and government spending for the Ukraine and funding of our country’s response. As our operations are related only to the North American controlled agricultural industry, largely within the cannabis space, we do not believe we will be targeted for cyber-attacks related to this conflict. We have no operations in the countries directly involved in the conflict or are specifically impacted by any of the sanctions and embargoes, as we principally operate in the United States and Canada. We do not believe that the conflict will have any impact on our internal control over financial reporting. Other than general securities market trends, we do not have reason to believe that investors will evaluate the company as having special risks or exposures related to the Ukrainian conflict.
The CEA Industry
 
According to a leading market research firm, New Frontier Data, the North American cannabis industry is expected to experience compound annual growth on the order of 12% from 2022 through 2030. In addition to the cannabis CEA market the non-cannabis CEA market is also expected to experience material growth over the next years. Since the technical infrastructure and requirements for growing any plant in a controlled environment are similar, we believe we can bring our operational expertise and suite of products to this adjacent market.
Our Services and Equipment Solutions
 
Our goal is to develop relationships with our prospects and customers that will afford us the opportunity to provide comprehensive services and equipment for the complete lifecycle of indoor agriculture facilities. This lifecycle includes designing and engineering the facility, providing the many required infrastructure technologies, advising on and ensuring proper installation of the technologies, providing training and start-up support, and ultimately providing preventative and other ongoing services for ensuring proper maintenance and operations.
 
We provide a comprehensive range of service solutions that include facility design and budgeting, equipment selection and specification, equipment installation advisory, and preventative maintenance services. In addition, we provide our customers with product offerings that include both proprietary products and value-added reseller (“VAR”) products.

Our Customers and Prospects
 
We provide our services and products to customers who are building, upgrading, or expanding an indoor cultivation facility for any crop. Our customers vary based on the size of the facility, type of crop being cultivated, and extent of construction or retrofitting of the facility.
 
Most of our customers are new entrants to the CEA industry and have no other cultivation facilities. Some customers have one or more facilities which we classify as MFOs (multi-facility operators), and these are our favored prospects that we pursue aggressively or who turn to us after we have served them on a previous facility. We currently do not have projects with the largest, publicly traded firms (typically referred to as “MSOs,” or Multi-State Operators).

-


MFOs are customers who already own cultivation facilities and they are our preferred customers because they are likely already successful and cash-flowing, and they understand the challenges of building a new cultivation facility. They are thus a less risky prospect with a much higher likelihood of successfully completing a project.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We have both marketing and sales employees who focus on winning business from new entrants and smaller MFOs. Through our marketing activities, we focus on generating new leads and positioning ourselves in the CEA facilities indoor cultivation market. We lead with our value proposition of offering a wide range of proprietary and curated products and services, giving more options to our customers to satisfy their individual applications and goals.
 
Our sales strategy involves reaching out to potential customers on leads developed by our marketing efforts and developing those relationships. Our sales cycle can range from several months to 18 months from first contact with a prospect to signing a contract. The sales cycles for our new build commercial projects can vary significantly depending on the size and complexity of the project. From pre-sales and technical advisory meetings to sales contract execution, to engineering and design services and equipment delivery, and all the way through installation and startup of the installed system, the full cycle can range from three months to two years. Since we do not install any of the products we sell, our customers are required to use third-party installation contractors, which adds to the variability of the sales cycle.
 
Sales, Contract, and Fulfillment Cycle
 
When a customer agrees to enter into a contract with us it can be for any or all of the following:
 

● | Architectural design services; 
--+-----------------------------------
● | MEP engineering services; 
● | Equipment provision; and 
● | Preventative maintenance. 

 
To enter into a contract, we require a 5-10% deposit and a signed contract. We then require progress payments as architectural and/or engineering work is completed, and before equipment is shipped. We generally do not ship equipment to a customer unless that equipment has been fully paid. The sales and fulfillment cycle can be summarized as follows, with elapsed time from start:
 
Start: Early meetings to understand goals and resources;
 
1-2 months: Proposal development and presentation;
 
3 months: Contract acceptance (requires 5-10% deposit);
 
3 months: Architectural and MEP engineering work begin;
 
4-5 months: Architectural and MEP engineering work completed, and equipment selections finalized (services paid for before release of construction drawings);
 
5 months: equipment ordered (40% deposit on equipment received prior to ordering);
 
6-18 months: construction project commences, equipment delivered as required (fully paid for before shipping); and
 
12-18 months: all equipment shipped and installed, project completed, operator training and system startup conducted.

Anticipated Average Project Revenues.
 
Architectural and engineering services fees per project can range from $10,000 to over $100,000, depending on the size of the project. Revenue from equipment sales on an individual projects has been as much as $3,000,000 but most typically, the per project range is from $500,000 to $1,500,000.
Our Competition
 
Our environmental control systems and our related engineering and design services compete with various national and local Mechanical, Electrical & Plumbing (MEP) engineering firms. We also compete with national and local HVACD contractors and traditional HVACD equipment suppliers who resell, design, and implement climate control systems for commercial and industrial facilities, but most of whom do not have the specific knowledge that we have about the complexities and challenges of CEA facilities. We have positioned ourselves to differ from these competitors by providing a broad range of engineering and design services and environmental control systems, across most major HVACD solutions, including chilled water systems, custom air handling units, split systems, and packaged roof-top units. Each is tailored specifically for managing the distinct challenges involved in CEA facilities. We believe our industry-specific applications and experience in the CEA market allow us to deliver the right solution to our cultivation customers. Unlike many of our competitors, our solutions are designed specifically for cultivators to provide tight temperature and humidity control, reduce bio-security risks, reduce energy requirements, and minimize maintenance complexity, costs and downtime. However, we are seeing more competitors enter the CEA market, focused on emulating the same types of crop-specific climate control systems and engineering services that we offer. We believe this increased competition may adversely impact our ability to obtain new facility projects from both MFOs and independent smaller growers and could require us to accept lower gross margins on our projects.
 
As the cannabis segment of the CEA industry continues to mature and develop and legalization becomes more prevalent, we expect to see more competition from agricultural product and service providers who seek to expand into this niche of the CEA market. Companies already operating in the non-cannabis CEA industry may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger client bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. These competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential clients, employees, strategic partners, distribution channels and advertisers. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and a potential loss of market share.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark rights, licenses, trade secrets, and laws that protect intellectual property, confidential procedures, and contractual restrictions with our employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. While we have several issued patents, we do not believe that these issued patents currently provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. We have registered trademarks around our core Surna brand in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions, as well as the Surna logo and the combined Surna logo and name in the United States. Our Surna trademark is also registered in the European Union and Canada. We also recently secured trademark registration for our proprietary SCA platform, SentryIQ, in the United States and Canada. Subject to ongoing use and renewal, trademark protection is potentially perpetual. We actively protect our inventions, new technologies, and product developments by maintaining trade secrets and, in limited circumstances, filing for patent protection.
Employees
 
We currently have 19 active full-time employees. However, we may engage, and have in the past utilized, the services of consultants, independent contractors, and other non-employee professionals. Additional employees may be hired in the future depending on need, available resources, and our achieved growth.
US Government Regulation
 
While we do not generate any revenue from the direct sale of cannabis products, we have historically, and continue to, offer our services and engineering solutions to indoor cultivators that are engaged in various aspects of the cannabis industry. Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which specific uses of marijuana have been legalized, such as medical marijuana or for adult recreational purpose, its use remains a violation of federal laws.

A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, manufacture, distribute or sell cannabis or cannabis products, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
In the past, the Obama administration took the position that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The Trump administration revised this policy but made no major changes in enforcement through Attorney General Jeffrey Sessions rescinding the Cole Memorandum. Although President Biden stood for decriminalization and descheduling during his campaign, his administration has not formulated an explicit policy on cannabis. The Biden administration has implemented pardons for past federal cannabis possession convictions and encouraged governors to do the same. Also, in May 2021 the Drug Enforcement Administration approved licensed facilities to grow cannabis for the purpose of medical research, and on December 2, 2022, President Biden signed the Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act. This act is “the first standalone marijuana-related bill approved by both chambers of the United States Congress” and allows medical marijuana research. The act requires the Drug Enforcement Administration to register researchers and suppliers of cannabis for medical research in a timely manner, who will then be able to legally manufacture, distribute, dispense and possess the substance. It also creates a mechanism for FDA approval of drugs derived from the cannabis plant and “protects doctors who may now discuss the harms and benefits of using cannabis and cannabis derivatives.” It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to investigate the medical utility of cannabis and barriers that exist to conducting research, and requires the U.S. Attorney General to conduct an annual review to ensure that cannabis is being adequately produced for research purposes. In January 2023, the FDA stated that given the growing cannabidiol (CBD) products market, it had convened a high-level internal working group to explore potential regulatory pathways for CBD products and is prepared to find a new regulatory pathway for CBD to balance individuals’ desire for access to CBD products with the regulatory oversight needed to manage risks. Notwithstanding the actions of the Biden administration, it should be expected that the Department of Justice will continue to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis under established principles in setting their law enforcement priorities to prevent:
 

● | the distribution of cannabis products, such as marijuana, to minors; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of cannabis; 
● | the diversion of cannabis products from states where it is legal under state law to states where it is not legal under state law; 
● | the use of state-authorized cannabis activity as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
● | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis products; 
● | driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health and safety consequences associated with cannabis product usage; 
● | the growing of cannabis on public lands; and 
● | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 

 
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, most federally chartered banks will not accept deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry generally bank with state-chartered banks and credit unions to provide banking to the industry.
 
In 2014, Congress passed a spending bill containing a provision (the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment and sometimes referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) blocking federal funds and resources allocated under the federal appropriations bills from being used to “prevent such States from implementing their own State medical marijuana laws.” The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, however, did not codify any federal protections for medical marijuana patients and producers operating within state law. The Justice Department maintains that it can still prosecute violations of the federal cannabis laws and continue cases already in the courts. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment must be re-enacted every year, and it is continued through September 30, 2023. However, state laws do not supersede the prohibitions set forth in the federal drug laws.

In order to participate in either the medical or the adult use aspects of the cannabis industry, all businesses and employees must obtain licenses from the state and, for businesses, local jurisdictions as well. As an example, Colorado issues four types of business licenses including cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, and testing. In addition, all owners and employees must obtain an occupational license to be permitted to own or work in a facility. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.
 
Colorado has also enacted stringent regulations governing the facilities and operations of cannabis businesses that are involved with the plant and its products. All facilities are required to be licensed by the state and local authorities and are subject to comprehensive security and surveillance requirements. In addition, each facility is subject to extensive regulations that govern its businesses practices, which includes mandatory seed-to-sale tracking and reporting, health and sanitary standards, packaging and labeling requirements, and product testing for potency and contaminants.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
