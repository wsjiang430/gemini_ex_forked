GENERAL 
 AmeriServ Financial, Inc. (the Company) is a bank holding company organized under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law. The Company became a holding company upon acquiring all of the outstanding shares of AmeriServ Financial Bank (the Bank) in January 1983. The Companys other wholly owned subsidiaries include AmeriServ Trust and Financial Services Company (the Trust Company), formed in October 1992, and AmeriServ Life Insurance Company (AmeriServ Life), formed in October 1987. When used in this report, the Company may refer to AmeriServ Financial, Inc. individually or AmeriServ Financial, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
 The Companys principal activities consist of owning and operating its three wholly owned subsidiary entities. At December 31, 2018, the Company had, on a consolidated basis, total assets, deposits, and shareholders equity of $1.2 billion, $949.2 million, and $98.0 million, respectively. The Company and its subsidiaries derive substantially all of their income from banking and bank-related services. The Company functions primarily as a coordinating and servicing unit for its subsidiary entities in general management, accounting and taxes, loan review, auditing, investment accounting, marketing and risk management. 
 As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to supervision and regular examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the PDB). The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) for matters relating to registered offerings and sales of its securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the trading symbol ASRV, and the Company is subject to the NASDAQ rules applicable to listed companies. 
 AMERISERV FINANCIAL BANKING SUBSIDIARY 
 AMERISERV FINANCIAL BANK 
 The Bank is a state bank chartered under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the Banking Code). Through 16 locations in Allegheny, Cambria, Centre, Somerset, and Westmoreland counties, Pennsylvania and Washington county, Maryland, the Bank conducts a general banking business. It is a full-service bank offering (i) retail banking services, such as demand, savings and time deposits, checking accounts, money market accounts, secured and unsecured consumer loans, mortgage loans, safe deposit boxes, holiday club accounts, money orders, and travelers checks; and (ii) lending, depository and related financial services to commercial, industrial, financial, and governmental customers, such as commercial real estate mortgage loans (CRE), short and medium-term loans, revolving credit arrangements, lines of credit, inventory and accounts receivable financing, real estate-construction loans, business savings accounts, certificates of deposit, wire transfers, night depository, and lock box services.

 We believe that the Banks deposit base is such that loss of one depositor or a related group of depositors would not have a materially adverse effect on its business. The Banks business is not seasonal, nor does it have any risks attendant to foreign sources. A significant majority of the Banks customer base is located within a 150 mile radius of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, the Banks headquarters.

RISK MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW 
 Risk identification and management are essential elements for the successful management of the Company. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various types of risk, which includes credit, interest rate and market, liquidity, operational, legal/compliance, strategic/reputational and security risk. The Company controls and monitors these risks with policies, procedures, and various levels of oversight from the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) and management. The Company has a Management Enterprise Risk Committee with Board of Director representation to help manage and monitor the Companys risk position which is reported formally to the Board on a semi-annual basis. 
 Interest rate risk is the sensitivity of net interest income and the market value of financial instruments to the magnitude, direction, and frequency of changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk results from various repricing frequencies and the maturity structure of assets and liabilities. The Company uses its asset liability management policy to control and manage interest rate risk. 
 Liquidity risk represents the inability to generate cash or otherwise obtain funds at reasonable rates to satisfy commitments to borrowers, as well as the obligations to depositors, debtholders and the funding of operating costs. The Company uses its asset liability management policy and contingency funding plan to control and manage liquidity risk. 
 Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms resulting in an economic loss to the organization. Credit risk results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into certain off-balance sheet loan funding commitments. The Companys primary credit risk occurs in the loan portfolio. The Company uses its credit policy and disciplined approach to evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses (the ALL) to control and manage credit risk. The Companys investment policy and hedging policy limit the amount of credit risk that may be assumed in the investment portfolio and through hedging activities. The following summarizes and describes the Companys various loan categories and the underwriting standards applied to each: 
 Commercial Loans 
 This category includes credit extensions to commercial and industrial borrowers. Business assets, including accounts receivable, inventory and/or equipment, typically secure these credits. The commercial loan segment also includes commercial loans secured by owner occupied real estate. In appropriate instances, extensions of credit in this category are subject to collateral advance formulas. Balance sheet strength and profitability are considered when analyzing these credits, with special attention given to historical, current and prospective sources of cash flow, and the ability of the customer to sustain cash flow at acceptable levels. The Banks policy permits flexibility in determining acceptable debt service coverage ratios. Personal guarantees are frequently required; however, as the financial strength of the borrower increases, the Banks ability to obtain personal guarantees decreases. In addition to economic risk, this category is impacted by the strength of the borrowers management, industry risk and portfolio concentration risk each of which are also monitored and considered during the underwriting process.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Commercial Loans Secured by Non-Owner Occupied Real Estate 
 This category includes various types of loans, including acquisition and construction of investment property. Maximum term, minimum cash flow coverage, leasing requirements, maximum amortization and maximum loan to value ratios are controlled by the Banks credit policy and follow industry guidelines and norms, and regulatory limitations. Personal guarantees are normally required during the construction phase on construction credits and are frequently obtained on mid to smaller CRE loans. In addition to economic risk, this category is subject to geographic and portfolio concentration risk, each of which are monitored and considered in underwriting. 
 During 2018, a more robust risk management framework was developed to enhance monitoring of the non-owner occupied commercial real estate segment of the portfolio. This analysis considers more forward looking credit metrics such as stress test results and underwriting trend data, coupled with risk tolerance and concentration guidelines. The enhanced process is intended to allow identification of emerging risk in part to determine any future change to lending policy, underwriting practices or broader lending strategy prior to any indication of performance deterioration. 
 Residential Real Estate  Mortgages 
 This category includes mortgages that are secured by residential property. Underwriting of loans within this category is pursuant to Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines, with the exception of Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) loans, which have more liberal standards. A meaningful portion of this portfolio consists of home equity loans. The major risk in this category is that a significant downward economic trend would increase unemployment and cause payment default. The Bank does not engage and has never engaged, in subprime residential mortgage lending. 
Consumer Loans 
 This category includes consumer installment loans and revolving credit plans. Underwriting is pursuant to industry norms and guidelines. The major risk in this category is a significant economic downturn. 
INVESTMENTS 
 The strategic focus of the investment securities portfolio is managed for liquidity and earnings in a prudent manner that is consistent with proper bank asset/liability management and current banking practices. The objectives of portfolio management include consideration of proper liquidity levels, interest rate and market valuation sensitivity, and profitability. The investment portfolio of the Company and its subsidiaries are proactively managed in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
 The investment portfolio is primarily made up of AAA rated agency mortgage-backed securities, high quality corporate securities, taxable municipal securities, and agency securities. Management strives to maintain a portfolio duration that is less than 60 months. All holdings must meet standards documented in its investment policy, unless otherwise approved by the Companys CEO or the Asset/Liability Management Committee. 
 Investment securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while investment securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair market value.

Secondary Market Activities 
 The residential lending department of the Bank continues to originate one-to-four family mortgage loans for customers, the majority of which are sold to outside investors in the secondary market and some of which are retained for the Banks portfolio. Mortgages sold on the secondary market are sold to investors on a flow basis; mortgages are priced and delivered on a best efforts pricing basis, with servicing released to the investor. Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac guidelines are used in underwriting all mortgages with the exception of a limited amount of CRA loans. Mortgages with longer terms, such as 20-year, 30-year, FHA, and VA loans, are usually sold. The remaining production of the department includes construction, adjustable rate mortgages, quality non-salable loans, and bi-weekly mortgages. These loans are usually kept in the Banks portfolio. New portfolio production is predominately adjustable rate mortgages.

MONETARY POLICIES 
 Commercial banks are affected by policies of various regulatory authorities including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are: open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the federal funds rate and discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and may also affect interest rate charges on loans or interest paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. 
COMPETITION 
 Our subsidiaries face strong competition from other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, and other financial or investment service institutions for business in the communities they serve. Several of these institutions are affiliated with major banking and financial

 institutions which are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Bank and the Trust Company. As the financial services industry continues to consolidate, the scope of potential competition affecting our subsidiaries will also increase. Brokerage houses, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, and pension trusts are important competitors for various types of financial services. In addition, personal and corporate trust investment counseling services are offered by insurance companies, other firms, and individuals. 
MARKET AREA & ECONOMY 
 Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where the Company is headquartered, continues to have a cost of living that is lower than the national average. Johnstown is home to The University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, Pennsylvania Highlands Community College and Conemaugh Health System. The high-tech defense industry is now the main non-health care staple of the Johnstown economy, with the region fulfilling many Federal government contracts, punctuated by one of the premier defense trade shows in the U.S., the annual Showcase For Commerce. The city also hosts annual events such as the Flood City Music Festival and the Thunder in the Valley Motorcycle Rally, which draw several thousand visitors. The Johnstown, PA MSA unemployment rate decreased from a 6.1% average in 2017 to a 5.2% average in 2018. The Johnstown, PA MSA continues to have one of the highest jobless rates among the 18 metropolitan statistical areas across the state. This coupled with a declining population trend creates a challenge moving forward. 
 Economic conditions are stronger in the State College market and have demonstrated the same improvement experienced in the national economy. The community is a college town, dominated economically and demographically by the presence of the University Park campus of the Pennsylvania State University. Happy Valley is another often-used term to refer to the State College area, including the borough and the townships of College, Harris, Patton, and Ferguson. The unemployment rate for the State College MSA decreased from a 3.7% average in 2017 to a 3.3% average in 2018 and remains one of the lowest of all regions in the Commonwealth. A large percentage of the population in State College falls into the 18 to 34 year old age group, while potential customers in the Cambria/Somerset markets tend to be over 50 years of age. 
 Hagerstown in Washington County, Maryland offers a rare combination of business advantages providing a major crossroads location that is convenient to the entire East Coast at the intersection of I-81 and I-70. It has a workforce of over 400,000 with strengths in manufacturing and technology. It also offers an affordable cost of doing business and living, all within an hour of the Washington, D.C./Baltimore regions. There are also plenty of facilities and land slated for industrial/commercial development. Hagerstown has become a choice location for manufacturers, financial services, and distribution companies. The Hagerstown, MD-Martinsburg, WV MSA unemployment rate increased from a 3.7% average in 2017 to a 4.3% average in 2018. 
 The Company also has loan production offices in Wilkins Township in Allegheny County and Altoona in Blair County, Pennsylvania. Wilkins Township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania is located 15 miles east of the city of Pittsburgh. While the city is historically known for its steel industry, today its economy is largely based on healthcare, education, technology and financial services. The city of Pittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University and the University of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is rich in art and culture. Pittsburgh museums and cultural sites include the Andy Warhol Museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Frick Art & Historical Center, and Pittsburgh Center for the Arts among numerous others. Pittsburgh is also the home of the Pirates, Steelers and Penguins. The unemployment rate for the Pittsburgh MSA decreased from a 5.0% average in 2017 to a 4.3% average in 2018. 
 Altoona is the business center of Blair County, Pennsylvania with a strong retail, government and manufacturing base. The top field of employment in Altoona and the metro area is healthcare. Its location along I-99 draws from a large trade area over a wide geographic area that extends to State College and Johnstown. It serves as the headquarters for Sheetz Corporation, which ranks on Forbes list of the top privately owned companies. In addition to being located adjacent to I-99 and a major highway system, Altoona also has easy access to rail and air transportation. The unemployment rate in the Altoona MSA decreased from a 4.8% average in 2017 to a 4.2% average in 2018.

INDUSTRY REGULATION 
 The banking and trust industry, and the operation of bank holding companies, is highly regulated by federal and state law, and by numerous regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies and state banking agencies. Bank regulation affects all aspects of conducting business as a bank, including such major items as minimum capital requirements, limits on types and amounts of investments, loans and other assets, as well as borrowings and other liabilities, and numerous restrictions or requirements on the loan terms and other products made available to customers, particularly consumers. Federal deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) is required for all banks in the United States, and maintaining FDIC insurance requires observation of the various rules of the FDIC, as well as payment of deposit premiums. New branches, or acquisitions or mergers, are required to be pre-approved by the responsible agency, which in the case of the Company and the Bank is the Federal Reserve and the PDB. The Bank provides detailed financial information to its regulators, including a quarterly call report that is filed pursuant to detailed prescribed instructions to ensure that all U.S. banks report the same way. The U.S. banking laws and regulations are frequently updated and amended, especially in response to crises in the financial industry, such as the global financial crisis of 2008, which resulted in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), a statute affecting many facets of the financial industry. 
 While it is impractical to discuss all laws and regulations that regularly affect the business of the Company and its subsidiaries, set forth below is an overview of some of the major provisions and statutes that apply. 
 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 One of the most significant regulatory requirements for banking institutions is minimal capital, imposed as a ratio of capital to assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the FDIA), identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. It requires U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements based on these categories. Both federal and state banking regulation impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Unless a bank is well capitalized, it is subject to restrictions on its ability to utilize brokered deposits and on other aspects of its operations. Generally, a bank is prohibited from paying any dividend or making any capital distribution or paying any management fee to its holding company if the bank would thereafter be undercapitalized. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company believes that its bank subsidiary was well capitalized, based on the prompt corrective action guidelines described above. On January 1, 2015, U.S. federal banking agencies implemented the new Basel III capital standards, which establish the minimum capital levels to be considered well-capitalized and revise the prompt corrective action requirements under banking regulations. The revisions from the previous standards include a revised definition of capital, the introduction of a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio and changed risk weightings for certain assets. The implementation of the new rules will be phased in over a four year period ending January 1, 2019 with minimum capital requirements becoming increasingly more strict each year of the transition. The new minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements (which includes the impact of the capital conservation buffer applicable to each year) are as follows:

 TABLE OF CONTENTS


 | Minimum Capital | | Well Capitalized
 | Effective January 1,
 | 2017 | | 2018 
Common equity tier 1 capital ratio | | 5.75 | % | 6.38 | % | 6.5 | %
Tier 1 capital ratio | | 7.25 | % | 7.88 | % | 8.0 | %
Total capital ratio | | 9.25 | % | 9.88 | % | 10.0 | %

 Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, which increases over the transition period, from 0.625% of total risk weighted assets in 2016 to 2.50% in 2019. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital began on January 1, 2015 and were to be phased-in over a three-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015, 60% on January 1, 2016 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). Effective January 1, 2018, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a final rule that paused the full transition of these Basel III deduction and adjustment provisions at 80%. 
 DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS 
 The primary source of cash to pay dividends, if any, to the Companys shareholders and to meet the Companys obligations is dividends paid to the Company by the Bank and the Trust Company. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Company are subject to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Banking Code, the FDIA and the regulation of the PDB and of the Federal Reserve. Under the Banking Act and the FDIA, a bank may not pay any dividends if, after paying such dividends, it would be undercapitalized under applicable capital requirements. In addition to these explicit limitations, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
 It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available from the immediately preceding year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividend that undermines the bank holding companys ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. A bank holding company may not pay dividends when it is insolvent.

 SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is not a banking law, but contains important requirements for public companies in the area of financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with Section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, written certifications by the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer are required. These certifications attest, among other things, that the Companys quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. In response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company adopted a series of procedures to further strengthen its corporate governance practices. The Company also requires signed certifications from managers who are responsible for internal controls throughout the Company as to the integrity of the information they prepare. These procedures supplement the Companys Code of Conduct Policy and other procedures that were previously in place. The Company maintains a program designed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This program included the identification of key processes and accounts, documentation of the design of control effectiveness over the key processes and entity level controls, and testing of the effectiveness of key controls. 
PRIVACY PROVISIONS 
 Federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about customers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties. The privacy provisions affect how consumer

 information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. The Company believes it is in compliance with the various provisions. 
 USA PATRIOT ACT 
 A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has issued and, in some cases, proposed a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company. 
DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 
 The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. This law significantly changed the previous bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. 
 A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. 
 Bank and thrift holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, are permitted to include trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010, such as the Companys 8.45% Trust Preferred Securities, as Tier 1 capital; however, trust preferred securities issued by a bank or thrift holding company (other than those with assets of less than $500 million) after May 19, 2010, will no longer count as Tier 1 capital. Such trust preferred securities still will be entitled to be treated as Tier 2 capital. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), a new independent regulatory agency with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets such as the Company will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws. 
 ECONOMIC GROWTH, REGULATORY RELIEF, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), which was designed to ease certain restrictions imposed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, was enacted into law on May 24, 2018. Most of the changes made by the Act can be grouped into five general areas: mortgage lending; certain regulatory relief for community banks; enhanced consumer protections in specific areas, including subjecting credit reporting agencies to additional requirements; certain regulatory relief for large financial institutions, including increasing the threshold at which institutions are classified a systemically important financial institutions (from $50 billion to $250 billion) and therefore subject to stricter oversight, and revising the rules for larger institution stress testing; and certain changes to federal securities regulations designed to promote capital formation. Some of the key provisions of the Act as it relates to community banks and bank holding companies include, but are

 not limited to: (i) designating mortgages held in portfolio as qualified mortgages for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, subject to certain documentation and product limitations; (ii) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from Volcker Rule requirements relating to proprietary trading; (iii) simplifying capital calculations for banks with less than $10 billion in assets by requiring federal banking agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity to average consolidate assets not less than 8% or more than 10% and provide that banks that maintain tangible equity in excess of such ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with risk-based capital and leverage requirements; (iv) assisting smaller banks with obtaining stable funding by providing an exception for reciprocal deposits from FDIC restrictions on acceptance of brokered deposits; (v) raising the eligibility for use of short-form Call Reports from $1 billion to $5 billion in assets; and (vi) clarifying definitions pertaining to high volatility commercial real estate loans (HVCRE), which require higher capital allocations, so that only loans with increased risk are subject to higher risk weightings. Proposed regulations implementing the provisions of EGRR&CPA have been issued by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, but nothing has been finalized. The Company continues to analyze the changes implemented by the Act and further rulemaking from federal banking regulators, but, at this time, does not believe that such changes will materially impact the Companys business, operations, or financial results.
