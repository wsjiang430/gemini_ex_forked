Item 1. Business.
General
Everspin is a pioneer in the successful commercialization of Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) technology. Our portfolio of MRAM technologies, including Toggle MRAM and Spin-transfer Torque MRAM (STT-MRAM), is delivering superior performance, persistence and reliability in non-volatile memories that transform how mission-critical data is protected against power loss. With over 15 years of MRAM technology and manufacturing leadership, our memory solutions deliver significant value to our customers in key markets such as industrial, medical, automotive/transportation, aerospace, and data center. We are the leading supplier of discrete MRAM components and a successful licensor of our broad portfolio of related technology intellectual property.
We sell our products directly and through our established distribution channels to industry-leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs).
We manufacture our MRAM products using both captive and third-party manufacturing capabilities. We purchase industry-standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) wafers from semiconductor foundries and perform back end of line (BEOL) processing that includes our magnetic-bit technology at our 200mm fabrication facility in Chandler, Arizona. We also manufacture full-flow 300mm CMOS wafers with our STT-MRAM magnetic-bit technology integrated in BEOL as part of our strategic relationship with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. 

For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded revenue of $60.0 million and $55.1 million, gross margin of 56.6% and 60.0%, and net income of $6.1 million and $4.3 million, respectively. Our headquarters is located in Chandler, Arizona. Our principal design center is in Austin, Texas, and we have additional sales operations in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions.
Product Overview
We have a strong track record of innovation in MRAM technology, as demonstrated by our successive introduction of MRAM products that address an increasingly broad spectrum of applications. Our MRAM discrete solutions as well as other offerings are described as follows:
Toggle MRAM
Our Toggle MRAM products have been in production since 2008 and are currently shipping in 128kb to 32Mb densities. These high performance, non-volatile memories are designed primarily to address applications in the industrial, medical, automotive/transportation, and data center markets. We offer these products with industry standard interfaces, including Parallel, Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and Quad SPI (QSPI) interfaces, enabling our customers to easily replace legacy memory components like Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) and Ferroelectric Random Access Memory (FRAM) with Toggle MRAM. We have never had an end-of-life event for any of our Toggle MRAM products which enables our customers to design in a product with the assurance that it will be available for many years to come.

Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM
Spin Transfer Torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) technology can be tuned to deliver products in Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), SRAM and NOR Flash applications. Our STT-MRAM products targeting DRAM replacement started production in 2017 and are currently shipping in 256Mb and 1Gb densities. These high density, high performance persistent memories are delivering significant value to SSD, Persistent Memory Cards, Fabric Accelerator, and other applications in the data center market. We offer these products with DDR3 and DDR4 derivative interfaces, facilitating the replacement of battery-backed DRAM with STT-MRAM. 
STT-MRAM enabled scaling of our Toggle MRAM products to higher densities on advanced CMOS nodes. In 2022, we started production of high density (8Mb to 128Mb) STT-MRAM products on 28nm CMOS node with standardized SPI, QSPI, and Octal SPI (OSPI) interfaces. These products are enabling our customers to simplify their system architecture and easily replace legacy memory components like SRAM and FRAM. They are ideal for use in electronic systems where data persistence and integrity, low power, low latency, and security are paramount, such as industrial IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), network/enterprise infrastructure, process automation and control, aeronautics/avionics, medical, and gaming.
Due to the limitations of NOR scaling past 45nm and availability of STT-MRAM on 22nm technology, we believe there is potential for STT-MRAM to enter multiple non-volatile memory (NVM) markets where fast reads/writes, high cycle counts, and extended data retention are required. We introduced the first STT-MRAM product addressing this segment of the market in 2022 and are currently shipping in 16Mb to 128Mb densities. STT-MRAM is uniquely positioned to deliver higher density (> 256Mb) monolithic parts for NOR replacement. These products are ideal for replacing NOR in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) systems to store configuration memory and simultaneously enabling 100x faster Over The Air (OTA) updates. Today, no viable single chip solution exists except STT-MRAM.
Typically, on power up of a FPGA, the configuration memory that is stored off- or on- chip in a NOR chip is downloaded to the SRAM cells that execute the Look Up Tables (LUTs). This sequence of events creates a time lag between the power up and the execution of the LUTs. In addition, there is a security concern with the download of the configuration bit stream from the NOR to the SRAM. We have developed our STT-MRAM technology to act as the "configuration memory” in a FPGA eliminating the security concern and enabling instant-on characteristics. Furthermore, the STT-MRAM based configuration memory can be programmed multiple times with OTA updates or can be hard coded depending on the application. Since STT-MRAM can be scaled to advanced nodes and is already available on 22nm, monolithic embedded solutions are possible, we believe this solution is ideal for next generation FPGAs.
TMR Sensors
Our 3D Tunnel Magneto Resistance (TMR) sensors provide extremely high magnetic sensitivity in a single component that performs 3D magnetic field measurements in a monolithic solution. We offer these die-level devices to be integrated into consumer electronic applications that utilize a high sensitivity 3D compass function.
Licensing, Royalty, and Patent Overview
We leverage our broad IP portfolio to enable licensing, royalty revenue streams, and patent sales from non-core applications that can derive valuable differentiation through the use of Everspin MRAM and TMR sensor IP. For example, this includes the following:

● | We have licensed GLOBALFOUNDRIES to offer embedded MRAM in the solutions they manufacture for their customers providing high-performance non-volatile embedded memory.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have licensed base MRAM design technology (EAR99) for use in radiation tolerant aerospace applications to customers for their custom designs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have licensed TMR sensor IP in 3D magnetic field sensing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Foundry Services Overview
In our Chandler facility, we perform BEOL manufacturing services for customers who want to add MRAM and TMR sensor functionality to their memory or application base circuits. These services allow aerospace and satellite electronic system manufacturers to integrate our EAR99 technology that is able to withstand exposure to the levels of radiation encountered in avionics and space applications by virtue of such technology being magnetic rather than electrical charge based which would be susceptible to alpha particles.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products through a direct sales channel and a network of representatives and distributors. The majority of our customers, and their associated contract manufacturers, buy our products through our distributors. We maintain sales, support, supply chain and logistics operations and have distributors in Asia to service the production needs of contract manufacturers. We also maintain direct selling relationships with several strategic customers. Our direct sales representatives are located in North America, Germany, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
Our typical sales cycle consists of a sales and development process in which our field engineers and sales personnel work closely with our customers’ design engineers. This process can take from three to 18 months to complete, and a successful sales cycle culminates in a design win. Note that some customers of our STT-MRAM products may need to modify their controllers to integrate our technology, adding additional time to the cycle. Once we establish a relationship with a customer, we continue a sales process to maintain our position and to secure subsequent new design wins at the customer. Each customer lead, whether new or existing, is tracked through our CRM tool and followed in stages of prospect, design in, design win and production. This tracking results in a design win pipeline that provides a measure of the future business potential of the opportunities.
We have established relationships with several storage controller and FPGA companies, including Phison Electronics, Sage Micro, and Xilinx as well as IP core companies, including Cadence and Northwest Logic, to facilitate the integration of our MRAM solutions into our customers’ end products.
Our technical support personnel have expertise in hardware and software, and have access to our development team to ensure proper service and support for our OEM customers. Our field application and engineering team provides technical training and design support to our customers.
We consider our customer to be an end customer purchasing either directly from a distributor or a contract manufacturer, or a customer purchasing directly from us. An end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs the contract manufacturer to obtain our products and to incorporate our products with other components for sale by the contract manufacturer to the end customer. Although we actually sell the products to, and are paid by, the distributors and contract manufacturers, we refer to the end customer as our customer.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, more than 1,300 end customers purchased our products. Our four largest end customers together accounted for 24% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and one of these customers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during that period. Our four largest end customers together accounted for 47% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and one of these customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the period.

Arrangements with GLOBALFOUNDRIES
Joint Development Agreement
Since October 17, 2014, we have participated in a joint development agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc., a semiconductor foundry, for the joint development of STT-MRAM technology to produce a family of discrete and embedded MRAM technologies. The term of the agreement is until the completion, termination, or expiration of the last statement of work entered into pursuant to the joint development agreement. The agreement was extended on December 31, 2019 to include a new phase of support for 12nm MRAM development.
The joint development agreement also states that the specific terms and conditions for the production and supply of the developed MRAM technology would be pursuant to a separate manufacturing agreement entered into between the parties. See “Manufacturing Agreement” below.
Under the joint development agreement, each party granted licenses to its relevant intellectual property to the other party. For certain jointly developed works, the parties have agreed to follow an invention allocation procedure to determine ownership. In addition, GLOBALFOUNDRIES possesses the exclusive right to manufacture our discrete and embedded STT-MRAM devices developed pursuant to the agreement until the earlier of three years after the qualification of the MRAM device for a particular technology node or four years after the completion of the relevant statement of work under which the device was developed. For the same exclusivity period associated with the relevant device, GLOBALFOUNDRIES agreed not to license intellectual property developed in connection with the agreement to named competitors of ours.
If GLOBALFOUNDRIES manufactures, sells, or transfers wafers containing production qualified MRAM devices that utilized certain Everspin design information to its customers, GLOBALFOUNDRIES will pay royalties to us for each such wafer transferred or sold to a customer.
Except for breaches of confidentiality provisions and each party’s indemnification obligations to one another under the agreement, liability under the agreement is capped at a range depending on project costs and royalty amounts. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches a term of the agreement, and fails to remedy the breach after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. If a party terminates the manufacturing agreement for material breach in accordance with its terms, that party may also terminate the joint development agreement.
See “Risk Factors” for further discussion of our agreements with GLOBALFOUNDRIES.
Manufacturing Agreement
On October 23, 2014, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Singapore Pte. Ltd. that sets forth the specific terms and conditions for the production and supply of wafers manufactured using our STT-MRAM technology developed under the joint development agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Pursuant to that joint development agreement, GLOBALFOUNDRIES possesses certain exclusive rights to manufacture such wafers for our discrete and embedded STT-MRAM devices. Our manufacturing agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES includes a customary forecast and ordering mechanism for the supply of certain of our wafers, and we are obligated to order and pay for, and GLOBALFOUNDRIES is obligated to supply, wafers consistent with the binding portion of our forecast.

GLOBALFOUNDRIES also has the ability to discontinue its manufacture of any of our wafers upon due notice and completion of the notice period. The initial term of the manufacturing agreement is for three years, which automatically renews for successive one year periods thereafter unless either party provides sufficient advance notice of non-renewal.
Except for breaches of confidentiality provisions and each party’s indemnification obligations to one another under the agreement, liability under the agreement is capped at the lesser of a set amount or the total purchase price received by GLOBALFOUNDRIES from us in the 12 months immediately preceding the claim for the specific product that caused the damages. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches a term of the agreement, and fails to remedy the breach after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. GLOBALFOUNDRIES may terminate the agreement if we fail to pay any undisputed sum which has been outstanding for sixty or more days from the date of invoice.
Product Warranty
Because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. In accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions.
Competition
As an emerging specialty memory product supplier, we face intense competition from a wide variety of other memory technology manufacturers.
Our principal competitors to our Toggle MRAM products include companies that offer nonvolatile SRAM (NVSRAM), SRAM, and FRAM products, such as Infineon, Fujitsu, Integrated Silicon Solution (ISSI), Macronix, Microchip, Micron, Renesas, Samsung and Toshiba. Our STT-MRAM products replace discrete NOR, DRAM and SRAM where persistence is required and thus compete with DRAM and SRAM suppliers such as Hynix, Micron, Winbond, Samsung, and several other smaller companies. In the future we may also face competition from companies developing MRAM technologies, such as Avalanche, Samsung and other larger and smaller semiconductor companies. We may also face indirect competition from resistive random-access memory (RRAM), NOR and NAND Flash manufacturers in some market applications.

Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. As of December 31, 2022, we held 520 issued patents that expire at various times between February 2023 and October 2042 and had 146 patent applications pending. Included in our issued patents and pending applications are patents/applications in the United States, China, Europe, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.
We seek to file for patents that have broad application in the semiconductor industry and that would be helpful in the magnetoresistive memory and sensor markets. However, there can be no assurance that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved, that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents or applications of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property, or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets, or that we can effectively protect our intellectual property.
We seek to enforce our IP and to monetize our patent portfolio through licensing of third parties and patent sales in return for cash remuneration, patent cross licenses or both. See “Licensing, Royalty, and Patent Overview” for additional information.
We generally control access to and use of our confidential information through employing internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, and customers. We rely in part on U.S. and international copyright laws to protect our intellectual property. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship.
Environmental Regulation
We must comply with many different federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in our manufacturing processes. Our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations and we believe that our activities are conducted in material compliance with such regulations. Any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Any failure by us to adequately control the storage, use, discharge, and disposal of regulated substances could result in significant future liabilities.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 74 total employees in the United States, all of which were full-time employees, and 15 full-time equivalent and 3 part-time equivalent contractors and consultants in China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees and contractors to be good.
