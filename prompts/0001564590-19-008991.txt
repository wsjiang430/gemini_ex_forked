Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Fulgent is a growing technology company offering comprehensive genetic testing and providing physicians with clinically actionable diagnostic information they can use to improve the quality of patient care. We have developed a proprietary technology platform that allows us to offer a broad and flexible test menu and continually expand and improve our proprietary genetic reference library, while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times. Combining next generation sequencing, or NGS, with our technology platform, we perform full-gene sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis in single-gene tests; pre-established, multi-gene, disease-specific panels; and customized panels that can be tailored to meet specific customer needs. We believe our test menu offers more genes for testing than our competitors in today’s market, which enables us to provide expansive options for test customization and clinically actionable results. After launching our first commercial genetic tests in 2013, we have expanded our test menu to include approximately 18,000 single-gene tests and more than 900 panels that collectively test for approximately 7,600 genetic conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders and pediatric conditions. A cornerstone of our business is our ability to provide expansive options and flexibility for all clients’ unique genetic testing needs.
 Genetic testing offers the possibility of early identification of a disease or a genetic predisposition to a disease and enhanced disease treatment and prognosis. As a result, we believe widespread genetic testing could enable significant health improvements and healthcare cost reductions by providing patients and clinicians with more advanced knowledge and options for personal health management plans. Due to these and other potential benefits, genetic testing has experienced significant growth in recent years. If this growth trend continues, we believe genetic testing will become part of standard medical care. The knowledge of a person’s unique genetic makeup could then begin to play a more important role in the practice of medicine. We believe this growth has been tempered in prior years, however, because many tests are prohibitively expensive, are produced through inefficient processes and often do not result in clinically actionable data. Through our technology platform, we have developed an offering that we believe addresses these industry challenges and provides a sustainable competitive advantage, both in today’s genetic testing market and as we seek to implement new diagnostic tools in the future. 
 Our technology platform, which integrates sophisticated data comparison and suppression algorithms, adaptive learning software, advanced genetic diagnostics tools and integrated laboratory processes, allows us to offer a test menu with expansive genetic coverage. We believe the comprehensive data output and high detection rates of our tests, both made possible by this expansive genetic coverage, provide physicians with information they can readily incorporate into treatment decisions for their patients, which we refer to as clinical actionability. In addition, our technology platform facilitates our ability to perform customized genetic tests using our expansive library of genes, and we believe this flexibility increases the utility of the genetic data we produce. Further, our technology platform provides us with operating efficiencies that help lower our internal costs, which allows us to offer our tests at accessible price points. As a result, our efforts to build and continually enhance our technology platform allow us to deliver comprehensive, adaptable, clinically actionable and affordable genetic analysis while maintaining a low cost per billable test, enabling us to efficiently meet the needs of our growing base of customers. These features of our offering have resulted in rapid volume growth since our commercial launch, with 22,298 billable tests delivered in 2018, 16,578 billable tests delivered in 2017, and an aggregate of over 59,201 billable tests delivered to approximately 980 customers from inception through December 31, 2018.
Genetic Testing Industry
 Genetic testing identifies mutations in genes or chromosomal abnormalities. The results of genetic tests can be used to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of a suspected genetic condition, to predict a person’s likelihood of developing a genetic condition, and to improve the selection and implementation of drug treatment programs targeting specific diseases. 
 The availability and accessibility of genetic testing has grown significantly in recent years, due in large part to improvements in testing technologies, particularly next generation sequencing. NGS technology, a genetic testing technique that enables millions of DNA fragments to be sequenced in parallel, has dramatically lowered the cost and improved the quality of genetic testing. As technology advances continue to drive costs down and improve testing quality, the availability and accessibility of genetic tests is expected to continue to accelerate. This expansion of testing availability and accessibility, as well as a growing and aging population; increasing overall incidence of disease; innovations in genomic medicine that enable the selection and implementation of drug treatment programs based on genetic information, or pharmacogenomics; and other factors all contribute to expectations of continued growth in the global market for genetic testing.

While adoption of genetic testing has increased in recent years, we believe widespread utilization has been tempered because of certain challenges and barriers to adoption that exist in today’s market. These industry challenges include: the continued high prices of some genetic tests, in spite of declining prices in recent periods; largely inadequate reimbursement options, due to third-party payors’ restrictions on reimbursement to only a narrow subset of genetic tests and certain patients who meet specific criteria; the limited scope of some genetic analysis, which may test only a small portion of the genes in the human genome and thus may fail to diagnose or identify a predisposition to a condition that is linked to mutations in untested genes; inefficient testing processes, which often involve sequential retesting from multiple different laboratories in order to obtain comprehensive results; and the cumbersome and time-consuming nature of test results interpretation, which requires significant expertise and time to review proprietary and publicly available information about individual genetic disorders, genes and variants and understand the implications of genetic mutations that are identified in a genetic test. In addition, the increased competition in our industry in recent years, due in large part to the growth of genetic testing, as well as the cost-saving initiatives on the part of government entities and other third-party payors, have resulted in downward pressure on the price for genetic analysis and interpretation, which have posed challenges to genetic testing laboratories as they seek to maintain both competitive pricing and acceptable revenue levels and margins on test sales. We have approached these competitive and operational industry challenges by building and continually advancing a multi-faceted, scalable technology platform that we believe will facilitate our ability to address many of these challenges.
 Our Technology Platform 
 Our technology-driven approach to the challenges facing our industry has resulted in our development of an integrated technology platform featuring the following proprietary tools and processes: 
Proprietary Gene Probes
 Many genetic testing providers use gene probes in the sequencing process to extract and target specific genomic regions. A gene probe is a single strand of DNA or RNA that has a base sequence complementary to the base sequence of a targeted gene and that binds to this complementary base sequence when introduced during the sequencing process, thereby identifying the presence and location of the targeted gene. Many companies obtain these gene probes from third-party suppliers. We have developed technologies to design and formulate our own proprietary gene probes, which, when combined with our proprietary genetic reference library and publicly available genetic databases, support our ability to sequence DNA regions we believe laboratories using commercial probes cannot sequence and improve the detection rate of our test data. In turn, we believe this enables us to produce clinically actionable results physicians can use to improve care for their patients. In addition, our proprietary gene probes are specifically engineered to generate genetic data optimized for our software, which enables us to rapidly incorporate new genes into our test menu, develop new panels of disease-specific tests and customize tests for our customers. Moreover, once we develop a probe for a new gene, we can efficiently reproduce, validate and assure the quality of that probe under applicable guidelines and standards, which allows us to continuously and rapidly expand our library of genetic content while increasing the breadth of our test menu. Additionally, we believe our probes more effectively enrich the targeted genes to improve the quality of the sequenced data we produce.
Advanced Database Algorithms
 After DNA is sequenced using all appropriate equipment and tools, the fully sequenced genes are analyzed in a process known as curation, in which every DNA sequence is aligned with a known reference sequence and differences between the DNA sequence and the reference sequence are identified. These differences, which represent potential genomic alterations, are then compared to publicly available genetic databases and proprietary genetic libraries to identify pathogenic alterations associated with disease or disease risk. We have developed proprietary data comparison and data suppression algorithms to improve and simplify this curation process by highlighting identified pathogenic mutations. Our advanced data comparison algorithms measure DNA sequences from patient specimens against genetic data available from the broader scientific community and our own proprietary reference library of genetic information, which enables us to rapidly and effectively detect pathogenic mutations. Our advanced data suppression algorithms reduce irrelevant noise in the genetic data we analyze, which improves the efficiency and speed of our data analysis and reduces the reliance upon manual review and comparison in the curation process.
Adaptive Learning Software
 We have developed software that automatically incorporates the data from each completed test into our expansive genetic reference library, enabling it to continuously evolve with each set of genes we analyze. This adaptive learning software supports the continuous improvement of our proprietary gene probes and leverages the capabilities of these gene probes to improve the speed and effectiveness of curation and reporting. Our adaptive learning software also communicates with our integrated laboratory systems, which leads to increasing automation processes and other operating efficiencies.

Proprietary Laboratory Information Management Systems
 We have developed proprietary laboratory information management systems that are highly integrated with our laboratory processes and adaptive learning software. These systems provide the backbone by which we efficiently manage workflow, monitor quality and ensure the fidelity of information generation and analytics for reporting to our customers. The result is a highly connected platform that allows us to process tests and information in an efficient manner. Our talented team of software engineers continuously iterates with our laboratory and customer-facing personnel to improve the efficiencies of these systems.
Our Solution 
 The benefits provided by our technology platform include: 
 Low Internal Cost per Billable Test
 We have developed various proprietary technologies that improve our laboratory efficiency and reduce the costs we incur to perform our tests. This technology platform enables us to perform each test and deliver its results at a lower internal cost than many of our competitors, averaging approximately $480 per billable test delivered in 2018. This low cost per billable test allows us to maintain affordable pricing for our customers, averaging approximately $958 per billable test delivered in 2018, which we believe encourages repeat ordering from existing customers and attracts new customers. We believe our low cost per billable test could also facilitate the process for establishing coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at a level adequate for us to achieve profitability with this payor group.
Broad and Flexible Test Menu
 We currently offer single-gene tests on approximately 18,000 genes, which we believe is thousands more than most of our competitors’ portfolios. Based on the results of a retrospective study of individuals with a personal or family history of cancer, described below, we believe the breadth of genes in our portfolio allows us to provide more comprehensive genetic information and improves our variant detection rate, which can increase the clinical actionability of the data we produce. The breadth of genes in our portfolio also allows us to provide a flexible and customizable test menu for our customers, which can reduce the need for sequential retesting. We offer single-gene tests on all of the genes in our portfolio, as well as deletion/duplication analysis and site-specific tests. If customers desire a broader test, we offer more than 900 pre-established, multi-gene panels that focus on specified genetic conditions. These panels can be adjusted up or down to include more or fewer genes, or customers can design their own panels to their exact specifications. We also offer clinical and full gene exome testing options. We offer our tests at different price points and turnaround times depending on the size and complexity of the test, which increases optionality for our customers. We believe the flexibility of our offering improves the efficiency and utility of the data output by our tests and decreases overall customer costs. We also offer our customers access to our highly qualified genetic counselors and laboratory experts to assist in interpreting the data we provide, which further increases the utility of our test results for ordering physicians.
 The benefit of including multiple genes on a single panel was discussed in a study published in 2016 by the University of Southern California, or USC, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center in Cancer Genetics. The study retrospectively evaluated 475 individuals with a personal or family history of cancer who had undergone a clinically indicated multi-gene panel test of six to 110 genes from one of the following six commercial laboratories: Myriad Genetics (n=354), Ambry Genetics (n=100), Fulgent (n=17), University of Washington Genetics Laboratory (n=2), City of Hope Molecular Diagnostics (n=1) and Baylor Genetics Laboratory (n=1). The study concluded that multi-gene panel testing increases the yield of mutations detected and adds to the capability of providing individualized cancer risk assessment. More specifically, the study reported that deleterious mutations were identified in 15.6% of patients tested on a variety of multi-gene panels, which included 8.6% of patients who would not have a mutation detected if a targeted gene-by-gene-approach had been used. The study also presented evidence that, as the number of genes on a panel increased, a higher proportion of panels identified a mutation. The Fulgent panels evaluated in the study contained over 100 genes compared to less than 30 genes in the next largest panel. Additionally, approximately 35% of our panels identified a genetic mutation, and in comparison, the test with the next highest percentage of detected mutations identified mutations in approximately 17% of its tests.

Expansive and Growing Genetic Library
 Using our proprietary gene probes and testing processes, we are able to capture large amounts of genetic information from each test we perform—oftentimes more than is ordered for the test—without an incremental increase in our costs. Through this data collection process, we have developed a proprietary reference library of expansive genetic information. This reference library is automatically curated by our adaptive learning software and supplemented with manual curation by our team of highly trained professionals, which adds to and improves upon the information available in public genetic databases. As a result, our integrated technology systems allow us to leverage publicly available information from the broader scientific community with our internally developed reference library to develop what we believe is a more reliable catalog of genetic information and to accelerate, standardize and improve our curation and reporting process.
Our Genetic Tests 
 

Our offering consists of a wide variety of tests and test types, and our customers have a high degree of choice when selecting a test from our menu. A customer may select a single-gene test of any of the genes in our portfolio or a customer may select one of our pre-established panel tests, which are designed to test particular genes and mutations within these genes that relate to a wide range of specified conditions and diseases. For example, our Focus and Comprehensive oncology panels test 30 genes and 127 genes, respectively, that relate to various cancers and our Beacon carrier screening panels test up to 336 genes covering over 320 inherited conditions. We can perform full-gene sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis in all of these tests. In addition, we continually seek to expand our test menu with new genes and panel tests, including our plans to expand our reproductive testing options, including preimplantation genetic screening, or PGS, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD. We also plan to increase the genes available on our expanded Beacon carrier screening panel, which, along with preimplantation genetic testing options and newborn genetic analysis options, will round out our family planning testing options. New test offerings in 2018 included solid tumor molecular profiling for somatic cancer testing, rapid whole genome testing developed for children in neonatal intensive care units, or NICU, or pediatric intensive care units, or PICU, our newborn genetic analysis panel, and a single front-line test designed to comprehensively detect ataxia-related variants and repeat expansions via sequencing.
 We also offer certain research service tests, which we refer to as “sequencing as a service” and which are primarily ordered by our research institution and other similar institutional customers. In addition, we offer whole exome and clinical exome panel tests, which test all genes included in our portfolio and up to 4,681 genes located in the exome, respectively, and produce results that we combine with the individual’s unique clinical presentation and family history to enhance the clinical relevance of the results. Our whole exome and clinical exome tests also include the option for Trio testing, which involves sequencing the genes of a patient’s parents and is thought to enhance the utility of the test results. In addition, we offer whole genome testing, which determines and tests the complete DNA sequence of a genome at a single time. We also provide known mutation testing, which can be used to target familial specific or other desired mutations, as well as repeat expansion testing, which tests for a particular type of mutation known as “copy choice” DNA replication. 
 Importantly, all of our pre-established panels are customizable, offering customers the ability to add or remove genes at their election. To further increase test option flexibility, as well as to reduce the complexity of ordering tests, we consistently strive to innovate our pricing structure and features for our available tests. To this end, we implemented several new features in late 2018: As a standard offer, pricing for pre-established panels, exome panel tests, and reflex test options now consists of one flat fee for singleton, duo, or trio testing. In addition, if a variant is reported in a proband for whom duo or trio testing was not originally ordered, the ordering physician is given the option of adding complementary familial known mutation testing, or FKMT, for any variant reported by Fulgent in the proband’s final report, for up to two first-degree relatives. We believe these options represent competitive pricing features that will streamline the test ordering process, give customers more flexibility with added value, and reduce barriers to trio and familial testing, which can both increase the clinical utility of genetic testing for a single proband.

Our Customers 
 Since inception, we have sold our tests to approximately 980 total customers. We consider each single billing and paying unit to be an individual customer, even though a unit may represent multiple physicians and healthcare providers ordering tests. Aggregating customers that are under common control or are affiliates, one of our customers contributed 13% of our total revenue in 2018, and three of our customers each contributed 14%, 12% and 10% of our total revenue in 2017.
 We have primarily sold our tests to hospitals and medical institutions. We have approached the genetic testing market with a focus on these customers in part because they are frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests. We believe this customer base provides a meaningful opportunity for further growth by acquiring additional hospital and medical institution customers and by deepening our relationships with existing customers to drive increased ordering. Additionally, collection of billings from these institutional customers is generally more attainable than from other types of customers in today’s reimbursement environment, as approximately 78% of our test billings that were generated and due in 2018 were paid during that period. In addition, we believe hospitals and medical institutions are early adopters of NGS technology and could influence broader clinical acceptance of genetic testing.
We are also seeking to expand our customer base to include new customer groups. To this end, we have contracted directly with a national health insurance company to become an in-network provider and enrolled as a supplier with the Medicare program and some state Medicaid programs, in an effort to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our tests to make them accessible to more individual physicians. In addition, we are building relationships with research institutions and other similar institutional customers, a national clinical laboratory, regional medical networks and various other organizations to facilitate access to physicians, practitioners and other new customer groups, including certain U.S. military and other government agencies. Generally, when we establish these new customer relationships, we agree with the applicable payor, laboratory or other customer to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates, but, subject to limited exceptions, these relationships do not obligate any party to order our tests.
 Much of our business to date has been from non-U.S. customers, with approximately $8.8 million and $9.7 million of our revenue coming from non-U.S. sources in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These customers are located in a variety of geographic markets, including Canada, where we have historically focused much of our international efforts, the PRC, where we started selling tests directly to customers in the third quarter of 2016, and other regions, such as Australia, Europe and the Middle East. In addition, we have worked with one of our large stockholders to establish a joint venture to offer genetic testing to customers in the PRC, which was formed in April 2017 and which we refer to as FF Gene Biotech. We believe FF Gene Biotech could expand our long-term opportunities to address the genetic testing market in Asia.
 Our customers can generally be divided into three categories based on the party from which we receive payment for our tests: hospitals, medical and other institutions; patients and third-party payors. Hospitals, medical and other institutions are responsible for paying for the vast majority of the tests we have delivered since our inception. We bill these organizations for our tests and they are responsible for paying us directly and either billing their patients separately or obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors in connection with a patient’s diagnosis related group, or DRG. A small percentage of our customers are patients, who elect to pay for tests themselves with out-of-pocket payments after their physicians have ordered our tests. Third-party payors, which consist of private health insurers, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and certain state Medicaid agencies, have been responsible for paying for a small number of the tests we have delivered to date; however, as we seek to expand our customer base to include more individual practitioners, we expect this category of payors would be responsible for many of the tests we deliver to these customers. 
 Third-party payors require us to identify the test for which we are seeking reimbursement using a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code set maintained by the American Medical Association, or AMA. Where we offer a multi-gene panel and there is no CPT code for the full panel but the panel includes a gene for which the AMA has an established CPT code, we identify the test provided under that CPT code when billing a third-party payor for that test. In cases where there is not a specific CPT code, our test may be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Because this miscellaneous code does not describe a specific service, the insurance claim must be examined to determine what service was provided, whether the service was appropriate and medically necessary, and whether payment should be rendered, which may require a letter of medical necessity from the ordering physician. Given the changing CPT coding environment and our development of relationships with third-party payors, we expect that our practices regarding billing these payors will evolve in the future.

Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing force currently consists of two lean internal teams of sales and marketing experts, respectively, with deep experience in our industry, as well as a network of independent sales representatives who are knowledgeable about our tests. Historically, we have significantly relied on organic growth and word-of-mouth among our customers to generate interest in our tests, which we believe demonstrates the value of our offering. In recent periods, we have invested significant time and capital to strengthen our sales and marketing efforts, including increasing the size and restructuring the organization of our internal team, re-focusing our initiatives and strategies, and increasing the overall scope of our marketing activities.
Our sales and marketing strategy is designed to expand our brand awareness, grow our customer base and further penetrate our relationships with existing customers. We aim to achieve these objectives by providing education about the benefits and full scale of our offering, both to the medical community in general and to our targeted customer and geographic markets. We plan to expand our presence and test volume in international markets through our own direct sales team, which includes one sales person dedicated to international markets, a number of independent contractor sales representatives, and, if opportunities arise, by engaging distributors or establishing other types of arrangements, such as joint ventures or other relationships, to manage or assist with sales, logistics, education and customer support in certain territories. 
 Our marketing activities also include targeted initiatives, including working with medical professional societies to promote awareness of the benefits of our tests and genetic testing in general, presenting at medical, scientific or industry exhibitions and conferences and pursuing or supporting scientific studies of our tests and publication of results in medical or scientific journals, such as the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center study published in 2016 and discussed above and an evaluation of the clinical utility of proactive genetic screening for healthy individuals, which was presented at the 2018 American Society of Human Genetics conference. In addition, we conduct email advertising campaigns and social media awareness campaigns to existing and potential future customers when we want to send a specific message about our company and our brand, including, for instance, when we launch new tests or new test options and when we add new genes to our test menu. 
 Our sales and marketing strategy is also focused on offering differentiated and highly available customer service resources, which we believe is an important factor in maintaining and deepening our customer relationships. Genetic tests are highly complex by nature and we recognize that our customers may want to discuss with us available testing options, specimen collection requirements, expected turnaround times, the cost of our tests and the clinical reports we produce. As a result, we offer comprehensive customer service designed to enable efficient ordering and increase the accessibility of our clinical reports, including customer access to our licensed and qualified laboratory directors who review and approve each report we produce. 
 Our sales and marketing teams also explore strategic collaboration opportunities with various research and medical institutions. New partnerships formed in 2018 include a collaboration with the Columbia University Irving Medical Center to make expanded carrier screening available to Columbia patients, and a collaboration with StemCyte, a global regenerative therapeutics company, to offer both expanded carrier screening and newborn genetic analysis to families in the reproductive planning stage.
 Our Suppliers 
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain laboratory substances used in the chemical reactions incorporated into our processes, which we refer to as reagents, as well as for the sequencers and various other equipment and materials we use in our laboratory operations. In particular, we rely on Illumina, Inc. as the sole supplier of the next generation sequencers and associated reagents we use to perform our genetic tests and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers. Our laboratory operations would be interrupted if we encounter delays or difficulties securing these reagents, sequencers, other equipment or materials or maintenance and repair services, which could occur for a variety of reasons, including if we need a replacement or temporary substitute for any of our limited or sole suppliers and are not able to locate and make arrangements with an acceptable replacement or temporary substitute. 
Competition 
 Our competitors include dozens of companies focused on molecular genetic testing services, including specialty and reference laboratories that offer traditional single-gene and multi-gene tests. Principal competitors include companies such as Ambry Genetics, Inc.; Roche; GeneDx, a subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc.; Invitae Corporation; Myriad Genetics, Inc.; and Pathway Genomics Corporation, as well as other commercial and academic laboratories. In addition, other established and emerging healthcare, information technology and service companies may develop and sell competitive tests, which may include informatics, analysis, integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness.

Additionally, participants in closely related markets, such as prenatal testing and clinical trial or companion diagnostic testing, could converge on offerings that are competitive with the type of tests we perform. Instances where potential competitors are aligned with key suppliers or are themselves suppliers could provide these potential competitors with significant advantages. Further, hospitals, research institutions and eventually individual physicians and other practitioners may also seek to perform at their own facilities the type of genetic testing we would otherwise perform for them. In this regard, continued development of, and associated decreases in the cost of, equipment, reagents and other materials and databases and genetic data interpretation services may enable broader direct participation in genetic testing and analysis and drive down the use of third-party testing companies such as ours. Additionally, cost decreases and increased direct participation, as well as cost-saving initiatives on the part of government entities and other third-party payors, could intensify the downward pressure on the price for genetic analysis and interpretation generally. Moreover, the biotechnology and genetic testing fields continue to undergo significant consolidation, permitting larger clinical laboratory service providers to increase cost efficiencies and service levels, resulting in more intense competition.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are: 
  
• | breadth and depth of genetic content;
--+--------------------------------------


• | flexibility of test customization;
--+-----------------------------------


• | price of tests;
--+----------------


• | quality of results, including their reliability, accuracy and clinical actionability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | accessibility of results;
--+--------------------------


• | coverage and reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | turnaround time;
--+-----------------


• | customer service;
--+------------------


• | convenience of testing; and
--+----------------------------


• | brand recognition.
--+-------------------

 We believe we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, many of our existing and potential future competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more expansive brand recognition and deeper market penetration, substantially greater financial, technological and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities and considerably more experience dealing with third-party payors. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements or preferences, develop faster and better advancements for their technologies and tests, create and implement more successful strategies for the promotion and sale of their tests, obtain more favorable results from third-party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for their offerings, adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their tests, secure supplies from vendors on more favorable terms or devote substantially more resources to infrastructure and systems development. In addition, competitors may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies as use of NGS for clinical diagnosis and preventative care increases. Further, companies or governments that effectively control access to genetic testing through umbrella contracts or regional preferences could promote our competitors or prevent us from performing certain tests in certain territories. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. 
 Research and Development 
 We have assembled a highly-qualified team with expertise in a number of fields important to our business, such as bioinformatics, genetics, software engineering, laboratory management and sales and marketing. We rely on this team to conduct all of our research and development activities, including efforts to develop and curate our expansive library of genetic information and further expand our technology platform.
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of registered and unregistered intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, trademarks and customary contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. 
 7

Trade Secrets 
 We rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain and develop the competitive position afforded by many of our laboratory, analytic and business practices. For example, significant elements of our genetic tests and our testing procedures, including aspects of specimen preparation, our bioinformatics algorithms and related processes and our adaptive learning software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. We try to protect trade secrets and know-how by taking reasonable steps to keep them confidential, including entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees and certain third parties, and entering into invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. 
Trademarks 
 We own registered and unregistered trademark and service mark rights under applicable U.S. and foreign law to distinguish and/or protect our brand, including our company name and logo. 
 Regulation
CLIA 
 As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. In 1988, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, which establishes quality standards for all laboratory testing designed to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Our laboratory is CLIA-certified and accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, a CLIA-approved accrediting organization. 
 Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease or the impairment or assessment of health. CLIA requires that we hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations we perform and that we comply with various standards with respect to personnel qualifications, facility administration, proficiency testing, quality control and assurance and inspections. Laboratories must register and list their tests with CMS, the agency that oversees CLIA, and CLIA compliance and certification is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill government payors and many private payors for our tests. CLIA is user-fee funded, such that all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs. 
 We are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with CLIA’s program standards, and we may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Our CLIA certification was last renewed October 23, 2017 and is valid for two years. If our clinical reference laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA requirements at any of these inspections, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, a directed plan of correction, on-site monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive suits, criminal penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and significant adverse publicity. 
 In addition to CLIA requirements, we elect to participate in the accreditation program of CAP. CMS has deemed CAP standards to be equally or more stringent than CLIA regulations and has approved CAP as a recognized accrediting organization. Inspection by CAP is performed in lieu of inspection by CMS for CAP-accredited laboratories. Because we are accredited by the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA. 
State and Foreign Laboratory Licensure 
 Under CLIA, states may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures or facility requirements or prescribe record maintenance requirements. 
 Our genetic testing laboratory is located in Temple City, California. As a result, we are required to maintain a license to conduct testing in the State of California. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operations of our laboratory, including with respect to the training and skills required of personnel, quality control and proficiency testing requirements. If our clinical reference laboratory is out of compliance with California standards, the State of California Department of Public Health, or CA DPH, may suspend, restrict or revoke our license to operate our clinical reference laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially affect our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with CA DPH. 
 8

Additionally, several states require the licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states and/or receive specimens from laboratories in those states. Our laboratory holds the required out-of-state laboratory licenses to perform testing on specimens from Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania. In addition to having a laboratory license in New York, our laboratory is required to obtain approval on a test-specific basis by the New York State Department of Health before specific testing is performed on specimens from New York. Because our licensure application is currently pending in New York, we are currently prohibited from performing tests on specimens from New York until our license is approved.
Other states may adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which could require us to modify, delay or discontinue our operations in such jurisdictions. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow instructions from the state regulators as to how to comply with such requirements. 
 We are also subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, which we expect will increase as we seek to expand international utilization of our tests or if jurisdictions in which we pursue operations adopt new or modified licensure requirements. Foreign licensure requirements could require review and modification of our tests in order to offer them in certain jurisdictions or could impose other limitations, such as restrictions on the transport of human blood or other tissue necessary for us to perform our tests that may limit our ability to make our tests available outside of the United States on a broad scale. 
 FDA 
 Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic products, or IVDs, used for clinical purposes. The tests that we offer may be considered IVDs and as such, medical devices. The laws and regulations governing the marketing of IVDs are evolving, extremely complex, and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices. 
 The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device, are categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. When a 510(k) premarket notification submission is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to: (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which PMA approval is not required, (ii) a legally marketed device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or (iii) another legally marketed, similar device that has been cleared through the 510(k) clearance process. 
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses; and the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications, and criminal prosecution. 
 Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including IVDs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDC Act and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which are a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. We believe our tests fall within the definition of an LDT. As a result, we believe our diagnostic tests are not currently subject to the FDA’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable FDC Act provisions. 
 9

Even though we commercialize our tests as LDTs, our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA. Pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, the FDA notified Congress on July 31, 2014 that the FDA intended to issue in 60 days the draft Framework Guidance and the Notification Guidance. On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued the draft Framework Guidance and Notification Guidance for comment. The Framework Guidance stated that the FDA intends to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices. The draft guidances resulted in a large number of public comments from interested parties.  The FDA subsequently announced in November 2016 that it would not issue a final guidance to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate LDT oversight approach and to give congressional committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution. In January 2017, the FDA published a Discussion Paper on Laboratory Developed Tests, which provided a synthesis of the feedback the agency had received and which outlined, as part of the synthesis, a new possible approach to LDT oversight. The Discussion Paper noted that the synthesis does not represent the formal position of the FDA, nor is it enforceable. In December 2018, members of Congress released a discussion draft of a possible bill to regulate in vitro clinical tests including LDTs.
 If and when the FDA finalizes its position on regulation of LDTs through formal guidance, or new legislation is passed, or if the FDA disagrees with our assessment that our tests fall within the definition of an LDT, we could for the first time be subject to enforcement of regulatory requirements such as registration and listing requirements, medical device reporting requirements and quality control requirements (although the possible approach outlined in the Discussion Paper – as well as the recent Congressional discussion draft – would exempt certain previously marketed LDTs from many requirements, in other words, it would “grandfather” many existing LDTs). Any new FDA enforcement policies affecting LDTs may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our tests and to develop and introduce new tests in the future. Additionally, if and when the FDA begins to actively enforce its premarket submission regulations with respect to LDTs generally or our tests in particular, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance for our tests under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act or approval of a PMA. The process for submitting a 510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA generally takes from one to three years or even longer and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive clinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests, the FDA could require that we stop selling our products pending clearance or approval and conduct clinical testing prior to making submissions to FDA to obtain premarket clearance or approval. The FDA could also require that we label our tests as investigational or limit the labeling claims we are permitted to make. 
 While there is also the risk that the FDA does not consider our tests to be LDTs, the draft Framework Guidance stated that, in the interest of ensuring continuity in the testing market and avoiding disruption of access to tests marketed as LDTs that do not meet the FDA’s definition of LDTs, the FDA intends to apply the same risk-based framework described in the Framework Guidance to any IVD that is offered as an LDT by a CLIA-certified laboratory. We would expect the FDA to take the same or similar approach in any new program for the regulation of LDTs. If Congress passes legislation regulating LDTs, then the terms of such legislation would control, subject to FDA’s administration of any such new law.
 Additionally, the FDA has recently solicited public input and published two draft guidance documents relating to FDA oversight of NGS-based tests. The two draft guidance documents on NGS-based tests describe the FDA’s current thinking and proposed approach regarding the possible use of FDA-recognized standards to support analytical validity, and public human genetic variant databases to support clinical validity, of these tests. While it appears that the FDA is striving to provide a flexible pathway to device clearance or approval for manufacturers seeking to market NGS-based tests, it is unknown how the FDA may regulate such tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support such clearance or approval. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests and the FDA requires more extensive testing such as clinical trials, for example, we could experience significantly increased development costs and delay. 
 The FDA enforces its medical device requirements by various means, including inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an Untitled Letter or Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, such as: fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; and criminal prosecution.
Legislative proposals addressing the FDA’s oversight of LDTs have been introduced by Congress in the past and we expect that new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future. The likelihood that Congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the FDA’s plans to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to certain LDTs is difficult to predict at this time. If the FDA ultimately lifts its policy of enforcement discretion over LDTs and begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to LDTs, our tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA, the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the FDA or instruction by Congress. Failure to comply with any applicable FDA requirements could trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA, including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations and denial of or challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity.

Reimbursement 
 CPT Codes 
 Third-party payors, including private insurers and CMS, require genetic testing companies to identify each test for which reimbursement is sought using a CPT code set maintained by the AMA. These CPT codes in their current form are not readily applied to many of the genetic tests we conduct. For example, for many of our multi-gene panels, there may not be an appropriate CPT code for any genes in a panel, in which case our test would be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Because these miscellaneous codes do not describe a specific service, the insurance claim would need to be examined to determine the service that was provided, whether the service was appropriate and medically necessary and whether payment should be rendered. This process can require a letter of medical necessity from the ordering physician and it can result in a delay in processing the claim, a lower reimbursement amount or denial of the claim. 
 In September 2014, the AMA published new CPT codes for genomic sequencing procedures that are effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2015. These include genomic sequencing procedure codes for certain multi-gene panel tests. In a final determination under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, published in November 2014, CMS set the 2015 payment rate for these codes using the gap-fill process. Under the gap-fill process, local Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, establish rates for the codes that each MAC believes meet the criteria for Medicare coverage and considering laboratory charges and discounts to charges, resources, amounts paid by other payors for the tests and amounts paid by the MAC for similar tests. In 2015, gap-filled payment rates were established for some, but not all, of the published codes for genomic sequencing procedures. For the codes for which local gap-filled rates were established in 2015, a national limitation amount for Medicare was established for 2016. For the codes for which local gap-filled rates were not established in 2015, associated procedures are priced by the local MACs in 2016 if an individual MAC determines that such codes should be covered. Where available, the national limitation amount serves as a cap on the Medicare and Medicaid payment rates for a test procedure, which may not be adequate for all of the procedures covered by the applicable codes, including our tests to the extent we are required to report them under these codes. 
 PAMA 
 In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule are required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for “advanced diagnostic laboratory tests”), private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. We do not believe that our tests meet the current definition of advanced diagnostic laboratory tests, and therefore we believe we will be required to report private payor rates for our tests every three years. As required under PAMA, CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates for the tests. On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements under PAMA. 
 As set forth under PAMA, for tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018, Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests will be paid based upon these reported private payor rates. For clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are assigned a new or substantially revised CPT code, initial payment rates will be assigned by the gap-fill methodology, as under prior law. Initial payment rates for new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests will be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test. 
 The payment rates calculated under PAMA became effective starting January 1, 2018. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2018 through 2020 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2021 through 2023. In late 2017, CMS published the final payment rates and supporting documentation for the new private payor rate-based payment system.
 PAMA codifies Medicare coverage rules for laboratory tests by requiring any local coverage determination to be made following the local coverage determination process. PAMA also authorizes CMS to consolidate coverage policies for clinical laboratory tests among one to four laboratory-specific MACs. These same contractors may also be designated to process claims if CMS determines that such a model is appropriate. It is unclear whether CMS will proceed with contractor consolidation under this authorization. 
 PAMA also authorizes the adoption of new, temporary billing codes and/or unique test identifiers for FDA-cleared or approved tests as well as advanced diagnostic laboratory tests. The AMA’s CPT Editorial Panel has approved a proposal to create a new section of billing codes to facilitate implementation of this section of PAMA. At this time, it is unclear whether or when the new section of billing codes will be implemented, nor is it clear if or how these codes would apply to our tests.

Privacy and Security Laws 
 HIPAA and HITECH 
 Under the administrative simplification provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by most healthcare providers and other covered entities and their respective business associates, including subcontractors of business associates. The following four principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA and HITECH: privacy regulations, security regulations, the breach notification rule and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions. 
 The privacy regulations of HIPAA and HITECH cover the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and business associates, which include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI on behalf of a business associate. A subcontractor means any person to whom a business associate delegates a function, activity or service, other than in the capacity of the business associate’s workforce. As a general rule, a covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose PHI except as permitted under the privacy regulations of HIPAA and HITECH. The privacy regulations also set forth certain rights of an individual with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity or business associate, including the right to access or amend certain records containing his or her PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of his or her PHI. 
 Covered entities and business associates must also comply with the security regulations of HIPAA and HITECH, which establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. In addition, HITECH established, among other things, certain breach notification requirements with which covered entities and business associates must comply. In particular, a covered entity must notify any individual whose unsecured PHI is breached according to the specifications set forth in the breach notification rule. A covered entity must also notify the Secretary of HHS and, under certain circumstances, the media. 
 There are significant civil and criminal fines and other penalties that may be imposed for violating HIPAA. A covered entity or business associate is also liable for civil monetary penalties for a violation that is based on an act or omission of any of its agents, including a downstream business associate, as determined according to the federal common law of agency. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly depending on the failure and include civil monetary penalties of up to $1.5 million per violation of the same requirement per calendar year. A single breach incident can result in violations of multiple requirements, resulting in potential penalties in excess of $1.5 million. Additionally, a person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one year of imprisonment. These criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and HITECH, payments to us may be delayed or denied. 
 The HIPAA privacy, security, and breach notification regulations establish a uniform federal “floor,” but do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than PHI as defined under HIPAA. At least 30 states have enacted laws protecting the privacy and security of health information of residents of their states.The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and liability. Further, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux.
 State laws in the United States continue to evolve.  For example, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which will come into effect beginning in January 2020.  The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. There is uncertainty surrounding the application of the CCPA to parts of our business, and amendments to the law before its effective data may have impact on operations. In addition to the CCPA, other states are introducing similar legislation which will impact compliance obligations and increase complexity and cost of compliance.
 12

Numerous other federal, state and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, all 50 states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data privacy and data protection. The Federal Trade Commission and states’ Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information. 
 Foreign Laws 
 We are also subject to foreign privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we sell our tests. The interpretation, application and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. For example, the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and Cybersecurity Directive have been enacted in the European Union and became effective in May 2018. These texts introduced many changes to privacy and security in the European Union, including stricter rules on consent and security duties for critical industries, including for the health sector. The interpretation of some rules is still unclear, and some requirements may be completed by national legislation. This makes it difficult to assess the impact of these new data protection laws on our business at this time. More generally, foreign laws and interpretations governing data privacy and security are constantly evolving and it is possible that laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current practices, in which case we could be subject to government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices. These fines can be very high. For instance, the GDPR introduces fines of up to approximately $22 million or 4% of a group’s worldwide annual turnover for certain infringements. In addition, privacy regulations differ widely from country to country. 
 In many activities, including the conduct of clinical trials, we are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. These laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data, including the collection, access, use, analysis, modification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction and disposal of personal data. We must comply with laws and regulations associated with the international transfer of personal data based on the location in which the personal data originates and the location in which it is processed.
 If we or our vendors fail to comply with applicable data privacy laws, or if the legal mechanisms we or our vendors rely upon to allow for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States (or other countries not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection) are not considered adequate, we could be subject to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, and our business could be adversely impacted if our ability to transfer personal data outside of the European Union is restricted, which could adversely impact our operating results. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to European Union personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR. However, our ongoing efforts related to compliance with the GDPR may not be successful and could increase our cost of doing business. In addition, data protection authorities of the different European Union member states may interpret the GDPR, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union.  In addition to the GDPR, other countries have enacted data protection legislation which increase the complexity of doing international business and transferring sensitive personal information from those countries to the United States.
 The privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored, maintained, received or transmitted, including electronically, subject to significant regulation in the United States and abroad. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, legal standards for privacy continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 In the United States, we must comply with various fraud and abuse laws and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws. 
 13

Anti-Kickback and Fraud Statutes 
 In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in order to induce or in return for the referral of an individual for the furnishing of or arranging for the furnishing of, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, although it does contain several exceptions. HHS has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors,” which set forth certain provisions that, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with the statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Furthermore, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are severe and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can serve as a basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act (described below). Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. In addition, in October 2018 the SUPPORT Act was enacted to address the opioid crisis. The SUPPORT Act includes the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act (EKRA), which may have the effect of applying antikickback principles to clinical laboratories receiving patient referrals in the private pay or commercial insurance setting, even if the clinical laboratory does not offer services relating to addiction treatment or recovery.
 There are also U.S. federal laws related to healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. A violation of this statute is also a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs. 
 False Claims Act 
 Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal government payor program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government by submitting a false claim to the federal government and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which we collectively refer to as the Affordable Care Act, establishes a requirement for providers and suppliers to report and return any overpayments received from government payors under the Medicare and Medicaid programs within 60 days of identification. Failure to identify and return such overpayments exposes the provider or supplier to False Claims Act liability. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim. 
 In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a government payor program. 
 Civil Monetary Penalties Law 
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or for a claim that is false or fraudulent. This law also prohibits the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. 
 14

Physician Referral Prohibitions 
 The U.S. federal law directed at “self-referrals,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare program, to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a direct or indirect financial relationship, unless an exception applies. The prohibition also extends to payment for any services referred in violation of the Stark Law. A physician or entity that engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare program in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per service, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that a physician’s financial relationship with a laboratory must meet an exception under the Stark Law or the referrals are prohibited. Thus, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute’s safe harbors, if a laboratory’s financial relationship with a referring physician does not meet the requirements of a Stark Law exception, then the physician is prohibited from making Medicare and Medicaid referrals to the laboratory and any such referrals will result in overpayments to the laboratory and subject the laboratory to the Stark Law’s penalties. 
 Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare referrals. The Stark Law also prohibits state receipt of federal Medicaid matching funds for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral, but this provision of the Stark Law has not been implemented by regulations. In addition, some courts have held that the submission of claims to Medicaid that would be prohibited as self-referrals under the Stark Law for Medicare could implicate the False Claims Act. 
 Physician Sunshine Laws 
 The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them and in some cases their distributors to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reporting program (Open Payments program) is administered by CMS under regulations issued for the program. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We may become subject to such reporting requirements under the terms of current CMS regulations, however, if the FDA requires us to obtain premarket clearance or approval for our tests. 
 Anti-Bribery Laws 
 FCPA 
 We are subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. The sale of our tests internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining, implementing and enforcing a policy against participation in corrupt activity. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields have faced substantial monetary fines and criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with non-U.S. government officials. 
Foreign Laws 
 We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act of 2010, which became effective in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public or private nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act of 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years and could be subject to an unlimited fine, as could commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery. 
Healthcare Policy Laws 
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States. The Affordable Care Act made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private insurers. For example, the Affordable Care Act requires each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. The medical device tax has been suspended by Congress through 2019. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the provision of our LDTs will trigger the medical device tax, and it is possible that this tax will apply to some or all of our existing tests or tests we may develop in the future. It is also possible that the medical device tax will be repealed by Congress. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to propose reductions to payments in order to

reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if expenditures exceed certain targets. The expenditure targets for IPAB proposals have not been exceeded at this time, and it is unclear when such targets may be exceeded in the future, when any IPAB-proposed reductions to payments could take effect and how any such reductions would affect reimbursement payments for our tests. The Affordable Care Act also contains a number of other provisions, including provisions governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement matters and fraud and abuse, which we expect will impact our industry and our operations in ways that we cannot currently predict. Following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and in light of the policies of the current administration, which has threatened to repeal the Affordable Care Act, there is uncertainty regarding the continued effect or the Affordable Care Act in its current form. 
 Corporate Practice of Medicine 
 Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining the appropriate diagnostic tests for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of a patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against the business corporation and/or the professional through licensure proceedings. Typically, such laws are only applicable to entities with a physical presence in the applicable state. 
Environmental and Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Our laboratory is subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds and blood and other tissue specimens. Typically, we use licensed or otherwise qualified outside vendors to dispose of this waste. However, many of these laws and regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. As a result, we could be held liable for damages and fines if our, or others’, business operations or other actions result in contamination of the environment or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous materials. Our costs for complying with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated or predicted and depends on a number of factors, including the amount and nature of waste we produce (which depends in part on the number of tests we perform) and the terms we negotiate with our waste disposal vendors. 
 Our operations are also subject to extensive requirements established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration relating to workplace safety for healthcare employees, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries. 
 Employees 
 We believe growing and retaining a strong team is crucial to our success. As of March 1, 2019, we had 123 employees, all of which are full-time, engaged in bioinformatics, genetics, software engineering, laboratory management, sales and marketing and corporate and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
Corporate Information
 We were incorporated in Delaware on May 13, 2016. We are the holding company of our subsidiaries, including primarily Fulgent LLC, which was initially formed in June 2011. On September 30, 2016, Fulgent LLC became our wholly owned subsidiary in a transaction we refer to as the Reorganization, in which the holders of all equity interests in Fulgent LLC immediately prior to the Reorganization became all of our stockholders immediately following the Reorganization. 
 Our initial operations focused on Fulgent LLC’s former pharmaceutical business, or the Pharma Business, and in 2013 we commenced the genetic testing business we are currently pursuing. In October 2015, we recapitalized Fulgent LLC to establish two series of units, with the Class D units having economic rights based on the genetic testing business we are currently pursuing and the Class P units having economic rights based on the Pharma Business. On April 4, 2016, Fulgent LLC separated the Pharma Business from the genetic testing business we are currently pursuing in a transaction we refer to as the Pharma Split-Off. The operating results of the Pharma Business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
