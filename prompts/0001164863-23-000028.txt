We routinely evaluate the need to protect new and existing products through the patent and trademark systems in the U.S. and other countries. We also have unpatented proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets relating to the design, manufacture and operation of our products and their use, and to certain services we perform. Except for proprietary formulations and know-how in our Advanced Surface Technologies segment, we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent on any particular patent, patent right, trademark, trade secret or license granted or group of related patents, patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses granted.
In general, we are the owner of the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell. However, we also license certain intellectual property from various entities. These licenses are subject to renewal and it is possible we may not successfully renegotiate these licenses or they could be terminated in the event of a material breach. If this were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 3,500 employees, of which approximately 68% are in North America, 12% in Europe, and 20% in Asia Pacific. 
We strive to create an environment where all employees can flourish and develop, and view human development as a basic right, and a core foundation to achieving excellence. At Enpro, development of our colleagues leads to excellence, and creates an environment that drives strong financial performance. Safety, excellence and respect are our enduring core values and are the standard by which we measure all of our actions, including how we treat our colleagues. 
In 2023, we are introducing a new performance management and development process, placing emphasis on both manager engagement and employee ownership. We regularly conduct employee engagement and satisfaction surveys, including one completed in early 2023. Results from these surveys and engagement activities drive advances in senior management focus to continuously improve our culture and way of working. 
Focus on Safety and Wellbeing of our Employees. Our core value of safety, includes physical safety on our factory floors, and also the wellness and psychological safety of all colleagues. We have worked for many years to develop a world-class safety program and culture, where the intention is that each employee goes home each day as healthy as they arrived. Our commitment to safety has resulted in our being the only public company to have been recognized on three separate occasions by EHS Today as “America’s Safest Company”. Each year, we enhance our safety culture and programs. In 2023, we are 
implementing new safety onboarding programs so that our newest colleagues can thoroughly understand our safety culture and expectations, which is often unique from any place they have worked before. 
Competitive Pay, Benefits and Equity: We provide comprehensive compensation and benefits programs that are designed to attract and retain colleagues – our most valuable resource. Our compensation programs include a focus on building long-term value and alignment with our stakeholders, including a significant portion of compensation at appropriate levels designed to foster a culture of ownership and alignment with our shareholders. We have improved these our benefit programs each year to meet the changing needs of our employees and their families. In the United States, this includes a company-wide minimum wage of $15 per hour, a 401k plan with above-market company match, an award-winning health and wellbeing program, flexible vacation and time off policies, enhanced employee assistance programs, paid family leave, and comprehensive healthcare benefits, as well as company-paid long-term disability, critical illness, and accident coverage. 
We continue to focus on the mental wellbeing of our colleagues through company-wide resource groups that focus on mental health and inclusion, as well as through our employee assistance programs. 
Focus on Diversity and Respect. A diverse workforce, as well as a commitment to diverse thinking, is critical to our long-term growth and success. We continue to utilize inclusive practices within our talent acquisition practices, including diverse candidate slates and diverse interview panels. We have implemented tools and structures to reduce bias during the interview and selection process, including unconscious bias training. We provided Diversity Without Division to our first line supervisors in 2022 with planned roll-out to all supervisors and managers in 2023. Our gender and ethnic/racial diversity including senior management and through two levels down is 46% diverse, a testament to our focus on creating a diverse and inclusive environment, and one with opportunity for growth and development. 
The positive impact of our care, compassion and flexible programs is demonstrated by our employee retention rates. In a market with volatile turnover, our retention rates are at or above market level, in part due to our culture and progressive approach. 
Focus on the Communities and our New Employee Assistance Fund. In 2020, we launched the Enpro Foundation to support charitable organizations in the communities where our colleagues live and work. Enpro contributed $1.5 million to the Enpro Foundation since formation in 2020 and our Foundation has made $356,000 in donations, with a special focus on charitable organizations where our colleagues are directly involved. Through our Foundation, we have created and funded an employee assistance fund, administered by a third-party specializing in this area, where we can confidentially assist employees undergoing tragedy in a way that is objective and respectful.
