     Item 1. Business
 ﻿
 Overview 
 ﻿
 ICC Holdings, Inc. is a Pennsylvania corporation that was organized in 2016. As used in this Form 10-K, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the consolidated group. On a stand-alone basis ICC Holdings, Inc. is referred to as the “Parent Company.” The consolidated group consists of the holding company, ICC Holdings, Inc.; ICC Realty, LLC, a real estate services and holding company; Beverage Insurance Agency, Inc., an inactive insurance agency; Estrella Innovative Solutions, Inc., an outsourcing company; and Illinois Casualty Company (ICC,) an operating insurance company. ICC is an Illinois domiciled company.
 ﻿
 ICC Holdings, Inc. was formed so that it could acquire all of the capital stock of ICC in a mutual-to-stock conversion. The plan of conversion was approved by ICC policyholders at a special meeting on March 17, 2017. Simultaneously, surplus notes totaling $1.65 million were converted into 165,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company’s offering closed on March 24, 2017, and our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) purchased 350,000 of the shares in the offering. On March 28, 2017, the Company’s stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol “ICCH”. Proceeds received from the offering net of offering costs and underwriting fees was $28.7 million. Prior to the conversion on March 24, 2017, the Parent Company did not engage in any operations. 
 ﻿
 We are a specialty insurance carrier primarily underwriting commercial multi-peril, liquor liability, workers’ compensation, and umbrella liability coverages for the food and beverage industry through our subsidiary insurance company, ICC. ICC writes business in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin and markets through independent agents. Approximately 29.7% and 33.7% of the premium was written in Illinois for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. ICC sold its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Beverage Insurance Agency, Inc. and Estrella Innovative Solutions, Inc. to the Parent Company during the second quarter of 2018. ICC sold ICC Realty, LLC to the Parent Company during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company operates as a single segment.
 ﻿
 We primarily market our products through a network of 176 independent agents in the states that we write in. ICC has been assigned, as of April 27, 2018, a “B++” (Good) financial strength rating by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (A.M. Best), which is the fifth highest out of fifteen possible ratings. ICC’s most recent evaluation by A.M. Best is occurring on March 27, 2019 and therefore the ratings from this evaluation will not be available at the time of this report. ICC’s prior evaluation with A.M. Best occurred on March 29, 2018, when A.M. Best affirmed its Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of “B++” and upgraded the Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) to “bbb+” from “bbb” (Good). At that time, the outlook of the FSR as well as the Long-Term ICR is stable. A.M. Best also upgraded the Long-Term ICR to “bb+” from “bb” of ICC Holdings, Inc. The outlook assigned, as of April 27, 2018, to the credit rating of the Company is stable. 
 ﻿
 Since inception, ICC has specialized in providing customized insurance products and aggressive claims defense for customers exclusively in the food and beverage industry. 
 ﻿
 ICC was founded as an inter-insurance exchange in 1950 based upon the recognition that establishments serving alcohol require unique insurance protection. Beginning in 1998, we expanded the scope of our product offerings beyond liquor liability to include property, general liability, and umbrella. Workers compensation coverage was added in 2007. Our goal is to meet the full range of business insurance needs of our clients in the food and beverage industry. 
 ﻿
 In 1999, ICC recognized the significant need to automate. Upon determining available commercial software was inadequate to meet our long-term vision, we contracted the development of an integrated platform to handle agency, policy, and vendor management. Introduced in 2001, the first module successfully improved productivity and reporting capabilities. We built on that success by adding document imaging, claims, billing, and risk management modules. As it has grown, our information management system has provided us with a unique and comprehensive ability to automate processes, track and examine risk traits, and monitor claims development. As a result, ICC has constructed and leveraged a multi-variant pricing algorithm that allows us to better analyze our business in order to more effectively price to actual exposure. 
 ﻿
 ICC mutualized in 2004 and began to expand its territory geographically within the Midwest. We are an admitted carrier in 13 states: Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. As we expanded our territory and product lines, we have maintained our focus and commitment to the food and beverage industry. As a result, we have developed an expertise in our niche, particularly within the areas of underwriting, loss control, and claims management. ICC continues to leverage that experience into the ongoing development of innovative insurance products and services uniquely tailored to the food and beverage industry.

     Competitive Growth Strategies 
 ﻿
 Technology – We believe that existing and developing technology and information systems are and will continue to impact the insurance industry’s use of risk analysis in the underwriting process, provide tools for reduction of claims, and modernize the claims handling process. As part of our focus, we have internally developed a completely integrated policy management system. This system allows us to leverage loss control data for predictive analytics in both the claims and underwriting areas. For example, in the underwriting area, we create pricing models taking into account the unique characteristics of our customers, with industry-specific variables such as latest hour of close, type and frequency of on-site entertainment, and average alcoholic beverage pricing. We also have achieved better efficiency by moving to a more paperless organization and integrated off-site employees in our claims, underwriting, accounting, loss control and IT development areas. We intend to remain a leader in the industry in utilizing technology and data analysis to price our coverage based on the risk assumed, reduce accidents and provide prompt claims response. 
 ﻿
 Industry Expertise – We have been providing the food and beverage industry with insurance products and services since 1950. By leveraging our experience, we better understand our customers and their needs, which allows us to better price our products and services and defend claims aggressively and economically, using the experience of our in-house legal department and an established network of specialized defense attorneys. As a result, we are the exclusively endorsed property and liability insurance provider for the Indiana Restaurant and Lodging Association, the Illinois Licensed Beverage Association, the Minnesota Licensed Beverage Association, Hospitality Business Alliance, and the Tavern League of Colorado. We also provide insurance agents with continuing education on industry topics, such as liquor liability, kitchen fire prevention, and alcohol server training. For policyholders serving liquor, we provide certified alcohol server training as a value-added service and risk elimination/mitigation tool. Our employees are also regular panel speakers at local and national claims conferences. 
 ﻿
 Enterprise Risk Management – As part of our effort to grow responsibly, we have put in place a cross-functional, multi-dimensional enterprise risk management program. The program is focused on financial, organization, operational, tactical, market and legal risks and managed at three different levels: the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors, our internal enterprise risk management committee and our internal audit committee. The focus of the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors along with our actuarial manager is on oversight, top tier risk, emerging risks, and risk optimization. The internal enterprise risk committee is comprised of our senior management team, which is focused on conducting a review of all risks attendant to the Company at least annually; rating triaged risks for severity, frequency, and control; completing risk control reports for stress testing, risk tolerance, and mitigation plans; measuring and monitoring risk on an ongoing basis; and tying enterprise risk management to individual performance evaluations and compensation. In early 2018, the Company, working with its reinsurance broker, completed its first economic capital model for the insurance operations at ICC. Our internal audit function focuses on policy and procedure compliance and mitigation plans. 
 ﻿
 Growth Strategies 
 ﻿
 While we have established a significant market share in our existing territories, we believe that there is still opportunity for growth within our existing footprint. We will continue to seek out insurance agency partners who have a commitment to our niche and an ability to sell the value represented by our products. Our long-term growth plan also involves expanding geographically into states where we believe current insurance laws provide an attractive market within our niche for our existing products and services. We expanded into Colorado and Kansas during 2017, became licensed in Oregon and Pennsylvania during 2017 and became licensed in Tennessee in 2018. We began writing premium in Michigan during the second quarter of 2018. We will consider geographic expansion opportunities that allow us to leverage existing agency relationships whose footprints overlap our own. Growth opportunities will always be carefully evaluated with long term profitability at the forefront of the decision making process. 
 ﻿
 Although we do not have any current plans or intent to expand or grow our business by acquisition, we will consider opportunities that are presented to us. 


      ~ 5 ~

 
     Reaction to Market Cycles 
 ﻿
 Many insurance companies sporadically target businesses within our niche; however, a relatively small number make a long-term commitment to the niche through changing insurance market cycles. When the insurance market is “hard” and premium growth is achievable in less specialized segments, many carriers exit this niche. Large and diversified insurance carriers have the ability to shift their focus and resources to less challenging areas. When market conditions “soften,” those same carriers often aggressively move back into our niche for premium growth. Because we specialize in the niche, we do not shift resources to other market segments. Therefore, the Company generally maintains pricing stability throughout market cycles by relying on our strong loss control, underwriting and claims expertise, and our customer service commitment. We react to market cycles by adjusting our appetite for risks based on pricing and cycle conditions, but we maintain a consistent commitment to the food and beverage industry. Due to the relatively small number of insurance companies that make a long-term commitment to this niche, the insurance market does not fluctuate to the same extent as the insurance market for the general commercial market. 
 ﻿
 Our Challenges 
 ﻿
 Our business faces significant challenges that can impede our goal of growing our business while realizing operating profits, including the following: 
 ﻿
 Estimating Our Loss Reserves. 
 ﻿
 We maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses and settlement expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. These reserves represent management’s estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. Pursuant to applicable insurance regulations, these reserves are reviewed by an independent actuary on at least an annual basis. Setting reserves is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that current or future reserves will prove adequate. If our loss reserves are inadequate, it will have an unfavorable impact on our results. See Item 1. Business — Losses and Settlement Expense for a summary of the favorable and unfavorable developments in our loss reserves in the previous 10-year period. 
 ﻿
 Reliance on Independent Agents. 
 ﻿
 Our product is distributed through a contracted network of independent insurance agents. Independent agents are typically contracted with a number of insurance carriers. The producers within an agency will determine which product is most appropriate to recommend to their client or prospective client. The agency will select a product based on a variety of factors such as: premium; coverage; service including billing and claims; agency compensation and agency/company relationship. Establishing and maintaining long term financially successful agency relationships is very important to the long term success of a company. 
 ﻿
 Maintaining Our Financial Strength Ratings. 
 ﻿
 In April 2018, A.M. Best affirmed ICC’s financial strength rating of “B++” stable outlook. A key to achieving our goal of significant growth in our premiums written, is obtaining an A.M. Best rating of “A-” or better. Increasing our capitalization and maintaining strong operating performance, are significant rating components reviewed by A.M. Best. This is combined with a review of various other rating requirements. If we are not able to increase our rating or if A.M. Best downgrades our rating, it is likely that we will not be able to compete as effectively and our ability to sell insurance policies could decline. As a result, our financial results would be adversely affected. A.M. Best reviews our rating approximately once per year. 
 ﻿
 Attracting, Developing and Retaining Experienced Personnel. 
 ﻿
 To sustain our growth as a property and casualty insurance company operating in a specialty niche market, we must continue to attract, develop and retain management, marketing, distribution, underwriting, customer service, and claims personnel with expertise in the products we offer. The loss of key personnel, or our inability to recruit, develop and retain additional qualified personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, growth and profitability. 
 ﻿


      ~ 6 ~

 
     Competitive Strengths 
 ﻿
 Our opportunity for growth is driven by our competitive strengths, which include the following: 
 ﻿
 Use of Data and Metrics to Improve our Underwriting Results. 
 ﻿
 Our analysis of data available through both governmental and other industry resources, combined with our internal data, drive our underwriting and pricing decisions. We have developed a multi-variant risk grading system and pricing algorithm that combines both objective and subjective inputs that drive both whether to provide coverage and pricing. This information helps us avoid providing coverage to higher risk insureds while improving our overall risk profile. Most risks we insure are inspected within the first 60 days of policy binding, which permits us to cancel the policy if we determine that the insured is not an acceptable risk or pricing is inadequate. Each inspection consists of an extensive risk profile questionnaire as well as 25 to 100 pictures of the insured’s place of business. We believe this approach reduces claims frequency. 
 ﻿
 Focus on niche food and beverage business. 
 ﻿
 We target niche markets within the food and beverage industry that support adequate pricing and believe we are able to adapt to changing market needs ahead of our competitors through our strategic focus. We develop and deliver specialty insurance products priced to meet our customers’ needs and strive to generate consistent underwriting profit. We believe that our extensive experience and expertise specific to underwriting and claims management in the food and beverage industry will allow continued loss ratio improvement in 2019 and going forward. The Company is committed to retaining this underwriting and claim handling expertise as a core competency as the volume of business increases. 
 ﻿
 Strong market presence with name recognition and long-standing producer relationships. 
 ﻿
 We have been writing insurance for the food and beverage industry in Illinois since 1950. Approximately 29.7% of current direct premium is written in Illinois, during the year ended December 31, 2018.    ﻿
 Great care is taken in building the ICC brand in all states of operation and the Company holds significant market share in nearly all states serviced. ICC acknowledges that each state, each agency and each customer is unique. A commitment to quality of product and services is universally important and recognized. 
 ﻿
 Scalable operations positioned for growth. 
 ﻿
 We are focused on automation and operating efficiencies across its core functional areas. We have consistently increased premium per full time equivalent employee for five consecutive years and are positioned to continue that trend with current growth plans. We believe we are well-positioned in both terms of personnel and systems to increase written premiums and to expand into new geographic markets with better than industry level profitability using the efficient operating infrastructure we have developed.    ﻿
 Experienced management team. 
 ﻿
 We are managed by an experienced group of executives led by Arron K. Sutherland, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Sutherland has served in his current position since June 2010, joined ICC in 2006 and has worked in the insurance industry for over 22 years. Michael R. Smith, our Vice President – Chief Financial Officer, has served with ICC since 2011. Mr. Smith has more than 22 years of experience in the insurance industry. Howard J. Beck, our Vice President – Chief Underwriting Officer, has been with ICC since 2004 and has over 25 years of underwriting experience. Norman D. Schmeichel, our Vice President – Chief Information Officer, has served with ICC since 2002. Mr. Schmeichel has more than 22 years’ experience in information technologies and 15 years’ experience in the insurance industry. Additionally, Julia B. Suiter, our Chief Legal Officer, has served with ICC since 2009 and has over 22 years’ experience in insurance defense and contract law. Kathleen S. Springer, our Chief Human Resources Officer, has served with ICC since 2008 and has over 22 years’ experience in benefits, compensation, and talent acquisition and more than 9 years’ experience in the insurance industry. Rickey Plunkett, our Director of Claims, has served with ICC since 2010 and has over 37 years of experience in the claims field. As a group, our executive officers have on average more than 20 years’ experience in the property and casualty insurance industry.
 ﻿

     Products 
 ﻿
 ICC has specialized in the food and beverage industry since 1950. Our product language is based on Insurance Services Offices (ISO) forms, which is an industry standard, but tailored to the specific needs of our clients. We began by writing liquor liability or dram shop insurance and that remains a prominent line of business today. Commercial property and liability are written in a single policy as a business owners policy (BOP). ICC also writes workers compensation and commercial umbrella policies which are written as complementary lines to the BOP and liquor liability and are not offered on a stand-alone basis. As of December 31, 2018, ICC had 5,926 BOP policies, 5,707 liquor liability policies, 2,167 worker’s compensation policies and 1,522 commercial umbrella policies. 90.5% of BOP policies and 90.2% of liquor liability policies are for either restaurants or taverns. While we do not currently write commercial auto insurance, we do insure risks associated with the delivery of food or beverage. 
 ﻿
 Marketing and Distribution 
 ﻿
 Our commercial insurance product is sold by over 176 independent insurance. These agencies access multiple insurance companies and are typically established businesses in the communities in which they operate. We view these agents as our primary customers because they are in a position to recommend either our insurance products or those of a competitor to their customers. We consider our relationships with these agencies to be a core strength of the Company. 
 ﻿
 We manage our producers through quarterly business reviews utilizing various internally generated reports. Our quantitative agency review (QAR) measures each agency on a variety of weighted metrics and ranks them from high to low. The measurement is updated on a weekly basis and is available for all company employees’ review. 
 ﻿
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, only one of our producers was responsible for more than 5% of our direct premiums written and our top 10 producers accounted for approximately 38.4% of direct premiums written.
 ﻿
 Our agency partners are supported by our Marketing Department. These representatives also identify and train new agents. We conduct regularly scheduled webinars for agents as well as onsite training on company products and services. These include technical training about our products as well as sales training to effectively market our products. We also offer our agents industry specific training that qualifies for continuing education credit for state insurance license requirements. 
 ﻿
 Agents are compensated through a fixed base commission with an opportunity for profit sharing depending on the producer’s premiums written and profitability. Agents receive commission as a percentage of premiums (generally 15% for most lines, except worker’s compensation policies which are generally at 7.5%) as their primary compensation from us. We offer a contingent compensation plan as an incentive for producers to place high-quality business with us and to support our loss control efforts. We believe that the contingent compensation paid to our producers is comparable with those offered by other insurance companies and is designed to reward agents for growth and profitability. 
 ﻿
 Our marketing efforts are also supported by our claims, litigation, billing, underwriting and loss control departments. As industry specialists, we are able to offer expertise in all interactions with agents and/or policyholders. For example, our claims philosophy is to provide prompt and efficient service and claims processing, resulting in a positive experience for both the agents and policyholders. We take an aggressive, defense-oriented position on third party liability claims which is recognized and appreciated by our policyholders. We believe that these positive experiences result in higher policyholder retention and create new business opportunities for our agents. While we rely on our agents for front line distribution and customer support, underwriting, billing, loss control and claim handling responsibilities are retained by us. Many of our agents have had direct relationships with us for a number of years. 
 ﻿
 Underwriting, Risk Assessment and Pricing 
 ﻿
 Our underwriting philosophy is aimed at consistently generating profits through sound risk selection, stringent loss control and pricing discipline. One key element in sound risk selection is our use of risk characteristic metrics. Through our practice of focused underwriting, we have identified predictive metrics of data that many other insurance companies do not recognize or measure. Use of these metrics allows us to more effectively price risks, thereby improving our profitability and allowing us to compete favorably with other insurance carriers. We also are very active in leveraging our onsite loss control inspections. An example would be the monitoring of kitchen fire suppression systems servicing to reduce kitchen fire losses. 
 ﻿
 Our philosophy is to understand our industry and be disciplined in our underwriting efforts. We will not compromise profitability for top line growth.
 ﻿


      ~ 8 ~

 
     Our competitive strategy in underwriting is: 

· | Maximize the use of available information acquired through a wide variety of industry resources.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Allow our internal metrics and rating to establish risk pricing and use sound underwriting judgement for risk selection and pricing modification.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilize our risk grading system, which combines both objective and subjective inputs, to quantify desirability of risks and improve our overall risk profile.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Physically inspect most new insured within the first 60 days of policy binding with our in-house loss control representatives. Our inspection consists of an extensive risk profile questionnaire and includes 25 to 100 electronic photos of the insured’s place of business. Inspections that demonstrate that a risk is not desirable is a basis for revoking coverage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provide very high-quality service to our agents and insureds by responding quickly and effectively to information requests and policy submissions. Treat our agents as partners and have the same expectation of them.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our Underwriting Department works in teams with each agent assigned to one of three teams. We underwrite our accounts by evaluating each risk with consistently applied standards. Each policy undergoes a thorough evaluation process prior to every renewal. 
 ﻿
 Our underwriting staff of 25 employees has an average of 12 years of insurance industry experience. Howard J. Beck, our Vice President – Chief Underwriting Officer, has been with ICC since 2004 and has over 25 years of insurance experience with 22 years of property and casualty underwriting experience. 
 ﻿
 We strive to be disciplined in our pricing by pursuing targeted rate changes to continually improve our underwriting profitability while still being able to attract and retain profitable customers. Our pricing reviews involve evaluating our claims experience, loss trends, data acquired from inspections, applications and other data sources to identify characteristics that drive the frequency and severity of our claims. These results drive changes to rates and rating metrics as well as understanding what portions of our business are most profitable. 
 ﻿
 This knowledge and analysis enables us to price risks accurately, improve account retention, and drive profitable new business. 
 ﻿
 Claims and Litigation Management 
 ﻿
 Our claims team supports our underwriting strategy by working to provide a timely, good faith claims handling response to our policyholders. Claims excellence is achieved by timely investigation and handling of claims, settlement of meritorious claims for equitable amounts, maintenance of adequate case reserves, and control of claims loss settlement expenses. 
 ﻿
 Claims on insurance policies are received directly from the insured or through our independent agents. Our Claims Department supports our producer relationship strategy by working to provide a consistently responsive level of claim service to our policyholders. 
 ﻿
 Chief Legal Officer, Julia Suiter, provides oversight of our Claims and Legal Departments.  She has over 22 years’ experience in insurance defense litigation and contract law. Ms. Suiter, supervises a Legal Department staff that includes an Associate Litigation Manager, a Litigation Counsel, and a Paralegal.  Rickey Plunkett, our Director of Claims, supervises a staff of 17 employees with considerable years of experience in processing property and casualty insurance claims. Mr. Plunkett joined ICC in 2010 and has over 37 years of experience in claims management.
 ﻿
 Technology 
 ﻿
 Our technology efforts are focused on supporting our strategy of differentiating ourselves from our competitors through use of data mining, business intelligence solutions, and data analysis to determine profitability of new and existing business and to better price risks that we underwrite. 
 ﻿
 We have streamlined internal processes to achieve operational efficiencies through the implementation of a policy and claim imaging and workflow system. This system provides online access to electronic copies of policies, quotes, inspections, and any other correspondence enabling our associates to quickly and efficiently underwrite policies, adjust claims, and respond to our producers’ inquiries. 
 ﻿


      ~ 9 ~

 
     Since the system integrates all aspects of the policy life cycle, from underwriting to billing to claims, we are able to better automate all internal workflows through electronic routing thus lowering costs and providing better service to our customers. This system allows us to leverage loss control data for predictive analytics in both the claims and underwriting areas. For example, in the underwriting area, we can create pricing models taking into account the unique characteristics of our customers, such as neighborhoods, entertainment on site and average alcoholic beverage pricing. 
 ﻿
 We have implemented best in class virus or malware protections while still enabling our employees to work from any location. We are tested on a periodic basis to ensure our protections are sufficient. 
 ﻿
 We have the ability to scale since we are almost entirely a paperless organization. This allows us to integrate off-site employees just as if they are in the office. We intend to remain a leader in the industry by utilizing technology and data analysis to price our coverage based on the risk assumed and to both reduce accidents and provide a prompt response to claims. 
 ﻿
 As part of our disaster recovery program, we utilize a third party backup software package to provide a complete copy of our production systems at an off-site location that is updated on a daily basis. We also have a generator that will allow the home office to operate in the event that power or access to our headquarters is disrupted. We test this disaster recovery plan bi-annually as well as continually expand its capabilities to eliminate business interruption to the best of our ability. 
 ﻿
 Reinsurance 
 ﻿
 In accordance with insurance industry practice, we reinsure a portion of our exposure and pay to the reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on all policies reinsured. Insurance policies written by us are reinsured with other insurance companies principally to: 
· | reduce net liability on individual risks;
--+------------------------------------------


· | mitigate the effect of individual loss occurrences (including catastrophic losses);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | stabilize underwriting results;
--+--------------------------------


· | decrease leverage; and
--+-----------------------


· | increase our underwriting capacity.
--+------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Reinsurance can be facultative or treaty. Under facultative reinsurance, each policy or portion of a risk is reinsured individually. Under treaty reinsurance, an agreed-upon portion of a class of business is automatically reinsured. Reinsurance also can be classified as quota share reinsurance, pro rata reinsurance or excess of loss reinsurance. Under quota share reinsurance and pro rata reinsurance, the insurance company issuing the policy cedes a percentage of its insurance liability to the reinsurer in exchange for a like percentage of premiums, less a ceding commission. The company issuing the policy in turn recovers from the reinsurer the reinsurer’s share of all loss and settlement expenses incurred on those risks. Under excess of loss reinsurance, an insurer limits its liability to all or a particular portion of the amount in excess of a predetermined deductible or retention. Regardless of type, reinsurance does not legally discharge the insurance company issuing the policy from primary liability for the full amount due under the reinsured policies. However, the assuming reinsurer is obligated to reimburse the company issuing the policy to the extent of the coverage ceded. 
 ﻿
 We determine the amount and scope of reinsurance coverage to purchase each year based on a number of factors. These factors include the evaluation of the risks accepted, consultations with reinsurance intermediates and a review of market conditions, including the availability and pricing of reinsurance. A primary factor in the selection of reinsurers from whom we purchase reinsurance is their financial strength. Our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually. We expect an 18.1% decrease in spend for our 2019 reinsurance contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we ceded to reinsurers $11.3 million of written premiums, compared to $8.0 million of written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Term | Meaning 
1 @ x% | “1” refers to the number of times that we reinstate the coverage. The number prior to the “%” sign indicates the overall cost to us when reinstating coverage. 
AAD | This is short for Aggregate Annual Deductible. Aggregate annual deductible is the maximum amount ICC needs to pay within a policy period before their reinsurer pays for covered losses. 
Aggregate Catastrophe | An aggregate catastrophe treaty is a reinsurance cover designed to help us manage the effects of multiple extreme weather events on our results. 
Basket Coverage | Excess liability reinsurance that attaches once retained losses in combined property and casualty occurrences (i.e. those that involve BOP property and BOP liability, or Liquor Liability or Workers Compensation or Hired and Non-owned Auto) exceed $1m. If ICC has an occurrence where the combined property and casualty retention is greater than $1m then the company would recover up to $1m of loss in excess of that $1m retention. The basket coverage limits the company’s retention in any one combined occurrence to $1m and not the combined separate retentions provided for in the casualty reinsurance ($1.0 million), Workers Compensation reinsurance ($500,000), Hired and non-owned auto reinsurance ($750,000) and Property reinsurance ($500,000). 
Casualty | For this chart, this refers to our liquor liability, business owners liability, workers compensation and any umbrella policies. 
Free & Unlimited | This refers to the number and cost of reinstating the reinsurance coverage. With this wording, each separate loss occurrences above the retention will be covered by the treaty. 
Inures | Our Workers Compensation Reinsurance contracts are first applied to reduce the loss subject to the Casualty XOL contract and are said to inure to the benefit of the Casualty XOL contract. 
MAOL | This reinsurance sublimit puts a cap on the maximum loss any one life/claimant can contribute to the reinsurance recoverable. 
Per Risk | Reinsurance in which the reinsurance limit and our loss retention apply “per risk,” rather than per accident, per event, or in the aggregate. 
Retention | The amount of loss and settlement expense retained by us either per occurrence on casualty losses or per risk on property claims 
WC | This is short for Workers Compensation. 
XOL | This is short for Excess of Loss reinsurance coverage. 
XS | This is short for Excess. For example, our Property per Risk tower has three separate contracts providing coverage. The top layer in that tower provides $7.0 million coverage for each risk for losses in excess of $5.0 million. 

  ﻿


      ~ 11 ~

 
     We retain the first $500,000 of workers compensation losses. Losses in excess of the $500,000 are covered under our workers compensation excess of loss program (WC XOL Tower) up to $1.0 million. Losses above the $1.0 million are then covered under the second workers compensation treaty through $10.0 million. Above $10.0 million, losses would fall back to the casualty tower for an additional $5.0 million of coverage per employee. Losses above $15.0 million are covered under a workers compensation cover that provides $10.0 million in excess of $15.0 million. We have an additional cover that provideds $32.5 million of coverage in excess of $25.0 million for four direct policies issued by the Company. 
 ﻿
 Casualty risks (Casualty XOL Tower) (business owners, liability, liquor liability, umbrella) are covered for $10.0 million in loss above a $1.0 million retention for each loss occurrence. 
 ﻿
 Property per risk excess of loss program (Property Per Risk XOL Tower) provides coverage above our $500,000 retention up to $12.0 million on a treaty basis and facultative for a few risks above that to their full limits. 
 ﻿
 Property catastrophe reinsurance (Section A Property Cat Occurrence) provides coverage in any one event for $15.0 million of loss in excess of our $500,000 retention. 
 ﻿
 We also have aggregate catastrophe protection (Section B Aggregate Catastrophe) in the event that catastrophe losses retained by us exceeds $1.5 million in such year. This program allows us to aggregate storms losses where losses exceed $50,000 but fall below the $500,000 occurrence retention. 
 ﻿
 The insolvency or inability of any reinsurer to meet its obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our reinsurance providers, the majority of whom are longstanding partners who understand our business, are all carefully selected with the help of our reinsurance broker. We monitor the solvency of reinsurers through regular review of their financial statements and, if available, their A.M. Best ratings. All of our reinsurance partners have at least an “A-” rating from A.M. Best. According to A.M. Best, companies with a rating of “A-” or better “have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders.”

      Losses and Settlement Expense Reserves 
 ﻿
 We are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations to maintain reserves for payment of loss and settlement expenses. These reserves are established for both reported claims and for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR), arising from the policies we have issued. The laws and regulations require that provision be made for the ultimate cost of those claims without regard to how long it takes to settle them or the time value of money. The determination of reserves involves actuarial and statistical projections of what we expect to be the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of such claims. The reserves are set based on facts and circumstances then known, estimates of future trends in claims severity, and other variable factors such as inflation and changing judicial theories of liability. 
 ﻿


      ~ 12 ~

 
     Estimating the ultimate liability for losses and settlement expense is an inherently uncertain process. Therefore, the reserve for losses and settlement expense does not represent an exact calculation of that liability. Our reserve policy recognizes this uncertainty by maintaining reserves at a level providing for the possibility of adverse development relative to the estimation process. We do not discount our reserves to recognize the time value of money. 
 ﻿
 When a claim is reported to us, our claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment. This estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of our claims staff. In estimating the appropriate reserve, our claims staff considers the nature and value of the specific claim, the severity of injury or damage, and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss. Case reserves are adjusted by our claims staff as more information becomes available. It is our policy to resolve each claim as expeditiously as possible. 
 ﻿
 We maintain IBNR reserves to provide for already incurred claims that have not yet been reported and developments on reported claims. The IBNR reserve is determined by estimating our ultimate net liability for both reported and IBNR claims and then subtracting the case reserves and paid loss and settlement expense for reported claims. 
 ﻿
 Each quarter, we compute our estimated ultimate liability using principles and procedures applicable to the lines of business written. However, because the establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process, we cannot provide assurance that ultimate losses will not exceed the established loss reserves. Adjustments in aggregate reserves, if any, are reflected in the operating results of the period during which such adjustments are made. 
 ﻿
 The following table provides information about open claims, reserves, and paid loss and settlement expense on a direct basis only:

     ﻿
 The estimation process for determining the liability for unpaid losses and settlement expense inherently results in adjustments each year for claims incurred (but not paid) in preceding years. Negative amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for claims incurred related to prior years are a result of claims being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated (unfavorable or adverse development). 
 ﻿
 Reconciliation of Reserve for Loss and Settlement Expenses 
 ﻿
 The following table shows the development of our reserves for unpaid loss and settlement expense from 2009 through 2018 on a GAAP basis. The top line of the table shows the liabilities at the balance sheet date, including losses incurred but not yet reported. The upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amounts subsequently paid as of successive years with respect to the liability. The lower portion of the table shows the reestimated amount of the previously recorded liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimates change as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The redundancy (deficiency) exists when the reestimated liability for each reporting period is less (greater) than the prior liability estimate. The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” depicted in the table, for any particular calendar year, represents the aggregate change in the initial estimates over all subsequent calendar years. 
 ﻿
 Gross deficiencies and redundancies may be significantly more or less than net deficiencies and redundancies due to the nature and extent of applicable reinsurance.

     As noted in the table below, since 2008 the Company has principally selected initial ultimate loss picks that have proven to be redundant over time.

  Investments 
 ﻿
 Our investments in debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a component of equity net of taxes. The goal of our investment activities is to complement and support our overall mission. As such, the investment portfolio’s goal is to maximize after-tax investment income and price appreciation while maintaining the portfolio’s target risk profile. 
 ﻿
 An important component of our operating results has been the return on invested assets. Our investment objectives are (i) to preserve and grow capital and surplus, in order to improve our competitive position and allow for expansion of insurance operations; (ii) to ensure sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund expected liability payments and otherwise support our underwriting strategy; (iii) to provide a reasonable and stable level of income; and (iv) to maintain a portfolio which will assist in attaining the highest possible rating from A.M. Best. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Quantitative and Qualitative Information about Market Risk.    ﻿
 In addition to any investments prohibited by the insurance laws and regulations of Illinois and any other applicable states, our investment policy prohibits the following investments and investing activities:

  ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, the average maturity of our fixed maturity investment portfolio was 6.82 years and the average duration was 4.41 years. As a result, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates. In addition, we may experience investment losses to the extent our liquidity needs require the disposition of fixed maturity securities in unfavorable interest rate environments. 
 ﻿
 We use quoted values and other data provided by independent pricing services as inputs in our process for determining fair values of our investments. The pricing services cover substantially all of the securities in our portfolio for which publicly quoted values are not available. The pricing services’ evaluations represent an exit price, a good faith opinion as to what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security in a current sale. The pricing is based on observable inputs either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in markets that are active, quoted prices for similar securities at the measurement date, or other inputs that are observable. 
 ﻿
 Our independent third party investment manager provides us with pricing information that they obtain from independent pricing services, to determine the fair value of our fixed maturity securities. After performing a detailed review of the information obtained from the pricing service, limited adjustments may be made by the manager to the values provided. 
 ﻿
 Our average cash and invested assets, net investment income and return on average cash and invested assets, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

Best is occurring on March 27, 2019 and therefore the report from this evaluation has not yet been released. According to the A.M. Best guidelines, companies rated “B++” are considered by A.M. Best to have “a good ability to meet their ongoing insurance obligations.” The rating evaluates the claims paying ability of a company, and is not a recommendation on the merits of an investment in our common stock. 
 ﻿
 In evaluating a company’s financial and operating performance, A.M. Best reviews:

  ﻿
 In its ratings report on ICC, A.M. Best stated that ICC’s rating reflected ICC’s balance sheet strength, which A.M. Best categorizes as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. A.M. Best also stated that ICC’s capital position has continued to improve under the current management team but additionally has been further enhanced by a capital contribution from ICC following its demutualization which took place in 2017. It was also noted that ICC’s management team continues to push initiatives to improve underwriting results and manage expenses while operating within ICC’s niche that focuses on the food and beverage industry. Although underwriting results are improving, the past five years have fluctuated. A.M. Best has assigned the Parent Company’s outlook to the Issuer Credit Rating as stable. 
 ﻿
 Competition 
 ﻿
 Given our exclusive focus on providing insurance products and services for the food and beverage industry, the market conditions for our business and, accordingly, our competition, varies geographically based upon the states in which we operate and also by the segment of the food and beverage industry (e.g., bars versus fine dining). In the most competitive states in which we operate (Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin), our primary competitors are insurance companies with products targeting the food and beverage industry, such as Society Mutual Insurance Company in all three states, as well as Badger Mutual Insurance Company, Wilson Mutual Insurance Company and West Bend Mutual Insurance Company in Wisconsin. In other jurisdictions, such as Iowa and Minnesota, we compete with the carriers with products identified above (such as Badger Mutual Insurance Company, Wilson Mutual Insurance Company and Founders Insurance Company) and excess and surplus line insurance companies (such as Scottsdale Insurance Company and Lloyd’s of London). In other jurisdictions, like Missouri, our primary competitors are larger regional and national insurance companies without a focus on the food and beverage industry (such as Allied Insurance Company, Auto-Owners Insurance Company and Travelers Insurance Company) and excess and surplus line insurance companies (such as EverGuard Insurance Services, Inc. and Lloyd’s of London). When evaluating the franchise and fine dining segment of the food and beverage industry, we compete with national insurance carriers, such as Allied Insurance Company, Travelers Insurance Company and The Hartford Insurance Company.

 Employees
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 97 full-time equivalent employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
 ﻿
 Regulation 
 ﻿
 General 
 ﻿
 We are subject to extensive regulation, particularly at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state, but generally has its source in statutes and regulations that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to state insurance regulatory agencies. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products, not the companies that write the policies. These laws and regulations have a significant impact on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including accounting methods, agent and company licensure, claims procedures, corporate governance, examinations, investing practices, policy forms, pricing, trade practices, reserve adequacy and underwriting standards. 
 ﻿
 State insurance laws and regulations require ICC to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere it does business, and the operations of ICC and its accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. ICC prepares statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. 
 ﻿
 Premium rate regulation varies greatly among jurisdictions and lines of insurance. In most states in which our subsidiaries write insurance, premium rates for the various lines of insurance are subject to either prior approval or limited review upon implementation. States require rates for property-casualty insurance that are adequate, not excessive, and not unfairly discriminatory. 
 ﻿
 Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable marketplaces in a timely manner. 
 ﻿

     Examinations 
 ﻿

Examinations are conducted by the Illinois Department of Insurance every three to five years. The Illinois Department of Insurance’s last examination of ICC was in November 2017 covering the period from 2012-2016. The report from this exam became available to other states or the public on May 16, 2018. The 2016 examination did not result in any adjustments to our financial position. In addition, there were no substantive qualitative matters indicated in the examination report that had a material adverse impact on our operations.    ﻿
 NAIC Risk-Based Capital Requirements 
 ﻿
 In addition to state-imposed insurance laws and regulations, the NAIC has adopted risk-based capital requirements that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk-based formula. These risk-based capital requirements attempt to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a company’s mix of products and investment portfolio. Under the formula, a company first determines its “authorized control level” risk-based capital. This authorized control level takes into account (i) the risk with respect to the insurer’s assets; (ii) the risk of adverse insurance experience with respect to the insurer’s liabilities and obligations, (iii) the interest rate risk with respect to the insurer’s business; and (iv) all other business risks and such other relevant risks as are set forth in the risk-based capital instructions. A company’s “total adjusted capital” is the sum of statutory capital and surplus and such other items as the risk-based capital instructions may provide. The formula is designed to allow state insurance regulators to identify weakly capitalized companies. 
 ﻿
 The requirements provide for four different levels of regulatory attention. The “company action level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 2.0 times its authorized control level but greater than or equal to 1.5 times its authorized control level. At the company action level, the company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority that discusses proposed corrective actions to improve the capital position. The “regulatory action level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 1.5 times but greater than or equal to 1.0 times its authorized control level. At the regulatory action level, the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed. The “authorized control level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 1.0 times but greater than or equal to 0.7 times its authorized control level; at this level the regulatory authority may take action it deems necessary, including placing the company under regulatory control. The “mandatory control level” is triggered if a company’s total adjusted capital is less than 0.7 times its authorized control level; at this level the regulatory authority is mandated to place the company under its control. The capital levels of ICC have never triggered any of these regulatory capital levels. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the capital requirements applicable to ICC will not increase in the future. 
 ﻿
 NAIC Ratios 
 ﻿
 The NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios. If four or more of its IRIS ratios fall outside the range deemed acceptable by the NAIC, an insurance company may receive inquiries from individual state insurance departments. During each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, ICC did not receive inquiries from regulators on results for any of the IRIS tests.

     Enterprise Risk Assessment 
 ﻿
 In 2012, the NAIC adopted the NAIC Amendments. The NAIC Amendments, when adopted by the various states, are designed to respond to perceived gaps in the regulation of insurance holding company systems in the United States. One of the major changes is a requirement that an insurance holding company system’s ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an “enterprise risk report” that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Other changes include requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of its divestiture of control, having detailed minimum requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates and expanding of the agreements between an insurer and its affiliates to be filed with its domiciliary insurance regulator. In addition, in 2012 the NAIC adopted the Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Model Act. The ORSA Model Act, when adopted by the various states, will require an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit at least annually to its lead state insurance regulator a confidential internal assessment appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of an insurer, conducted by that insurer of the material and relevant risks identified by the insurer associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. Although ICC is exempt from ORSA because of its size, we intend to incorporate those elements of ORSA that we believe constitute “best practices” into its annual internal enterprise risk assessment. 
 ﻿
 Market Conduct Regulation 
 ﻿
 State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. 
 ﻿
 Property and Casualty Regulation 
 ﻿
 Our property and casualty operations are subject to rate and policy form approval, as well as laws and regulations covering a range of trade and claim settlement practices. State insurance regulatory authorities have broad discretion in approving an insurer’s proposed rates. The extent to which a state restricts underwriting and pricing of a line of business may adversely affect an insurer’s ability to operate that business profitably in that state on a consistent basis. 
 ﻿
 State insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability “shared market,” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “FAIR” plans. In addition, some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state. We cannot predict the financial impact of our participation in these arrangements. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 ﻿
 Guaranty Fund Laws 
 ﻿
 All states have guaranty fund laws under which insurers doing business in the state can be assessed to fund policyholder liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Under these laws, an insurer is subject to assessment depending upon its market share in the state of a given line of business. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recovered $38,000 and $11,000, respectively, in assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. We establish reserves relating to insurance companies that are subject to insolvency proceedings when we are notified of assessments by the guaranty associations. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments on ICC under these laws. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

     Federal Regulation 
 ﻿
 The U.S. federal government generally has not directly regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for flood, nuclear and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may impact the insurance industry, including tort reform, corporate governance and the taxation of reinsurance companies. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Federal Insurance Office which is authorized to study, monitor and report to Congress on the insurance industry and to recommend that the Financial Stability Oversight Council designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the U.S. financial stability in the event of the insurer’s material financial distress or failure. In December 2013, the Federal Insurance Office issued a report on alternatives to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. Changes to federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in federal taxation, can also significantly impact the insurance industry and us. 
 ﻿
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 ﻿
 Enacted in 2002, the stated goals of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, are to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We became subject to most of the provisions of the SOX immediately after completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion. 
 ﻿
 The SOX includes very specific disclosure requirements and corporate governance rules and requires the SEC and securities exchanges to adopt extensive additional disclosure, corporate governance and other related regulations. 
 ﻿
 Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 
 ﻿
 In January 2015, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, which amended and extended the Terrorism Insurance Program through December 31, 2020. Under this law, coverage provided by an insurer for losses caused by certified acts of terrorism is partially reimbursed by the United States under a formula under which the government pays 81% of covered terrorism losses exceeding a prescribed deductible. Under the new law, the government’s percentage of compensation for losses will be reduced during each program year by 1% until it equals 80%. The act limits an insurer’s exposure to certified terrorist acts (as defined by the act) to the prescribed deductible amount. The insurance industry’s aggregate deductible (currently $35.5 billion) will increase by $2 billion per calendar year until it equals $37.5 billion. Each insurer’s deductible is capped at 20% of the insurer’s direct earned premium for commercial property and casualty policies. Coverage under the act must be offered to all property, casualty and surety insureds. 
 ﻿
 The new law also amended the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to establish the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers as a nonprofit corporation with the purpose of prescribing licensing and producer qualification requirements and conditions on a multi-state basis. 
 ﻿
 Privacy 
 ﻿
 As mandated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, states continue to promulgate and refine laws and regulations that require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to take steps to protect the privacy of certain consumer and customer information relating to products or services primarily for personal, family or household purposes. A recent NAIC initiative that affected the insurance industry was the adoption in 2000 of the Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Model Regulation, which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. In 2002, to further facilitate the implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the NAIC adopted the Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information Model Regulation. Several states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of customer information. We have implemented procedures to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act’s related privacy requirements. 
 ﻿
 OFAC 
 ﻿
 The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) maintains a list of “Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons” (the SDN List). The SDN List identifies persons and entities that the government believes are associated with terrorists, rogue nations or drug traffickers. OFAC’s regulations prohibit insurers, among others, from doing business with persons or entities on the SDN List. If the insurer finds and confirms a match, the insurer must take steps to block or reject the transaction, notify the affected person and file a report with OFAC.

     JOBS Act 
 ﻿
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, such as reduced public company reporting, accounting and corporate governance requirements. We currently avail ourselves of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 
 ﻿
 Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have taken advantage of the extended transition period provided by Section 107 of the JOBS Act. We decided to comply with the effective dates for financial accounting standards applicable to emerging growth companies at a later date in compliance with the requirements in Sections 107(b)(2) and (3) of the JOBS Act. Such decision is irrevocable.
 ﻿
 We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years following our IPO, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceeds $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. 
 ﻿
 In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. 
 ﻿
 Dividends 
 ﻿
 Illinois law sets the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by ICC during any twelve-month period after notice to, but without prior approval of, the Illinois Department of Insurance. This amount cannot exceed the greater of 10% of the insurance company’s surplus as regards policyholders as reported on the most recent annual statement filed with the Illinois Department of Insurance, or the insurance company’s statutory net income for the period covered by the annual statement as reported on such statement. As of December 31, 2018, the amount available for payment of dividends by ICC in 2019 without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance is approximately $5.1 million. “Extraordinary dividends” in excess of the foregoing limitations may only be paid with prior notice to, and approval of, the Illinois Department of Insurance. See Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources.    ﻿ Holding Company Laws 
 ﻿
 Most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish certain information. This includes information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company group that may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the group. Pursuant to these laws, the Illinois Department of Insurance requires disclosure of material transactions involving ICC and its affiliates, and requires prior notice and/or approval of certain transactions, such as “extraordinary dividends” distributed by ICC. Under these laws, the Illinois Department of Insurance also has the right to examine us at any time. 
 ﻿
 All transactions within our consolidated group affecting ICC must be fair and equitable. Notice of certain material transactions between ICC and any person or entity in our holding company system will be required to be given to the Illinois Department of Insurance. Certain transactions cannot be completed without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance. 
 ﻿
 Approval of the state insurance commissioner is required prior to any transaction affecting the control of an insurer domiciled in that state. In Illinois, the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of an insurer or its holding company is presumed to be a change in control. Illinois law also prohibits any person or entity from (i) making a tender offer for, or a request or invitation for tenders of, or seeking to acquire or acquiring any voting security of a Illinois insurer if, after the acquisition, the person or entity would be in control of the insurer, or (ii) effecting or attempting to effect an acquisition of control of or merger with a Illinois insurer, unless the offer, request, invitation, acquisition, effectuation or attempt has received the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance.
