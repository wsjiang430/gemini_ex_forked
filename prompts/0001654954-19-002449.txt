 ITEM 1.    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
  
  THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS
 
 GrowLife, Inc. (“GrowLife” or the “Company”) is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is headquartered in Kirkland, Washington. We were founded in 2012 with the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT Merger Corporation.
 
  GrowLife’s goal is to become the nation’s largest cultivation facility service provider
   for the production of organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines.
 
 Over the last year we have been discussing how we can meet our goal and help our customers significantly lower their production costs. We have continued to distribute thousands of third-party products to growers through retail, e-commerce and direct sales channels, sold to both commercial and consumer cultivators, and began developing our own products in our Innovations division. As we pursued our goal of “measuring our success by our customer’s success” we discovered that we needed to acquire a critical technology for cloning.
  
 
 As we illustrated in last quarter’s Management Discussion section, the bell curve we mapped out from our ‘Cube’ proof of concept tests showed that the Commercial Cultivation Stage is where most of the money is spent for production. However, the Cloning Stage is where the greatest yield to impact occurs (dashed line). While we could have simply partnered with EZ-Clone, the 20-year leader in cloning, to use their products to help increase the yield of Cube, there were far greater strategic and economic benefits to both companies if GrowLife pursued an acquisition.
 
 On October 15, 2018, GrowLife acquired 51% of EZ-Clone and intends to acquire the remaining 49% in 2019. The addition of EZ-Clone was the missing piece for many reasons. Like a jigsaw puzzle, the pattern became apparent of how we needed to proceed, or pivot the GrowLife business for growth.
 
 The Company will continue to provide the best products that drive down our customer’s production cost while increasing our gross margin. Initially we can purchase and resell third-party products as we have done in the past. However, over time we will develop our own technologies and, in some cases, acquire them to accelerate bringing them to market. Acquiring companies is not difficult but integrating talent and the best of their culture can be challenging. As a result, we have organized to integrate such acquisitions.
  

 At the end of 2018, GrowLife decided to shift its operating organization from divisions to a functional structure with a deep leadership team to provide greater coverage for further geographical and acquisition expansion. Each leader has extensive experience in their roles. With a functional organization we maintain clear lines of daily communication across the company and deep into our operations. A newly acquired company can be quickly integrated into our three groups while maintaining continuity of leadership and knowledge transfer. EZ-Clone integrated into GrowLife in six months, less than half the time of FreeFit. Such best practices are conveyed with Standard Operating Procedures and absorbed with a receptive culture.
 
 Where we once saw divisions to serve different market segments, we elected to align our resources behind three functional groups serving commercial customers at different stages. Where we were racing to the bottom by distributing other people’s commodity products that are perceived as too expensive for our customers and generating only 8-10% gross margins, we now focus on our own GrowLife/EZ-Clone products that generate 40-55% gross margins at reasonable prices to our customers. Additionally, our retail stores in Canada, Los Angeles and Maine serve as regional fulfillment and e-Commerce centers for our commercial customers. And, this is just the start. Given the 87% year-over-year revenue growth, GrowLife will continue to provide essential and hard-to-find goods including growing media, industry-leading hydroponics equipment, organic plant nutrients, and thousands more products on demand to our customers across the United States and Canada. However, as our revenue mix transitions to proprietary products we expect to see our gross margins grow up to approximately 300%.

  Vision
 
  The GrowLife mission is to measure its success by its customer’s success;
   serving cultivators of all sizes as a reliable business partner and its shareholders with value and trust.
 
 Our vision continues to revolve around the key words in our mission statement, “value and trust”, with our employees, our customers and our shareholders. Value is more than economic benefit; it must not mean compromise or that the relationship ends with the transaction; rather, quite the opposite. We have been exploring revenue models that may work the way our commercial customers need help such as dealing with the IRS 280e challenge. Employees and shareholders also expect value but benefits and dilution is challenging so we look to ways that solve problems. For competitive reasons we do not go into details but will disclose as we launch such programs. Thus, we seek value. Trust is earned through consistency of practice. Our operations have demonstrated such practice. We are cautiously transparent where we do not promise what we may not deliver therefore we do not give revenue guidance and, for competitive reasons, avoid too many details, but we share as much as we can to keep our customers and shareholders always informed.
 
 We will continue to provide our customers the over 15,000 products that they demand, however, those third-party manufacturers are not rushing to lower their prices to help our customers lower their production costs. It is understandable because they make more in the short term without concern of the macro-market impact. GrowLife is a nationwide company and is concerned about the macro-economics.
 
 One of the many things that attracted the Company to EZ-Clone was its principal, Billy Blackburn. Billy was working on the EZ-Clone Pro project that the Company saw in 2017. A cloning system for almost 500 clones at one time; a system that could easily cannibalize his smaller core cloning business. We discussed the trade-offs and he told me “that’s where the market is going and what customer’s need. EZ-Clone needs to adjust, not our customers.” I am so glad that he is on our team and heading up R&D and manufacturing.
 
 We see outdoor farming as a wasteful, destructive and an inefficient use of precious resources. Current water, land and harvest cycles are limited and, if left unchecked, will fail to support the world’s population growth. However, indoor cultivation allows our customers to replicate nature in a controllable manner that uses a fraction of water and land while providing 2–5 times the crop cycles of outdoor. The challenge is in getting the economics right. Subsidies are not the answer. Even many large-scale indoor grow operations with large capital investments have had a difficult time staying in business because the poor economic models fail to deliver a profit. Fruits and vegetables have limited revenue benefit due to their low prices and saturated supply from international and domestic growers.
 
 Cannabis on the other hand currently has an attractive revenue model and valuation multiple but modest demand of about 5% of the population due to shadows cast by interstate commerce restrictions, banking issues and threatening federal laws. However, Cannabis laws are not the only expected changes. We must prepare for significantly lower prices if Cannabis is to become a mainstream alternative to beer, wine and other alcohol in the future. Expecting a $12 Cannabis cigarette to drop to $1 over the next couple of years is not unreasonable.
 
 Therefore, GrowLife’s vision of indoor cultivation is that it is inevitable, not another gardening alternative. For the Cannabis market, as well as all indoor cultivators of fruits and vegetables, to serve their markets and customers they must significantly increase operations at scale, remove inefficiencies and lower their production costs with local, safer, healthier and affordable crops. We see lowering the cost of production as the game changer. This means increasing efficiencies, scaling up production volumes and driving down indoor operating costs. Given this vision of the future, lowering our customer’s production costs serves as our compass to mergers, acquisitions and partnerships.

 GrowLife’s commercial customers are at different stages of commercial operations across all States and Provenances.  Along with our business-to-business focus we have looked at the business-to-consumer sought to offer the GrowLife Consumer Cube products. We recognize demand is increasing from small, aspiring cultivation consumers across the country seeking to learn and use a complete indoor growing solution.  At this time, however, we recognize that we cannot serve both the consumer and commercial markets so we have decided to concentrate our efforts on commercial customers.
 
 To grow our commercial programs GrowLife is investing in two areas, Sales with Marketing support and Research and Development or innovation. The funding for these efforts started with $1 million in equity financing in February 2018 from Chicago Venture Partners and then with $2.5 million from our shareholders in our Rights Offering. These funds allowed us to begin our expansion and innovation projects, thus our greater than normal G&A expenses and EZ-Clone acquisition.

  -
Consumer interest in organic foods and hydroponic growing has also increased as disposable income continues to rise.

  -
Given the discretionary nature of the industry’s products, demand is heavily influenced by fluctuations in the overall level of consumer disposable income and consumer confidence in the economy. Over the five years to 2017, per capita disposable income is anticipated to grow an annualized 1.4%. Rising disposable income increases consumers’ willingness to purchase luxuries such as high-priced hydroponic growing equipment and organic foods.

  -
Impact of the Cannabis Industry

  o
According to data released by Forbes, the medical marijuana market is expected to generate $6.7 billion in 2017 alone. Given the size of the medical marijuana market, a rising number of entrepreneurs have invested in hydroponic growing equipment to be part of the medical marijuana gold rush. This investment has been one of the primary drivers of the aggressive growth that this industry has experienced over the past five years.

  o
In certain states, patients with medical marijuana cards are also allowed to grow limited quantities of marijuana for personal use. This has encouraged patients to purchase hydroponic growing equipment and pursue small-scale marijuana cultivation.

 
 Competitive advantages:
 
  -
Most hydroponic growing equipment stores are small business operations that serve their immediate geographic areas. GrowLife serves a nationwide audience with expansion into Canada.

 
 Growth Outlook:

 Medical and Recreational Marijuana Growing Industry
 
 Industry Definition:
 
 This emerging industry pertains to those engaged in the practice of cultivating and producing legal marijuana plants for the medical and recreational consumer markets.
 
 US 2016 Key Industry Statistics:
 
  -
In 2016, the Medical and Recreational Marijuana Growing industry generated $3.5 billion in gross revenue with total profits of $233.4 million.

  -
The industry grew 28.3% from 2011 to 2016 and is expected to continuing growing at a rate of 33.5% through 2021.

  -
As of 2016, there are approximately 148,294 businesses engaged in the industry, which contribute $957.6 million in wages and salaries to the nation’s economy.

  -
No companies have been identified as “major players”.

  -
Medical Marijuana patients with severe pain comprise the largest market segment for the industry, accounting for 64.6% of the market in 2016, with recreational consumers accounting for 14.1% of the market. The remaining market share is shared by consumers purchasing products for treatment of other various medical conditions.

  -
The industry’s average profit margin, defined as earnings before interest and taxes, varies greatly across the industry because of the myriad of laws governing medical and recreational marijuana from state to state. Industry-wide margins have grown on account of the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington and are expected to grow as more legalization takes effect including California.

 

 Key Industry Drivers:
 
  -
Medical marijuana growers continue to benefit from the steadily aging population. Chronic illnesses have become more prevalent as the population continues to age, driving demand for medical marijuana.

  -
An estimated 2.6 million people use marijuana for medicinal purposes, and this segment of the US population is anticipated to increase drastically over the next five years.

  -
More than two-thirds of Americans now live in jurisdictions that have legalized either the medical or adult use of marijuana.

 
 Growth Outlook:
 
 “The industry is growing at a faster rate than the US economy”
 
  -
Industry revenue is estimated to increase at an annualized rate of 33.5% to $15.0 billion over the five years to 2021.

 Factors:
 
  -
Continued legalization on the state level will increase accessibility to medical and recreational marijuana, increasing nationwide demand.

  -
Growing acceptance of the marijuana products will increase demand. According to a poll conducted by Gallup, 36.0% of Americans between the ages of 18 to 29 have tried marijuana in 2013, compared with just 8.0% in 1969.

  -
The level of household income determines consumers’ ability to purchase medical marijuana products. While prescription products can be essential for health and therefore less susceptible to changes in consumer expenditure, the unconventional nature of the industry’s products make it subject to changes in disposable income. As a result, an increase in disposable income will boost demand for medical marijuana growers.

  On October 3, 2017, we closed the acquisition of 51% of the Purchased Assets from David Reichwein, a Pennsylvania resident, GIP International Ltd, a Hong Kong corporation and DPR International LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability corporation. The Purchased Assets include intellectual property, copy rights and trademarks related to reflective tiles and flooring.
  
 On February 16, 2018, we entered into an Addendum (the “First Addendum”) to amend the terms between the Company and David Reichwein. Pursuant to the First Addendum, we purchased the remaining 49% of the Purchased Assets in exchange for a one-time payment of $250,000 and the cancellation of Mr. Reichwein’s right to receive a 10% commission on certain sales of Free Fit products as was set forth in Mr. Reichwein’s employment agreement. In exchange for the cancellation of the commission in the employment agreement, Mr. Reichwein was granted the opportunity to earn up to two $100,000 cash bonuses and an aggregate common stock bonus of up to 7,500,000 shares if certain revenue and gross margin goals are met in 2018.
  
 On August 17, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Go Green Hydroponics, Inc., a California corporation and TCA – Go Green SPV, LLC, a Florida limited liability pursuant to which the Company acquired the intellectual property and assumed the lease for the property located at 15721 Ventura Blvd., Encino, CA 91436.

  Government Regulation
 
 Currently, there are thirty three states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. There are currently ten states and the District of Columbia that allow recreational use of cannabis. As of March 8, 2019, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of customers of GrowLife to invest in or buy products from GrowLife. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the GrowLife companies.
 
 All this being said, many reports show that the majority of the American public is in favor of making medical cannabis available as a controlled substance to those patients who need it. The need and consumption will then require cultivators to continue to provide safe and compliant crops to consumers. The cultivators will then need to build facilities and use consumable products, which GrowLife provides.

  -
An estimated 2.6 million people use marijuana for medicinal purposes, and this segment of the US population is anticipated to increase drastically over the next five years.

  -
More than two-thirds of Americans now live in jurisdictions that have legalized either the medical or adult use of marijuana.

  -
The industry has been significantly restricted by an increasing amount of proposed regulations. In particular, medical marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, despite state-level legalization. Following legalization in many states during the 2016 election cycle, and expected legalization in the upcoming 2018 cycle, beneficial regulation is expected to create an opportunity for the industry.

Factors:
 
  -
Continued legalization on the state level will increase accessibility to medical and recreational marijuana, increasing nationwide demand.

  -
Growing acceptance of the marijuana products will increase demand. According to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, 62% of Americans say the use of marijuana should be legalized in 2018, compared with just 31% in 2000.

  -
The level of household income determines consumers’ ability to purchase medical marijuana products. While prescription products can be essential for health and therefore less susceptible to changes in consumer expenditure, the unconventional nature of the industry’s products make it subject to changes in disposable income. As a result, an increase in disposable income will boost demand for medical marijuana growers.
