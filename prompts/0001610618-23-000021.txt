Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of long-acting therapeutics designed to transform the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases. We are focused on infectious diseases and oncology. Our lead product candidate is rezafungin (trade name REZZAYOTM), an intravenous formulation of a novel echinocandin antifungal. Rezafungin is being developed as a once-weekly, high-exposure therapy for the treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections. Rezafungin will be positioned in the estimated $4.2 billion global systemic antifungal market in which there is high unmet need, high mortality rate, few new agents in development and significant market opportunity.
Our primary focus now is using our Cloudbreak® platform to develop a potential new class of drugs called drug-Fc conjugates, or DFCs, for the prevention and treatment of serious diseases. This technology couples potent inhibitors to a human antibody fragment to create long-acting DFCs designed to inhibit multiple disease targets. Our most advanced DFC program is CD388, a highly potent, long-acting antiviral designed to deliver universal prevention and treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza, which is in Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical trials. Additional programs are targeting the SARS-CoV-2 strains causing COVID-19 and multiple solid tumor oncology indications.
Recent Developments
Cloudbreak Oncology Program
Immune checkpoint antagonists have generated durable responses in cancers with improved side effect profiles compared to conventional chemotherapy. However, to date, improved outcomes from existing therapies have been limited to a relatively small subset of patients. To broaden the response rate to more patients, targeting additional mechanisms of tumor immune evasion will be critical. Using our DFC approach, we are seeking to generate a best-in-class CD73 inhibitor that combines the attributes of small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibody, or mAb, inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials.
In January 2023, we nominated CBO-212 as our first oncology DFC candidate. With our Cloudbreak oncology program we seek to develop a new generation of immunotherapies, and our lead oncology DFC candidate, CD421 (which is an enhanced version of CBO-212), is a first-in-class CD73 inhibitor that combines the strengths of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies targeting CD73. We are currently advancing CD421 that confers reduced immunogenic properties through investigational new drug application, or IND, -enabling studies.
In February 2023, we expanded our existing collaboration with WuXi XDC, a leading global contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, dedicated to end-to-end bioconjugates services, under which WuXi XDC will provide IND-enabling chemistry and manufacturing and controls, or CMC, development services for our Cloudbreak oncology program.
FDA Advisory Committee Recommendation and FDA Approval of Rezafungin for the Treatment of Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis
On January 24, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee voted favorably 14 to 1 that we, as part of our New Drug Application, or NDA, provided sufficient evidence supporting a favorable benefit-risk assessment for a limited use indication for rezafungin for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options.
On March 22, 2023, the FDA approved REZZAYO (rezafungin for injection) for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults with limited or no alternative treatment options. REZZAYO is the first new treatment option approved for patients with candidemia and invasive candidiasis in over a decade, and is the only available once-weekly echinocandin.
Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements
On February 9, 2023, we received formal notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC, or Nasdaq, Hearings Panel, or the Panel, stating that we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), subject to a discretionary Panel Monitor until November 9, 2023.

Phase 2a Interim Results
On March 1, 2023, we announced efficacy and safety data from a planned interim analysis of our ongoing Phase 2a trial evaluating the pre-exposure prophylactic activity of CD388 against the H3N2 influenza A virus strain, as of a February 13, 2023 data cut-off. The Phase 2a trial is a single-center, randomized, double-blind influenza challenge study in healthy volunteers designed to assess the prophylactic antiviral activity, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CD388 in healthy volunteers. The interim analysis is based on 56 subjects enrolled in the trial, with 28 subjects receiving a single dose of CD388 (150 mg) and 28 subjects receiving a placebo.
The interim data for the primary efficacy endpoint of Area Under the Viral Load-Time Curve (a measure of a drug’s ability to attenuate viral replication), or VL-AUC, and for the secondary efficacy endpoint of influenza infection incidence for 150 mg CD388 versus placebo are shown below.

 | Placebo (n=28) | CD388 150 mg (n=28)
Area Under the Viral Load-time Curve (VL-AUC)- Mean (SD) | 16.1 (11.9) | 10.7 (8.0) 
PCR confirmed influenza infection- n (%) | 14 (50%) | 6 (21.4%) 

As shown above, despite the small sample size in this planned interim analysis, a decrease in viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and influenza infection was observed in participants receiving a single dose of CD388 when compared to placebo. No treatment emergent adverse events leading to study discontinuation or serious adverse events were reported in the interim analysis. All participants included in the interim analysis received either CD388 or placebo and were then challenged with influenza five days later.
Cloudbreak Platform
We believe our Cloudbreak platform has the potential to offer a fundamentally new approach to prevent and treat serious diseases, by developing product candidates designed to provide potent disease targeting activity and immune system engagement in a single long-acting molecule. Because serious disease often results when a pathogen or cancer cell evades or overcomes the host immune system, our Cloudbreak DFC candidates are designed to counter diseases in two ways: prevention of disease proliferation or immune evasion by directly targeting and, where applicable, by focusing the immune system on a pathogen or infected cell. We believe this is a potentially transformative approach, distinct from current therapies, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. In addition, DFCs are designed to have several advantages, including:
•Multivalent binding which has the potential to increase potency;
•Ability to engage different targets on the same target cell to decrease resistance or, in the case of a cancerous cell, to serve as a “drug cocktail” in a single molecule, which may improve response to treatment;
•Potential to target multiple viral pathogens or oncological targets with a single DFC; and
•Potential for universal coverage against all viral variants and all people irrespective of immune status.
In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, our DFCs are smaller, have the potential for better tissue penetration and are designed to target multiple sites. Unlike small molecules, we believe DFC optimization can be focused primarily on potency.
Our lead Cloudbreak candidates are CD388, a DFC for the prevention and treatment of influenza, or influenza DFC, and CD421, a CD73-targeting DFC for the treatment of solid tumors.
In September 2020, we nominated CD388, our influenza DFC, as a development candidate. We submitted an IND for CD388 in December 2021 and initiated a Phase 1 trial (NCT05285137) in March 2022. The Phase 1 trial is a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of intramuscular and subcutaneous administration of CD388 in healthy subjects. Dosing of all six planned cohorts has been initiated as planned. In addition, a separate Phase 1 Japanese bridging study has been initiated.
In September 2022, we initiated a Phase 2a trial (NCT05523089) to evaluate the pre-exposure prophylactic activity of CD388 against influenza virus. The Phase 2a trial, which dosed its first healthy volunteer in September 2022, is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study to assess the prophylactic antiviral activity, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CD388 against influenza via a human viral challenge (influenza) model. Multiple dose levels of CD388 will be evaluated in volunteers who will receive a single administration of CD388 or placebo prior to influenza viral challenge. Interim results in February 2023 demonstrated a reduction in the viral load (area under the curve) for 150 mg of CD388 compared to placebo and a reduction in the incidence of subjects infected following influenza challenge for 150 mg of CD388 compared to placebo. Final results are expected later in 2023.
All Phase 1 and Phase 2a trials are being conducted under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement (as defined below).
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

In December 2022, we received the first U.S. patent for CD388. The patent includes claims directed to the composition of matter of CD388. The patent is projected to expire in 2039 plus any available patent term extension.
The Cloudbreak platform has also enabled us to expand the development of DFCs to target other life-threatening viral diseases including the SARS-CoV-2 strains causing COVID-19.
In addition, we have expanded the Cloudbreak platform beyond infectious diseases, to discover and develop highly potent DFCs that can target multiple immune checkpoint pathways with a single DFC for oncologic diseases. Cidara’s lead oncology development candidate, CD421, targets CD73 in the adenosine pathway, which contributes to immune evasion in solid cancers by flooding the tumor microenvironment with adenosine, a potent immune cell suppressor. CD73 is highly expressed on a variety of tumor and stromal cells as well as immunosuppressive cell populations, such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. CD421 is designed to address the potency, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety limitations of small molecule and monoclonal antibody candidates targeting CD73.
Janssen Collaboration Agreement
On March 31, 2021, we entered into the exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement, or the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen, one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to develop and commercialize one or more DFCs based on our Cloudbreak platform for the prevention and treatment of influenza.
Under the terms of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, we are collaborating in the research, preclinical and early clinical development of CD388, under a mutually-agreed research plan with the objective of advancing development through Phase 1 clinical trials and the first Phase 2a clinical trial. We are responsible for performing all IND-enabling nonclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials under the research plan. Both parties are responsible for conducting certain specified chemistry, manufacturing and controls development activities under the research plan. Janssen is solely responsible, and reimburses us for internal personnel and out-of-pocket costs incurred in performing the research plan activities in accordance with an agreed budget. After completion of the research plan and upon its election to proceed with development, Janssen will be solely responsible for late-stage development, manufacturing, licensure and commercialization. Upon the effectiveness of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, Janssen paid us an upfront payment of $27.0 million. As of the execution of the Janssen Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible for reimbursement by Janssen of up to $58.2 million in research and development costs incurred in conducting research plan activities. As of December 31, 2022, we have received the $27.0 million up-front payment, $25.1 million in research and development reimbursements, and $3.0 million in milestone payments.
We are eligible to receive up to an additional $237.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments from Janssen for successful completion of certain activities over the next several years, including but not limited to Janssen’s decision to proceed with clinical development and initiation of a pivotal trial. In addition, we may be eligible to receive approximately $455.0 million in commercial milestones as well as royalties on tiers of annual net sales at rates from the mid-single digits to the high-single digits.
Rezafungin
Rezafungin is a novel molecule in the echinocandin class of antifungals. We are developing rezafungin for the treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections which are associated with high mortality rates.
ReSTORE Phase 3 clinical trial
In December 2021, we reported positive topline results from ReSTORE, our Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in patients with candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis (NCT03667690). ReSTORE was a global, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of rezafungin as a potential first-line treatment for candidemia and invasive candidiasis. ReSTORE enrolled 187 patients and evaluated one 400 milligram, or mg, loading dose of rezafungin for the first week followed by 200 mg of rezafungin dosed once-weekly for up to four weeks in total. The treatment arm was compared to approved daily dosing of caspofungin in a 1:1 randomization.
Results from the ReSTORE trial showed that rezafungin met the primary endpoint for the FDA of all-cause mortality at Day 30, and also met the primary endpoint for the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, of global cure at Day 14. Both results demonstrated statistical non-inferiority of rezafungin dosed once-weekly, versus caspofungin dosed once-daily, the current standard of care.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

ReSPECT Phase 3 clinical trial
We are currently conducting the ReSPECT, single, global, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial (NCT04368559) in patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant to assess rezafungin in a 90-day prophylaxis regimen to prevent infections due to Candida, Aspergillus and Pneumocystis. Rezafungin, dosed at 400 mg for the first week followed by 200 mg once weekly out to 90 days, is being compared to a regimen containing two drugs (an azole and Bactrim) dosed once daily for 90 days. The primary efficacy outcome for this trial for the FDA and EMA is fungal-free survival at Day 90. We expect this trial to enroll approximately 462 patients, and over 50% of patients have been enrolled thus far. While the ReSPECT trial remains open for enrollment, we continue to monitor the near- and long-term impact of COVID-19 on the ability of our clinical investigators to recruit patients at each of our global clinical trial sites. The study is currently enrolling in the European Union, or EU, Canada and the U.S.
Melinta License Agreement
On July 26, 2022, we entered into a License Agreement, or the Melinta License Agreement, with Melinta Therapeutics, LLC, or Melinta, under which we granted Melinta an exclusive license to develop and commercialize products that contain or incorporate rezafungin in the U.S.
Melinta will be solely responsible for the commercialization of rezafungin in the U.S., at its sole expense. We are responsible for conducting an agreed upon development plan that includes, among other activities, completion of the ongoing ReSPECT Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in adult allogeneic blood and marrow transplant recipients. We will initially remain the holder of the rezafungin IND and NDA. Both applications will transfer to Melinta on a transfer date determined based on the status of the ReSPECT trial and the associated supplemental NDA for the prophylaxis indication. Following the transfer date, we will remain financially responsible for post-marketing commitments and other remaining development obligations and the costs for those will be deducted from royalties owed to us by Melinta.
The total potential transaction value of the Melinta License Agreement is $460.0 million, including a $30.0 million upfront payment and up to $430.0 million in regulatory and commercial milestones. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on U.S. sales in the low double digits to mid-teens. As of December 31, 2022, we have received the $30.0 million up-front payment.
Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement
On September 3, 2019, we announced a strategic partnership with Mundipharma to develop and commercialize rezafungin in an intravenous formulation for the treatment and prevention of invasive fungal infections. Under the terms of the Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Mundipharma Collaboration Agreement, with Mundipharma Medical Company, or Mundipharma, we granted Mundipharma an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, register and commercialize rezafungin outside the U.S. and Japan. The total potential transaction value is $568.4 million, including an equity investment, an up-front payment, global development funding, and certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. The Company is also eligible to receive double-digit royalties in the teens on tiers of annual net sales.
As of December 31, 2022, we have received $9.0 million from the sale of our equity to Mundipharma, a $30.0 million up-front payment, $31.2 million in global development funding, and $25.1 million in milestone payments (including an $11.1 million milestone payment creditable against future royalties payable to us).
Our Strategy
Our objective is to become the leading biotechnology company in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel, best-in-class long-acting therapeutics designed to transform the standard of care for patients facing serious diseases. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Develop product candidates from our Cloudbreak platform. In December 2021, we submitted an IND for CD388 for seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention and treatment, which is in Phase 1 and Phase 2a clinical trials, and are developing new product candidates targeting the prevention and treatment of other life-threatening viral diseases including the SARS-CoV-2 strains causing COVID-19. In addition, we have expanded the Cloudbreak platform beyond infectious diseases, to discover and develop highly potent DFCs that can target multiple immune checkpoint pathways with a single DFC for oncologic diseases. Our lead oncology development candidate, CD421, targets CD73 in the adenosine pathway. We have recently expanded our existing collaboration with WuXi XDC under which WuXi XDC will provide IND-enabling CMC development services for our Cloudbreak oncology program. We may fund these programs alone, with grant or government contract funding or through new partnerships we may consider. We will also continue to establish intellectual property related to the Cloudbreak platform, its applications and development candidates.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

•Advance rezafungin to approval. We are developing rezafungin, a once-weekly echinocandin antifungal, to address serious fungal infections, including, but not limited to those considered urgent and serious threats by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. We successfully completed our ReSTORE Phase 3 treatment clinical trial, which served as the basis for our NDA filing for the treatment indication, and are currently enrolling our ReSPECT Phase 3 prophylaxis clinical trial. Approval in these indications would enable our licensing partners to target two distinct and commercially-attractive market segments with significant unmet needs from the current standard of care: the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, and the prevention of invasive fungal infections in a highly vulnerable population, adults undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation.
Rezafungin
We acquired rezafungin, a novel echinocandin antifungal agent, in 2014. We believe rezafungin has the potential to be differentiated from other echinocandins and other classes of antifungal agents based on its once-weekly dosing, high front -loaded exposure, high tissue penetration, safety and tolerability profile, lack of drug-drug interactions and broad spectrum.
Rezafungin is being developed for both the treatment and prevention of serious, invasive fungal infections.
Overview of Systemic Fungal Infections and the Antifungal Market
Fungal infections pose significant medical challenges in both the hospital and outpatient settings. While fungi are ubiquitous in our environment, they are usually harmless for people with a normal immune system. If fungi access and proliferate in the bloodstream, these infections become systemic and potentially life-threatening. Risk factors for systemic fungal infections include recent gastrointestinal surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotic use, central vascular catheter placement, use of total parenteral nutrition, renal failure, solid organ transplantation, blood and marrow transplantation or BMT, chemotherapy and other forms of immune suppression.
We estimate that the annual worldwide sales of prescription systemic antifungals in 2017 were approximately $4.2 billion. This includes therapies used as prophylaxis (preventive) in the inpatient and outpatient setting, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, or those undergoing BMT, therapies used for the treatment of hospitalized patients, and therapies used for the treatment of patients who are being discharged from the hospital.
The majority of invasive fungal infections are caused by two fungi, Candida and Aspergillus. We estimate that approximately 97,000 Americans may die from invasive fungal infections each year. Approximately 90 percent of all reported fungal related deaths result from a few common fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus and Pneumocystis. Systemic Candida infections include candidemia and invasive candidiasis. In a 2014 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, candidemia was shown to be the most common cause of healthcare-acquired bloodstream infections in the U.S.
Despite advances achieved in the diagnosis and treatment of candidemia, these infections continue to cause high mortality rates. According to a study published in Clinical Infectious Disease (2009), candidemia has a crude mortality rate of 35% within 12 weeks of diagnosis. By contrast, the CDC reports that the mortality rate due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, infections is 13%. Further, it is estimated that each case of candidemia results in an additional 23 days of hospitalization and over $68,000 in additional treatment costs.
Physicians’ options for the treatment of systemic fungal infections are limited by a lack of innovative therapies. Several factors have contributed to the low rate of antifungal drug development, including a limited number of fungal-specific drug targets for research and a previously challenging regulatory environment that necessitated large and costly clinical trials. As a result, the number of antifungals has decreased to only one new approval since 2006, while anti-microbial resistance has increased.
The current treatment alternatives for systemic fungal infections, including polyenes, azoles and currently-approved echinocandins, have limitations that we believe may be addressed by novel antifungals. While these drugs have proven to be efficacious in many patients, mortality rates remain high, and the polyenes and azoles may cause severe side effects warranting discontinuation and are known to cause significant changes in a drug’s effect on the body when taken together with a second drug, or drug-drug interactions, or DDIs. Patients who have received a BMT, cancer chemotherapy or solid organ transplant may receive antifungal prophylaxis to prevent deadly Candida, Aspergillus and/or Pneumocystis infections for several weeks to over a year, depending on the period of immunosuppression or development of Graft Versus Host Disease. Current paradigms for the prevention of invasive fungal disease are complex because they require patient-specific plans and drug cocktails, dictated by the underlying disease and the local epidemiology of fungal infections which may be subject to change even when customized.
In the hematology setting, patients are at increased risk for serious DDIs given many newly approved therapies used to treat blood cancers have contraindications or precautions when taken with azole antifungals, the current standard of care

for antifungal prophylaxis. For prevention of pneumocystis pneumonia trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or TMP/SMX, known as Bactrim, is the agent of choice for first-line prophylaxis. Challenges with TMP/SMX include bone marrow suppression, allergies, and nephrotoxicity.
Current prophylaxis requires multiple drugs for coverage of common pathogens. The complex nature of the immunocompromised patient and the complexity of the current antifungal drugs used today for prophylaxis (azoles and TMP/SMX), create significant opportunity for improvement.
Echinocandins, introduced in 2001, are increasingly recommended for the treatment of fungal infections in the U.S. In December 2015, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or the IDSA, released new clinical guidelines that recognize that echinocandins have demonstrated statistical superiority to azoles for the initial treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, and now recommend echinocandins as first-line treatment for this indication.
The currently approved echinocandins include caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin, and are considered both well tolerated and safe relative to other antifungal drug classes. However, they must be administered daily by intravenous infusion, potentially extending the hospitalization of patients for the duration of therapy and limiting their use mainly to the hospital setting. Despite this limitation, roughly ten percent of patients on echinocandins receive once-daily infusions at home or need to travel to an outpatient infusion center daily, for weeks if not months. This use is reflective of an increased need for broad spectrum Candida coverage, increasing azole resistance and complications due to the complexity of patients, and a financial incentive to discharge patients earlier to reduce hospital costs.
The CDC reports that certain species of Candida are becoming increasingly resistant to available antifungals, such as azoles and approved echinocandins. Widespread usage of antifungals in the azole class, in particular, has stimulated an increase in resistance. Non-albicans Candida, which have a higher rate of azole resistance, now cause approximately two-thirds of candidemia cases in the U.S. In 2019, the CDC issued its Report on Antibiotic Resistant Threats. The list included several fungal pathogens: Candida auris is listed as an ‘Urgent Threat’, Drug-resistant Candida is listed as a ‘Serious Threat’ and Azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus as a ‘Watch List Threat’.
In order to be effective, an echinocandin drug should be present early in therapy at an exposure that is as high as is safely possible. The key pharmacokinetic parameters affecting exposure include the drug’s half-life, maximum plasma concentration, or Cmax, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve, or AUC. The maximum dose that can be used is based on the drug’s overall safety profile. With echinocandin drugs, high drug exposures early in therapy, as measured by Cmax or AUC, maximize the antifungal therapeutic benefit of these drugs.
When a fungus starts to develop resistance to a drug, the minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, rises, which means that a higher drug exposure will be required in order for the drug to have the same efficacy as it has against sensitive strains. Having a C max and an AUC that are far greater than the starting MIC provides the best chance of treating infections caused by strains resistant to other antifungals, including other echinocandins. Additionally, the EU label for caspofungin requires higher doses in obese patients. A recent analysis found that micafungin, the market leader in the U.S., achieves 85% - 88% target attainment (against C. glabrata MIC97 of 0.06 mg/L) when given at the higher dosing regimen of 200 mg followed by 150 mg, daily but achieves only 10% - 50% with its approved dose of 100 mg once daily. These factors suggest the pharmacokinetic of the currently approved echinocandins are not optimal.
Despite the widespread continued use of each class of antifungals, we believe that market opportunities exist for novel therapeutics which combine the spectrum and safety of the echinocandins, while improving pharmacokinetic characteristics to enable enhanced efficacy, simplicity, outpatient use and pharmacokinetic.
Our Solution—Rezafungin for the Treatment and Prevention of Serious Fungal Infections
Due to its novel chemical structure, rezafungin has a prolonged half-life, a high Cmax and a high AUC. In addition, rezafungin was tested in vitro against 27 echinocandin-non-susceptible Candida isolates and demonstrated equivalent or greater potency against these strains compared to caspofungin, with up to eight-fold greater potency for several isolates. Rezafungin was also tested in vitro against 100 isolates of Candida auris, a highly resistant emerging strain, including eight isolates that were resistant to other echinocandins, and showed equivalent or better potency (up to 64-fold) than the currently available echinocandins against the echinocandin-resistant strains.
These factors are in contrast to all other echinocandins, and we believe they can allow rezafungin to be developed as a once-weekly intravenous therapy for the treatment and prevention of systemic fungal infections. We are developing rezafungin to overcome the limitations of the echinocandin class and other antifungals by offering the following key benefits.
•Potential to treat resistant pathogens. We believe that rezafungin can be used to treat fungal infections caused by drug-resistant fungi, including those currently resistant to echinocandins, due to its potency against resistant strains and its higher drug exposure early in the course of therapy. We expect that this higher exposure early in the course of disease may improve clearance infections caused by both resistant as well as non-resistant pathogens.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

•Single-agent treatment. Rather than treating patients with an echinocandin followed by an oral azole solely to enable earlier hospital discharge, rezafungin would enable extended single-agent intravenous echinocandin treatment for the full course of therapy, thereby enabling treatment that is consistent with current guidance in the U.S. and the EU.
•Shorter and less costly hospital stays, and lower outpatient costs. Physicians with access to a once-weekly intravenous echinocandin can potentially discharge appropriate patients earlier and thereby reduce hospital costs, which we believe may account for over 80% of the overall treatment cost of candidemia. Furthermore, early discharge from the hospital and/or ICU setting may reduce the risk for contracting nosocomial infections. Data from the Phase 3 ReSTORE trial suggest a numerically shorter length of stay for patients in the rezafungin arm vs patients in the caspofungin arm, in both the ICU and hospital. For patients discharged on an intravenous echinocandin, once-weekly rezafungin could eliminate significant outpatient infusion costs for once-daily intravenous echinocandin therapy.
•Improved compliance. A once-weekly treatment of rezafungin could facilitate compliance by eliminating the need for patients to return to a hospital or outpatient center for a daily dose of an intravenous echinocandin, and could eliminate the likelihood of patient non-compliance for those receiving oral step-down therapy with a daily azole.
•Enabling or improving prophylaxis regimens. Some patients cannot receive azole or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylactic therapy due to drug interactions or poor tolerability. We expect that once weekly rezafungin therapy could provide for better prophylactic therapy on an inpatient and outpatient basis, particularly for these patients.
We have sought multiple designations from regulators, including the FDA and the EMA, to support the rapid evaluation of rezafungin in the development phase and to enhance the commercial attributes of rezafungin in the commercial phase. 
In the U.S., the FDA has granted rezafungin the following designations:
•For the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, rezafungin has designations for Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, Fast Track, and Orphan Drug. QIDP and Orphan Drug designations together provide a total of 12 years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. from the time of FDA approval.
•For the prophylactic use in patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant, rezafungin has designations for QIDP and Fast Track. The QIDP designation provides a total of five years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. from the time of FDA approval.
The FDA’s QIDP and Fast Track designations are designed to provide eligibility for (1) more frequent interactions with the FDA to expedite drug development and review, (2) priority review, which seeks to reduce the total time for FDA to take action on a NDA from 12 months to eight months, and (3) QIDP provides a five-year extension to any marketing exclusivity period for which the drug qualifies on approval. The FDA’s Orphan Drug designation is designed to provide eligibility for (1) a seven-year period of market exclusivity in the U.S. upon FDA approval, (2) financial benefits including a waiver from payment of user fees and tax credits for the cost of the clinical research, and (3) an exemption from performing clinical trials in pediatric patients.
In the EU, the European Commission has granted rezafungin Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. The Orphan Drug Designation provides (1) unlimited scientific advice on the trials needed to assess benefit risk, (2) reduced fees, (3) 10 years of market exclusivity protection from similar medicines with similar indications upon approval of the marketing authorization, and (4) two additional years of market exclusivity when the results from pediatric studies compliant with an approved Pediatric Investigational Plan, or PIP, are included in the Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC.
We, together with our partners Mundipharma and Melinta, plan to seek orphan drug designation for rezafungin for prophylactic use in the U.S. and Europe.

In addition, we have expanded the Cloudbreak platform beyond infectious diseases to discover and develop highly potent DFCs that can target multiple immune checkpoint pathways with a single DFC for oncologic diseases.
Cloudbreak candidates targeting viral infections are called DFCs, single molecules consisting of two distinct moieties with discrete, yet complementary mechanisms of action:
•Targeting Moiety (TM): A highly potent small molecule and/or peptide that binds surface targets on the pathogen or host cell to directly inhibit viral proliferation.
•Effector Moiety (EM): A proprietary composition that contains the fragment crystallizable, or Fc, region of human IgG1 antibodies, which was selected to extend half-life engagement and engage the human immune system via Fc-gamma receptors.
DFCs not only mediate pathogen clearance through a multimodal mechanism of action but also have potential for months of activity with a single dose.
Cloudbreak DFC (drug-Fc conjugate) Program Overview
Cidara is leveraging the Cloudbreak platform to address multiple diseases. Each DFC targets a life-threatening disease, focused on infectious diseases and oncology. Our DFC research and development programs include:
•Influenza;
•Cancer (solid tumors); and
•COVID-19.
DFCs provide direct, sustained antiviral activity as well as immune system engagement, for effective prevention and treatment of disease. This is a potentially transformative approach, distinct from current approaches. DFCs are not vaccines, small-molecule drugs, or monoclonal antibodies. DFCs are novel, Fc-conjugates designed for the following features:
•Multimodal mechanism of action: Potent, direct antiviral activity and tunable immune system engagement
•Strong target binding: High affinity to essential, conserved targets on the virus surface and/or surface of infected cells
•Long duration of action: Months of protection from disease with a single dose
•Rapid onset: Rapid distribution to site of infection for treatment of disease

Cloudbreak Influenza Program and Our DFC Development Candidate CD388
Influenza is a respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses. The influenza virus can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Young children, adults older than 65 years, pregnant women and immunocompromised patients are more prone to infection, but even healthy people are at risk of infection with seasonal influenza. The primary preventive measure to protect against influenza is the seasonal vaccine, which remains the best mode to prevent influenza related illness, despite its limitations. However, the efficacy of the vaccine varies, with recent studies estimating that the influenza vaccine reduces the risk of influenza illness by between 38% and 62%, depending on the virus strain and age and health of the recipient, among other factors. While today’s influenza vaccines are credited with significant public health benefits and offer our current best defense, only 52% of Americans get an annual influenza vaccine. As a result, a large proportion of Americans are still at risk of getting influenza yearly. For example, during the 2018-19 influenza season, 71% did not respond to vaccination and 34,200 people died of influenza-related illness in the U.S. The estimated average annual total economic burden of influenza to the U.S. healthcare system and society is more than $11.2 billion. In years when the seasonal vaccine results in sub-optimal protection such as the 2018-2019 influenza season when the CDC estimated vaccine effectiveness to be 29% in the U.S., more patients are at higher risk for serious complications resulting from influenza. Vulnerable patient populations must then rely upon therapeutic options.
Older antiviral medications, such as amantadine and rimantadine, are no longer recommended for use because of high levels of resistance. Currently, four antiviral drugs are recommended by the CDC for treating influenza:
•oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®);
•zanamivir (Relenza®);
•peramivir (Rapivab®); and
•baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza™).
The above list includes neuraminidase inhibitors and the recently approved cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, baloxavir. These molecules have one or more of the following limitations: short half-life; high susceptibility to resistance; multi-dose regimens; and dosing route limitations. The current therapies should be administered within 48 hours of symptom onset to be effective.
Potential Advantages of Cloudbreak DFCs for Influenza
•Broad-Spectrum, Universal Coverage: Cloudbreak DFCs have demonstrated activity against pandemic and seasonal influenza A and B viruses, including resistant strains (e.g. oseltamivir-resistant H1N1, zanamivir-resistant influenza B) and strains with high pandemic potential (e.g. H5N1, H7N9).
•Superior Resistance Profile: DFCs may be less prone to viral resistance, by virtue of the targeting mechanism and multivalent target engagement.
•Protection for High-Risk Populations: Unlike vaccines, the potent intrinsic antiviral activity of the DFCs has demonstrated antiviral protection independent of immune system status in animal efficacy models.
•Seasonal and Pandemic Readiness: DFCs are well-suited for immediate and robust response to influenza challenges by providing rapid onset of protection and coverage of strains that are frequently missed by the seasonal vaccine. Moreover, DFCs are not subject to the lengthy and unpredictable process of vaccine manufacturing.
•Long Duration of Action: A single DFC dose may protect from influenza for an entire influenza season.
DFC Development Candidate for Influenza: CD388
Pre-Clinical Studies of CD388 for Influenza
We have developed a novel DFC that provides a direct and sustained antiviral effect and retains potent activity in immune compromised hosts. The results of multiple preclinical studies with CD388 indicate that it is effective in both the treatment and prevention of influenza infections. CD388 has been engineered to extend half-life and has the potential to extend the duration of protection in prophylactic applications.
In Vitro Studies Measuring CD388 Potency Against Multiple Influenza Strains
We evaluated CD388 in vitro for its ability to inhibit viral replication in cell-based assays versus a large panel of seasonal and pandemic Influenza A strains, including 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain, H3N2 and H5N1, H7N9, oseltamivir (Tamiflu)-resistant H1N1, and influenza B strains, including zanamivir (Relenza)-resistant influenza B. CD388 showed potent activity against all the strains tested, including influenza B, which is less sensitive to oseltamivir phosphate.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

In Vivo Studies Measuring CD388 Potency Against Multiple Influenza Strains in Lethal Infection Models
We evaluated CD388 in vivo in lethal mouse models against multiple H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B strains. CD388 provided full protection against all strains tested H1N1 with single, low doses.
In all studies, we measured the average body weights of the mice over time to support the survival data with CD388. The CD388 dosed mice maintained stable body weights over the 21-day course of the experiments demonstrating the potency of CD388 at low doses and the potency and tolerability of CD388 at high doses. In a quantitative lung burden model versus H1N1 influenza, single, low doses of CD388 demonstrated superior reduction in lung viral burden compared to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) administered daily at 10x its human equivalent dose. Unlike oseltamivir, which only minimally impacted viral burden in lung at all tested doses, viral burden in CD388 treated animals increased with dose.
In Vivo Study Evaluating CD388 as a Long-Acting Prophylactic Agent Against Influenza
We tested mean plasma concentrations of CD388 in mice and based on the long half-life we observed, we evaluated CD388 in vivo in a lethal mouse model of H1N1 by administering CD388 to the mice 7 days before lethal influenza challenge. CD388 provided 100% protection from mortality across a broad range of dose levels, demonstrating its potential suitability as a long-acting prophylactic agent for influenza prevention.
Cloudbreak Oncology Program and Our DFC Development Candidate CD421
Cloudbreak DFCs stably couple highly potent small molecules or peptides to a proprietary variant of a human antibody fragment. As a result, DFCs are long-acting, and are designed to directly inhibit specific disease targets. DFCs can be tuned to engage the immune system or to be immune silent, expanding the breadth of indications that can be targeted. Immune active DFCs can attract an immune response against cancer cells to maximize disease eradicating activity, while immune silent DFCs allow for expansion into cancer indications where immune system engagement would result in host toxicity.
With our Cloudbreak oncology program we seek to develop a new generation of immunotherapies, and our CD421 DFC is a first-in-class CD73 inhibitor that combines the strengths of small molecules and monoclonal antibodies targeting CD73. We are advancing CD421 through IND-enabling studies.
CD421 targets CD73 in the adenosine pathway, which contributes to immune evasion in solid cancers by flooding the microenvironment surrounding tumors with adenosine, a potent immune cell suppressor. CD73 is highly expressed on a variety of tumor and stromal cells as well as immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. CD421 is designed to address the potency, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety limitations of small molecule and monoclonal antibody candidates targeting CD73 in clinical development. CD421 has several attributes that potentially differentiate it from the most advanced small molecule and mAb inhibitors in clinical development:
•Some solid tumors evade immune mediated clearance by expressing cell-anchored and soluble forms of CD73 to elevate adenosine levels in the tumor microenvironment, or TME. CD421 fully inhibited both forms of the enzyme with high potency, whereas representative CD73 inhibitor mAbs in clinical development we evaluated (mupadolimab and oleclumab), only inhibited cell anchored CD73.
•In functional assays the ability of CD421 to restore activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, suppressed with adenosine monophosphate, or AMP, were measured and compared to mAb and small molecule CD73 inhibitors in clinical development. CD421 demonstrated superior activity to the mAb comparators (mupadolimab and oleclumab), and similar or improved activity compared to the small molecule inhibitor panel.
•CD73 internalization is an additional mechanism to potentially reduce adenosine levels in the TME that is only achievable via receptor cross-linking, which is not possible with small molecule inhibitors. The multivalent presentation of CD73 inhibitors on CD421 induced receptor internalization and significant reduction of CD73 receptors expressed on a human breast cancer cell line.
•These attributes, coupled with the long half-life mediated by the DFC Fc domain, led to significant tumor reduction in a mouse syngeneic tumor model after a single dose of CD421.

Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture supplies of rezafungin, any Cloudbreak development candidates, and any future product candidates. Our third-party contract manufacturers are currently producing, and will produce in the future, our product and development candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials utilizing reliable and reproducible processes and common manufacturing techniques.
For rezafungin, we have entered into commercial supply arrangements with all of the key contract manufacturers to support commercialization, including suppliers of starting materials, bulk drug substance and drug product. We are in the 
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

process of identifying and qualifying additional manufacturers to reduce manufacturing costs and ensure continuity of supply. We have entered into commercial supply agreements with all current licensees that govern the terms under which rezafungin will be supplied for commercial use in the Melinta and Mundipharma territories.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, rezafungin, CD388, CD421, our other DFCs, our Cloudbreak platform, our processes and our know-how are important to our business. We seek to protect our proprietary position through patent protection in the U.S. and internationally where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, obtain, maintain and defend patent rights, developed internally and/or potentially licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our inventions, improvements and technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to:
•obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
•defend and enforce our current and potential future patents;
•preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
•operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
We have established, and will continue to build, proprietary positions for rezafungin, CD388, CD421, and other product candidates and technology in the U.S. and abroad. As of March 23, 2023, our patent portfolio included 10 families of patents and patent applications related to various aspects of rezafungin, 7 families of patents and patent applications related to various aspects of CD388, and one patent family of patent applications related to various aspects of CD421.
For our issued patents related to rezafungin, we expect the last to expire in 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
With respect to CD388, the latest of any patents that result from our currently pending applications would be expected to expire in 2042, should they be issued, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
With respect to CD421, the latest of any patents that result from our currently pending applications would be expected to expire in 2043, should they be issued, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or applicable patent term extensions.
Market exclusivity is the exclusive marketing right granted by the FDA and certain foreign equivalents upon the approval of a drug if certain statutory requirements are met. When granted, the applicable regulatory authority will not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication during the period of market exclusivity. The length of market exclusivity depends on the type of exclusivity granted. We intend to seek market exclusivity on our product candidates where appropriate.
The FDA has granted rezafungin designations as an Orphan Drug, QIDP and Fast Track for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis which together provide 12 years of marketing exclusivity in the U.S. to be granted at the time of FDA approval. The FDA has also granted rezafungin designations for QIDP and Fast Track for prophylactic use in patients undergoing allogeneic blood and marrow transplant which provides a five-year extension to any marketing exclusivity period for which the drug qualifies on approval.
The European Commission has granted rezafungin Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of invasive candidiasis which provides 10 years of market exclusivity protection from similar medicines with similar indications upon approval of the marketing authorization, and the potential for two additional years of market exclusivity when the results from pediatric studies compliant with an approved PIP are included in the SmPC.
Further, we seek trademark protection in the U.S. and internationally where available and when appropriate. We have filed for trademark protection in several countries for the Cidara trademark, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services and our pharmaceutical compounds. We currently have registered trademarks for the Cidara mark in the U.S., the EU, Australia and Canada.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that rezafungin and any Cloudbreak development candidates we pursue in the future, paralleled with our scientific and development expertise in the field of anti-infectives, provide us with competitive advantages over our peers. However, we face potential competition from various sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies, as well as from generic drug manufacturers, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
Rezafungin will primarily compete with antifungal classes for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis, which include polyenes, azoles and echinocandins. The approved branded therapies for this indication include Cancidas (caspofungin, marketed by Merck & Co.), Eraxis (anidulafungin, marketed by Pfizer, Inc.) and Mycamine (micafungin, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc.). There are generic versions of one or more of the current echinocandins available now, which will create added competition at the time of rezafungin regulatory approval. In addition, there are other generic products approved for candidemia, marketed by companies such as Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Mylan Inc. and Glenmark Generics Inc., among others. In addition to approved therapies, we expect that rezafungin will compete with product candidates that we are aware of in clinical development by third parties, such as fosmanogepix (PF-07842805), which is being developed by Pfizer, Inc. and brexafungerp, which is approved for other indications and is being developed for invasive candidiasis by Scynexis, Inc.
We expect that CD388 will compete against approved vaccines for influenza and approved agents for the treatment of viral influenza infections, including neuraminidase inhibitors such as Tamiflu, Relenza, and Peramivir, and endonuclease inhibitors such as Xofluza. We intend to develop other product candidates through our Cloudbreak platform for the prevention and treatment of other viral infections. We are aware of a number of approved and investigational vaccines and/or therapies in these areas. We expect that CD421 will compete against approved anticancer therapeutics as well as investigational CD73-targeting small molecule drugs, including Oric-533 being developed by Oric Pharmaceutical, Inc. and quemliclustat being developed by Arcus Biosciences, Inc. as well as monoclonal antibodies, including oleclumab being developed by AstraZeneca PLC.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with our Cloudbreak platform.
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject enrollment for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

U.S. Drug Approval Process
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•manufacturing of clinical supplies in compliance with good manufacturing practice, or GMP, regulations;
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events, and in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, including animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises safety concerns or questions related to safety to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and/or the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial conducted in the U.S. and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and, more frequently, if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and clinical NDA supplements are additionally subject to a substantial application fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, which are typically increased annually.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months from filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction via additional information submitted to the FDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the 
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track Designation
The FDA aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability of the sponsor to use surrogate endpoints in the evaluation of the pivotal clinical trials and have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Priority Review
Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is accepted for review. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A Fast Track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA’s criteria for priority review.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product and for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Qualified Infectious Disease Product Designation
In response to the growing unmet medical need in the area of serious bacterial and fungal infections, the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, is intended to provide incentives, including, for example, access to expedited FDA review for approval and five years of potential market exclusivity extension, for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products, or QIDP, including antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections that are resistant to treatment, or that treat qualifying resistant pathogens identified by the FDA. A sponsor must request QIDP designation for a new drug before an NDA is submitted. If designated as a QIDP and approved, the drug is eligible for an additional five years of exclusivity beyond any period of exclusivity to which it would have otherwise been entitled. In addition, a QIDP receives NDA priority review and Fast Track designation.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications, but it may not issue a Written Request where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which an orphan drug designation has been granted. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMS, as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
•consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Additional Health Care Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, imposes certain requirements on covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates and covered subcontractors that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing. Certain state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, as well as contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of therapies in which our products are used.
There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the U.S., for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Additionally, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication.
Outside the U.S., the commercialization of therapeutics is generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has, and will continue to, put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as our product candidates.
Healthcare Reform
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
CIDARA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. There have been executive judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been enacted. Legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact Affordable Care Act.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Additionally, in January 2013, the President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. At the federal level there have been several presidential executive orders and U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Employees
As of March 16, 2023, we had 73 total employees, 21 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 55 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 18 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources, legal or administrative support. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
