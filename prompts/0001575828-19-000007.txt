Item 1. Business
General
Frank’s International N.V. (“FINV”) is a Netherlands limited liability company (Naamloze Vennootschap) and includes the activities of Frank’s International C.V. (“FICV”), Blackhawk Group Holdings, LLC (“Blackhawk”) and their wholly owned subsidiaries (either individually or together, as context requires, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”). We were established in 1938 and are an industry-leading global provider of highly engineered tubular services, tubular fabrication and specialty well construction and well intervention solutions to the oil and gas industry. We provide our services and products to leading exploration and production companies in both offshore and onshore environments, with a focus on complex and technically demanding wells. We believe that we are one of the largest global providers of tubular services to the oil and gas industry. 
Our Operations
Tubular services involve the handling and installation of multiple joints of pipe to establish a cased wellbore and the installation of smaller diameter pipe inside a cased wellbore to provide a conduit for produced oil and gas to reach the surface. The casing of a wellbore isolates the wellbore from the surrounding geologic formations and water table, provides well structure and pressure integrity, and allows well operators to target specific zones for production. Given the central role that our services play in the structural integrity, reliability and safety of a well, and the importance of efficient tubular services to managing the overall cost of a well, we believe that our role is vital to the process of producing oil and gas.
In addition to our services offerings, we design and manufacture certain products that we sell directly to external customers, including large outside diameter (“OD”) pipe connectors. We also provide specialized fabrication and welding services in support of deepwater projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including drilling and production risers, flowlines and pipeline end terminations, as well as long-length tubulars (up to 300 feet in length) for use as caissons or pilings. Finally, we distribute large OD pipe manufactured by third parties, and generally maintain an inventory of this pipe in order to support our pipe sales and distribution operations. 
On November 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Blackhawk, the ultimate parent company of Blackhawk Specialty Tools, LLC, a leading provider of well construction and well intervention services and products. The acquisition of this new segment allowed us to combine Blackhawk’s cementing tool expertise and well intervention services with our global tubular services to offer our customers an integrated well construction solution across land, shelf and deepwater.
We offer our tubular services, tubular sales, and other well construction and well intervention services and products through our four operating segments: (1) International Services, (2) U.S. Services, (3) Tubular Sales and (4) Blackhawk, each of which is described in more detail in “Description of Business Segments.” The table below shows our consolidated revenue and each segment’s revenue and percentage of consolidated revenue for the periods indicated (revenue in thousands):

Our Corporate Structure
We are a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). As part of our initial public offering (“IPO”) in August 2013, we issued 52,976,000 shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock (the “Preferred Stock”) and a 25.7% limited partnership interest in FICV, our subsidiary, to Mosing Holdings, LLC (“Mosing Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company and affiliate of the Company with Mosing family entities as its shareholders. Under our Amended Articles of Association in effect at time of the IPO, upon the written election of Mosing Holdings, each Preferred Share, together with a unit in FICV, our subsidiary, was convertible into a share of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. 
On August 19, 2016, we received notice from Mosing Holdings exercising its right to exchange (the “Exchange Right”) for an equivalent number of each of the following securities for common shares: (i) 52,976,000 Preferred Shares and (ii) 52,976,000 units in FICV. We issued 52,976,000 common shares to Mosing Holdings on August 26, 2016. As a result, there are no remaining issued Preferred Shares and Mosing Holdings no longer has a minority interest holding in FICV. As of February 18, 2019, the Mosing family collectively owns approximately 62% of our common shares.
Description of Business Segments
International Services
The International Services segment provides tubular services in international offshore markets and in several onshore international regions in approximately 50 countries on six continents. Our customers in these international markets are primarily large exploration and production companies, including integrated oil and gas companies and national oil and gas companies, and other oilfield services companies.
U.S. Services
The U.S. Services segment provides tubular services in the active onshore oil and gas drilling regions in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale, Marcellus/Utica Shale, Niobrara Shale, Woodford Shale, Green River Basin and Uintah Basin, as well as in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Tubular Sales
The Tubular Sales segment designs, manufactures and distributes large OD pipe, connectors and casing attachments and sells large OD pipe originally manufactured by various pipe mills. We also provide specialized fabrication and welding services in support of offshore projects, including drilling and production risers, flowlines and pipeline end terminations, as well as long-length tubulars (up to 300 feet in length) for use as caissons or pilings. This segment also designs and manufactures proprietary equipment for use in our International Services and U.S. Services segments.
Blackhawk
The Blackhawk segment provides well construction and well intervention services and products, in addition to cementing tool expertise, in the U.S. and Mexican Gulf of Mexico, onshore U.S. and other select international locations. Blackhawk’s customer base consists primarily of major and independent oil and gas companies as well as other oilfield services companies.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
We acquire component parts, products and raw materials from suppliers, including foundries, forge shops, and original equipment manufacturers. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our product lines (primarily pipe) are only available from a limited number of suppliers (primarily in the Tubular Sales segment).
Our ability to source low cost raw materials and components, such as steel castings and forgings, is critical to our ability to manufacture our casing products competitively and, in turn, our ability to provide onshore and offshore casing services. In order to purchase raw materials and components in a cost effective manner, we have developed a broad international 
5

sourcing capability and we maintain quality assurance and testing programs to analyze and test these raw materials and components. 

Patents
We currently hold multiple U.S. and international patents and have a number of pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license as critical or essential to our business as a whole. 
Seasonality
A substantial portion of our business is not significantly impacted by changing seasons. We can be impacted by hurricanes, ocean currents, winter storms and other disruptions. 
Customers
Our customers consist primarily of oil and gas exploration and production companies, both domestic and international, including major and independent companies, national oil companies and, on occasion, other service companies that have contractual obligations to provide casing and handling services or comparable services. Demand for our services depends primarily upon the capital spending of oil and gas companies and the level of drilling activity in the U.S. and internationally. We do not believe the loss of any of our individual customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2017 and 2016, one customer accounted for 10% and 13% of our revenues, respectively. For both years, all four of our segments generated revenue from this customer. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are competitive. We compete with a number of companies, some of which have financial and other resources greater than ours. The principal competitive factors in our markets are the quality, price and availability of products and services and a company’s responsiveness to customer needs and its reputation for safety. In general, we face a larger number of smaller, more regionally-specific competitors in the U.S. onshore market as compared to offshore markets, where larger competitors dominate. 
We believe several factors give us a strong competitive position. In particular, we believe our products and services in each segment fulfill our customer’s requirements for international capability, availability of tools, range of services provided, intellectual property, technological sophistication, quality assurance systems and availability of equipment, along with reputation and safety record. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing a rapid response to the needs of our customers, a high level of customer service and innovative product development initiatives. Although we have no single competitor across all of our product lines, we believe that Weatherford International represents our most direct competitor across our segments for providing tubular services, specialty well construction and well intervention services and products on an aggregate, global basis. 
Market Environment
Despite recent headwinds, in 2019 we expect to see increased customer spending globally on oil and natural gas exploration and production in response to the continued stabilization of commodity prices. Much of the anticipated increase in spending will continue to be associated with U.S. onshore projects, although we anticipate the rate of spending outside of U.S. onshore to increase in 2019. Activity in the deep and ultra-deep offshore markets is expected to see some modest improvement in 2019, and pricing of newly sanctioned projects is estimated to be marginally higher than recent trends. In many international offshore shelf markets, we are seeing increased activity as operators are increasingly seeing improved economics at current commodity prices. In response, we will continue our efforts to expand products and services historically weighted to the U.S. market to international markets, reducing costs through operational efficiency gains and prioritizing projects that improve market share and profitability.

Inventories and Working Capital
An important consideration for many of our customers in selecting a vendor is timely availability of the product or service. Often customers will pay a premium for earlier or immediate availability because of the cost of delays in critical operations. This availability is especially critical for our proprietary products, causing us to carry inventories for these products. For critical capital items for which demand is expected to be strong, we often build certain items before we have a firm order. Having such goods available on short notice can be of great value to our customers. 
Inventories are required to be stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. During 2017, we recorded an impairment of $51.2 million related to a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment for our pipe and connectors inventory, which is included in the financial statement line item severance and other charges (credits), net on our consolidated statements of operations. The factors that led to this impairment included new technology (external and internal), oil and gas prices below levels necessary for our customers to sanction a significant amount of new offshore projects in the near-term and a change in customers’ preferences for newer technologies, all of which significantly impacted the net realizable value of our connectors inventory. 
We cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Orders are placed with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, we may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. If we overestimate customer demand, we may allocate resources to the purchase of material or manufactured products that we may not be able to sell when we expect to, if at all. 
Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 
Our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, occupational health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of orders or injunctions to prohibit or restrict certain activities or force future compliance. 
Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), analogous state agencies and, in certain circumstances, citizens’ groups, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Certain environmental laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. The trend in environmental regulation has been to impose increasingly stringent restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills of regulated substances may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with RCRA. Certain petroleum exploration and production wastes are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations. However, it is possible that these wastes will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA 
7

Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes. The consent decree requires EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for any revisions relating to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating expenses or the operating expenses of our customers, which could result in decreased demand for our services.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. We also contract with waste removal services and landfills. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. 
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility from which a discharge occurs. Previously, in 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers finalized a rule that would significantly expand the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdictional, potential expanding the areas that would require permits prior to commencing construction or exploration and production activities. This rule has the potential to adversely affect our U.S. customers, which in turn could decrease demand for our services. However, in December 2018 the EPA proposed several legal challenges to the rule followed, along with attempts to stay implementation following the change in presidential administration. Currently, the rule is being implemented in 22 states but is enjoined in 28 states. Recently, in December 2018, the EPA and the Corps proposed a replacement rule that provides for more limited Clean Water Act Jurisdiction. Several groups have already announced their intentions to challenge the proposed rule. Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act is uncertain at this time. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water from our operations and may be required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil, including refined petroleum products.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other emission control requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting non-compliant operations. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or NAAQS, for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion and completed attainment/nonattainment designation in July 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter air emissions permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. We do not believe that any of our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act permitting or regulatory requirements for major sources of air emissions, but some of our facilities 
8

could be subject to state “minor source” air permitting requirements and other state regulatory requirements applicable to air emissions, such as source registration and recordkeeping requirements. 
Climate Change
The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA has proposed various measures regulating the emission of greenhouse gases, including proposed performance standards for new and existing power plants, and pre-construction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources already subject to the Clean Air Act. Many of these actions are currently subject to legal challenge and we cannot predict what the final scope of federal greenhouse gas regulations may be or the costs that our operations or the operations of our customers may incur as a result of such regulations. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, as well as onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities, on an annual basis.
The EPA had previously finalized standards in June 2016 designed to reduce methane emissions from certain oil and gas facilities by installing additional pollution controls and requiring enhanced leak detection and repair programs. In June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay portions of these 2016 standards for two years and reconsider the entirety of the 2016 standards, but in July 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that such a stay was unlawful. In September 2018, the EPA proposed amendments to the 2016 standards that would relax the rule’s fugitive emissions monitoring requirements and expand exceptions to pneumatic pump requirements, among other changes. Various industry and environmental groups separately challenged the original and amended methane requirements and the EPA’s attempts to delay implementation of the rules. In addition, in April 2018, several states filed a lawsuit that seeks to compel the EPA to issue methane performance standards for existing sources in the oil and natural gas source category. These methane rules, to the extent implemented, have the potential to impose significant costs on our customers. Moreover, as a result of the developments described above, substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of the EPA’s 2016 methane rule. However, given the long-term trend toward increasing regulation, future federal greenhouse regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility, and several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas production activities.
While the U.S. Congress has yet to adopt legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, many of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, the state of California has adopted a “cap and trade program” that requires major sources of greenhouse gas emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France, that calls for countries to set their own greenhouse gas emissions targets and be transparent about the measures each country will use to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions targets (“Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force on November 4, 2016; however, the Paris Agreement does not impose any binding obligations on its participants. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs in the U.S. or abroad designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances, pay carbon taxes, or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Also, new legislation or regulatory programs related to the control of greenhouse gas emissions could encourage the use of alternative fuels or otherwise increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and gas produced by our customers. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
9

Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating or reducing their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, and acquisition activities, which in turn could decrease demand for our services and products and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Shareholder activists have also put forth proposals directly to energy companies that, if successful, could require such companies to adopt carbon emission reduction targets or otherwise shift their operations away from less carbon intensive activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other extreme weather events. Offshore operations are particularly susceptible to damage from extreme weather events. If any of the potential effects of climate change were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice in the oil and gas industry. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into a formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production of hydrocarbons. While we may provide supporting products through Blackhawk, we do not perform hydraulic fracturing, but many of our onshore customers utilize this technique. Certain environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies have suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process, and have made claims that hydraulic fracturing techniques are harmful to surface water and drinking water resources and may cause earthquakes. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly or indirectly. For example, the EPA has already begun to regulate certain hydraulic fracturing operations involving diesel under the Underground Injection Control program of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, which concluded “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water sources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local - or regional - scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. Based on the report’s findings, additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing by the EPA appears unlikely at this time. However, states and local governments may also seek to limit hydraulic fracturing activities through time, place, and manner restrictions on operations or ban the process altogether. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs that restrict hydraulic fracturing could adversely affect, reduce or delay well drilling and completion activities, increase the cost of drilling and production, and thereby reduce demand for our services.
Employee Health and Safety
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes, establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. 
We also operate in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may impose similar legal requirements. We do not believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse impact on us. However, we also believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards and, thus, we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future.
10

Operating Risk and Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses. 
Currently, our insurance program includes, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicle, workers’ compensation, and employer’s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 3,100 employees worldwide. We are a party to collective bargaining agreements or other similar arrangements in certain international areas in which we operate, such as Brazil, Asia Pacific, Africa and Europe. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
