  General
 
  Our Company
  
  LightPath Technologies, Inc. (“LightPath”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) was incorporated under Delaware law in 1992 as the successor to LightPath Technologies Limited Partnership, a New Mexico limited partnership formed in 1989, and its predecessor, Integrated Solar Technologies Corporation, a New Mexico corporation formed in 1985. Today, LightPath is a global company with major facilities in the United States, the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Latvia. Our capabilities include precision molded optics, thermal imaging optics and custom designed optics. These capabilities allow us to manufacture optical components and higher-level assemblies, including precision molded glass aspheric optics, molded and diamond-turned infrared aspheric lenses and other optical materials used to produce products that manipulate light.  We design, develop, manufacture and distribute optical components and assemblies utilizing advanced optical manufacturing processes. We serve a wide and diverse number of industries including defense and security, optical systems and components, datacom/telecom, information technology, life sciences, machine vision and production technology. Our products are incorporated into a variety of applications by our broad and diverse customer base. These applications include defense products, medical devices, laser aided industrial tools, automotive safety applications, barcode scanners, optical data storage, hybrid fiber coax datacom, telecommunication optical networks, machine vision and sensors, among others. All the products we produce enable lasers and imaging devices to function more effectively.  For example:
  
   ●
 Molded glass aspheres and assemblies are used in various high-performance optical applications primarily based on laser technology;

   ●
 Infrared molded lenses, diamond turned, conventional and CNC ground and polished lenses and assemblies using short (“SWIR”), mid (“MWIR”) and long (“LWIR”) wave transmitting materials are used in applications for firefighting, predictive maintenance, homeland security, surveillance, automotive, cell phone infrared cameras, pharmaceutical research & development and defense; and

   ●
 Collimator assemblies are used in applications involving light detection and ranging (“LIDAR”) technology for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles, such as fork lifts and other automated warehouse equipment.

 
  The Company has robust and innovative manufacturing technologies and is vertically integrated from optical design through testing. Manufacturing strengths include the ability to use multiple optical glasses (visible and infrared spectrums), multiple lens fabrication methods (precision molding, single point diamond turning, and both conventional and CNC grind and polish), anti-reflective coatings, wear resistant coatings (such as diamond-like carbon or “DLC”), assembly and test.
  
  Subsidiaries
  
  In November 2005, we formed LightPath Optical Instrumentation (Shanghai) Co., Ltd (“LPOI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, located in Jiading, People’s Republic of China. The LPOI facility (the “Shanghai Facility”) is primarily used for sales and support functions.

  In December 2013, we formed LightPath Optical Instrumentation (Zhenjiang) Co., Ltd. (“LPOIZ”), a wholly-owned subsidiary located in the New City district, of the Jiangsu province, of the People’s Republic of China. LPOIZ’s manufacturing facility (the “Zhenjiang Facility”) serves as our primary manufacturing facility in China and provides a lower cost structure for production of larger volumes of optical components and assemblies. Late in fiscal 2019, this facility was expanded from 39,000 to 55,000 square feet to add capacity for polishing to support our growing infrared business.
  
 In December 2016, we acquired ISP Optics Corporation, a New York corporation (“ISP”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ISP Optics Latvia, SIA, a limited liability company founded in 1998 under the Laws of the Republic of Latvia (“ISP Latvia”). ISP is a vertically integrated manufacturer offering a full range of infrared products from custom infrared optical elements to catalog and high-performance lens assemblies. Historically, ISP’s Irvington, New York facility (the “Irvington Facility”) functioned as its global headquarters for operations, while also providing manufacturing capabilities, optical coatings, and optical and mechanical design, assembly, and testing. In June 2019, we completed the relocation of this manufacturing facility to our existing facilities in Orlando, Florida and Riga, Latvia. ISP Latvia is a manufacturer of high precision optics and offers a full range of infrared products, including catalog and custom infrared optics. ISP Latvia’s manufacturing facility is located in Riga, Latvia (the “Riga Facility”).
  
  Recent Organizational and Strategic Initiatives
  
 To ensure we fully leverage the expanded capabilities and manage the broader product portfolio that we now have, we begun introducing organizational changes in July 2019. The position of Chief Operating Officer was created and filled. This position combines all operations, engineering, sales and marketing functions under one leader to ensure the closest possible ties between demand and supply of our products. We believe this will ensure the best coordination between technical and operational requirements. The position is responsible for managing annual plan objectives, i.e., revenues, gross margin, controllable operating income and return on asset objectives. We have also implemented a product management function, with a product manager for each of our major product capabilities: molded optics, thermal imaging optics and custom designed optics. Product management is principally a portfolio management process that analyzes products within the product capability areas as defined above. This function will facilitate choosing investment priorities and ensuring successful product life cycle management. We have also defined, but not filled, the position of Senior Vice President, Strategic Business Assessment. This person will be responsible to strategically align LighPath’s competencies with strategic industry revenue opportunities, and will manage the product management function.
  Product Groups and Markets
 
  Overview
  
  In fiscal 2019, we reorganized our business into three product groups: precision molded optics (“PMO”), infrared products and specialty products. These product groups are supported by our major product capabilities: molded optics, thermal imaging optics, and custom designed optics.
  
  Our PMO product group consists of visible precision molded optics with varying applications. Our infrared product group is comprised of infrared optics, both molded and diamond-turned, and thermal imaging assemblies. This product group also includes both conventional and CNC ground and polished lenses. Between these two product groups, we have the capability to manufacture lenses from very small (with diameters of sub-millimeter) to over 300 millimeters, and with focal lengths from approximately 0.4mm to over 2000mm. In addition, both product groups offer both catalog and custom designed optics.
  
  Our specialty product group is comprised of value-added products, such as optical subsystems, assemblies, and collimators, and non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) products, consisting of those products we develop pursuant to product development agreements that we enter into with customers. Typically, customers approach us and request that we develop new products or applications for our existing products to fit their particular needs or specifications. The timing and extent of any such product development is outside of our control.
  
  We have also aligned our marketing efforts by our capabilities (i.e., molded optics, thermal imaging optics, and custom optics), and then by industry. We currently serve the following major markets: defense and security, optical systems and components, datacom/telecom, information technology, life sciences, machine vision and production technology. Customers in each of these markets may select the best optical technologies that suit their needs from our entire suite of products, availing us to cross-selling opportunities, particularly where we can leverage our knowledge base against our expanding design library. Within our product groups, we have various applications that serve our major markets. For example, our infrared products can be used for gas sensing devices, spectrometers, night vision systems, advanced driver-assistance systems (“ADAS”), thermal weapon gun sights, and infrared counter measure systems, among others.

  The photonics market drives our growth and is comprised of eight application areas: information and communication technology, display, lighting, photovoltaic, production technology, life sciences, and measurement and automated vision. In 2018, the market size for these applications at the system level was $556.4 billion. LightPath has product applications in six of the eight application areas, all except for displays and photovoltaic. According to the latest Markets and Markets survey, these six application areas had an estimated market value of $401 billion and are growing at a 7% compound annual growth rate. Within the larger overall markets, we believe there is a market of approximately $2.0 billion for our current products and capabilities. We continue to believe our products will provide significant growth opportunities over the next several years and, therefore, we will continue to target specific applications in each of these major markets. In addition to these major markets, a large percentage of our revenues are derived from sales to unaffiliated companies that purchase our products to fulfill their customers’ orders, as well as unaffiliated companies that offer our products for sale in their catalogs. Our strategy is to leverage our technology, know-how, established low-cost manufacturing capability and partnerships to grow our business. Our product managers will focus on pursuing customer growth opportunities where our differential advantages coincide with key customer needs.
  
  Product Groups
  
  The following further discusses the various products we offer and certain growth opportunities we anticipate for each such product.
  
  PMO Product Group. Aspheric lenses are known for their optimal performance. Aspheric lenses simplify and shrink optical systems by replacing several conventional lenses. However, aspheric lenses can be difficult and costly to machine. Our glass molding technology enables the production of both low and high volumes of aspheric optics, while still maintaining the highest quality at an affordable price. Molding is the most consistent and economical way to produce aspheres and we have perfected this method to offer the most precise molded aspheric lenses available.
  
  Infrared Product Group. Our infrared product group is comprised of both molded and turned infrared lenses and assemblies using a variety of infrared glass materials. Advances in chalcogenide materials have enabled compression molding for MWIR and LWIR optics in a process similar to precision molded lenses. Our molded infrared optics technology enables high performance, cost-effective infrared aspheric lenses that do not rely on traditional diamond turning or lengthy polishing methods. Utilizing precision molded aspheric optics significantly reduces the number of lenses required for typical thermal imaging systems and the cost to manufacture these lenses. Molding is an excellent alternative to traditional lens processing methods particularly where volume and repeatability is required.
  
  Through ISP, our wholly-owned subsidiary, we also offer germanium, silicon or zinc selenide aspheres and spherical lenses, which are manufactured by diamond turning. This manufacturing technique allows us to offer larger lens sizes and the ability to use other optical materials that cannot be effectively molded. The capabilities we have from ISP give us the ability to meet complex optical challenges that demand more exotic optical substrate materials that are non-moldable, as well as larger size optics.
  
 Near the end of fiscal 2018, we announced comprehensive production capabilities and global availability for a new line of infrared lenses made from chalcogenide glass. We developed this glass and melt it internally to produce our Black Diamond glass, which has been trademarked, and is marketed as BD6. Currently, the majority of our thermal imaging products are germanium-based, which is subject to market pricing and availability. BD6 offers a lower-cost alternative to germanium, which we expect will benefit the cost structure of some of our current infrared products and allow us to expand our product offerings in response to the markets’ increasing requirement for low-cost infrared optics applications.
  
  Overall, we anticipate growth for infrared optics and increased requirements for systems requiring aspheric optics. Infrared systems, which include thermal imaging cameras, gas sensing devices, spectrometers, night vision systems, automotive driver awareness systems, such as blind spot detection, thermal weapon sights, and infrared counter measure systems, represent a market that is growing rapidly and are applications into which we are selling. As infrared imaging systems become widely available, the cost of optical components needs to decrease before the market demand will increase. Our aspheric molding process is an enabling technology for the cost reduction and commercialization of infrared imaging systems utilizing smaller lenses because the aspheric shape of our lenses enables system designers to reduce the lens element in a system and provide similar performance at a lower cost. In addition, there is a trend toward utilizing smaller size sensors in these devices which require smaller size lenses and that fits well with our molding technology.
  
  Specialty Product Group. We have a growing group of custom specialty optics products and assemblies that take advantage of our unique technologies and capabilities. These products include custom optical designs, mounted lenses, optical assemblies, and collimator assemblies. We expect growth from defense communications programs and commercial optical sub-assemblies.
  
  We design, build, and sell optical assemblies into markets for test and measurement, medical devices, military, industrial, and communications based on our proprietary technologies. Many of our optical assemblies consist of several products that we manufacture.

  Growth Strategy
  
  Our strategy is to leverage our technology, know-how, established low cost manufacturing capability and partnerships to grow our business. We plan to accomplish this growth through the implementation of the following objectives:
  
  ●
Leverage our Leadership to Drive Organic Growth. We plan to continue to capitalize on our global operations network, distribution infrastructure, and technology to pursue global growth. We will focus our efforts on those geographic areas and end products that we believe offer the most attractive growth and long-term profit prospects.

 
  ●
Focus on Cash Flow Generation. Our goal is to focus on cash flow generation and return on invested capital through the continuing optimization of our cost structure, improvement in working capital and supply chain efficiencies, a disciplined approach to capital expenditures, and profitable revenue growth. We have a proven track record of mitigating fixed cost inflation with cost saving actions and productivity improvements. We intend to continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities based in large part on benchmarks of industry-leading performance and productivity improvements by utilizing our engineering and manufacturing technology expertise and partnerships with low cost producers. Our goal is to maintain a cost structure that positions us favorably to compete and grow. In particular, we view our BD6 material manufacturing capability as a key differential advantage to drive growth in our infrared product group. We intend to continue to upgrade our customer and product mix by adding products that move up the supply chain by offering assemblies that use our lenses, thereby increasing our sales of value-added, differentiated products, and achieving premium pricing to improve margins and enhance cash flow.

 
  ●
Increase Customer Base and Continue to Develop New Products. A key component of our strategy is to produce innovative, high-performance products that offer enhanced value propositions to our customers at competitive prices. Our goal is to continually work closely with our customers to provide solutions and productions that optimize their products. This market-driven product development enables us to offer a high-quality product portfolio to our customers and provide our business with the ability to respond quickly and efficiently to changes in market demands.

 
  ●
Deepen Our Presence in Emerging Markets. Emerging markets are a strategic priority for our business. We are well positioned not only to leverage our strong market positions in mature but highly sophisticated markets in North America and Europe, but also to participate in the expected growth of emerging markets in Asia and Eastern Europe. We believe that improving living standards and growth in GDP across emerging markets are combining to create increased demand for our products. We expect to capitalize on this growth opportunity by expanding our customer base and local capabilities in order to increase our market share across emerging markets, especially in China. To accelerate our penetration of these markets and maintain our competitive cost position, we may develop relationships with leading local partners, especially in businesses where participation in the fast-growing Chinese market is particularly important for long-term sustainable growth. For example, we are well positioned to leverage our strong production technology in the Chinese market as a result of an increasing percentage of aerospace, automotive, semiconductor, electronics, and telecommunications manufacturing transitioning to China.

 
  ●
Continue to Drive Operational Excellence and Asset Efficiency. Operational excellence, which includes a commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, and improved reliability, is key to our future success. We continually evaluate our business to identify opportunities to increase operational efficiency throughout our production facilities, with a focus on maintaining operational excellence, reducing costs, and maximizing asset efficiency. We intend to continue focusing on increasing manufacturing efficiencies through selected capital projects, process improvements, and best practices in order to lower unit costs. We will also carefully manage our portfolio and take appropriate actions to address product lines that face challenging market conditions and do not generate returns on invested capital that we believe are sufficient to create long-term shareholder value.

 
  ●
Drive Organizational Alignment. We believe that maintaining alignment of the efforts of our employees with our overall business strategy and operational excellence goals is critical to our success. We have outstanding people and assets and, with the commitment to values of safety, customer appreciation, simplicity, collective entrepreneurship, and integrity, we believe that we can maintain our competitiveness and help achieve our operational excellence and asset efficiency strategic objectives.

  Sales and Marketing
  
  Marketing. Extensive product diversity and varying levels of product maturity characterize the optics industry. Product markets range from consumer (e.g., cameras and copiers) to industrial (e.g., lasers, data storage, and infrared imaging), from products where the lenses are the central feature (e.g., telescopes, microscopes, and lens systems) to products incorporating lens components (e.g., robotics and semiconductor production equipment) and communications (e.g., various optics are required for bandwidth expansion and improved data transfer for the optical network). As a result, we market our products across a wide variety of customer groups, including laser systems manufacturers, laser OEMs, infrared-imaging systems vendors, industrial laser tool manufacturers, telecommunications equipment manufacturers, medical and industrial measurement equipment manufacturers, government defense agencies, and research institutions worldwide.
  
  Technical Sales Model. To align the organization for specific goals and accountability, we created the position of Chief Operating Officer with the responsibility for all operations, engineering, and sales and marketing. This organizational structure enables the close coordination of supply with demand. We have also created a product management function to manage the portfolio of products and define the best growth opportunities for LightPath. Our Sales and Marketing organization will be led by the Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing.
  
  Sales Team & Channel.  We have expanded our inside sales and application engineering organization to better support our regional sales forces that market and sell our products directly to customers in North America, Europe and China. We also have a master distributor in Europe. We have formalized relationships with 15 industrial, laser, and optoelectronics distributors and channel partners located in the United States (“U.S.”) and various foreign countries to assist in the distribution of our products in highly specific target markets. We also have reseller arrangements with the top three product catalog companies in the optics and opto-electronics market. In addition, we also maintain our own product catalog and internet websites (www.lightpath.com and www.ispoptics.com) as vehicles for broader promotion of our products. We make use of print media advertisements in various trade magazines and participate in appropriate domestic and foreign trade shows.
  
  All of our partners work diligently to expand opportunities in emerging geographic markets and through alternate channels of distribution. We believe that we provide a high level of support in developing and maintaining our long-term relationships with our customers. Customer service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners that are located throughout the world.
  
  Trade Shows. We display our product line additions and enhancements at one or more trade shows each year. For example, we participated in several U.S.-based shows including Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers (“SPIE”) Photonics West in February 2019 and SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing in April 2019. In addition, we exhibit at the Laser World of Photonics in Munich, Germany to maintain our European presence, and intend to exhibit at the China International Optoelectronic Expo (“CIOE”) in September 2019.  This strategy underscores our strategic directive of broadening our base of innovative optical components and assemblies. These trade shows also provide an opportunity to meet with and enhance existing business relationships, meet and develop potential customers, and to distribute information and samples regarding our products.
  
  Competition
  
  The market for optical components generally is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with manufacturers of conventional spherical lenses and optical components, providers of aspheric lenses and optical components, and producers of optical quality glass. To a lesser extent, we compete with developers of specialty optical components and assemblies, particularly as related to our custom products within the infrared product group. Many of these competitors have greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources than we do.
  
  We believe our unique capabilities in optical design engineering, our low-cost structure and our substantial presence in Europe and Asia, provides us with a competitive edge and assists us in securing business. Additionally, we believe that we offer value to some customers as a primary or backup supply source in the U.S. should they be unwilling to commit to purchase their supply of a critical component from a foreign production source. We also have a broad product offering to satisfy a variety of applications and markets.
  
  PMO Product Group. Our PMO products compete with conventional lenses and optical components manufactured by companies such as Asia Optical Co., Inc., Anteryon BV, Rochester Precision Optics, and Sunny Optical Technology (Group) Company Limited. Aspheric lens system manufacturers include Panasonic Corporation, Alps Electric Co., Ltd., Hoya Corporation, as well as newer competitors from China and Taiwan, such as E-Pin Optical Industry Co., Ltd., and Kinik Company.
  
  Our aspheric lenses compete with lens systems comprised of multiple conventional lenses. Machined aspheric lenses compete with our molded glass aspheric lenses. The use of aspheric surfaces provides the optical designer with a powerful tool in correcting spherical aberrations and enhancing performance in state-of-the-art optical products. However, we believe that our optical design expertise and our flexibility in providing custom high-performance optical components at a low price are key competitive advantages for us over these competitors.

  Plastic molded aspheres and hybrid plastic/glass aspheric optics, on the other hand, allow for high volume production, but primarily are limited to low cost consumer products that do not place a high demand on performance (such as plastic lenses in disposable or mobile phone cameras). Molded plastic aspheres appear in products that stress cost or weight as their measure of success over performance and durability. Our low-cost structure allows us to compete with these lenses based on higher performance and durability from our glass lenses at only a small premium in price.
  
  Infrared Product Group. Our infrared aspheric optics compete with optical products produced by Janos Technology LLC, Ophir Optronics Solutions, Ernst Leitz Canada (ELCAN) Optical Technologies, Clear Align and a variety of Eastern European and Asian manufacturers. These traditional infrared lenses can either be polished spherical or are diamond turned aspherical. Our molded lenses compete with spherical lenses because like all aspheres they can replace doublets or triplets based on the higher performance of an aspheric lens. Our diamond turned aspheres from germanium are more expensive to produce in high volumes and time consuming to manufacture. We now also offer diamond-turned BD6 (chalcogenide) at lower cost giving us a competitive advantage. We believe our low cost, high volume lens business technology combined with our recently added traditional polishing and diamond turning capabilities enables us to compete with the other manufacturers of traditional infrared lens by offering the best technology fit at a competitive price.
  
  Our molded infrared optics competes with products manufactured by Umicore N.V. (“Umicore”), Rochester Precision Optics, and Yunnan KIRP-CH Photonics Co., Ltd. We believe that our optical design expertise, our BD6-based product offerings, our diverse manufacturing flexibility, and our manufacturing facilities located in Asia, Europe and North America are key advantages over the products manufactured by these competitors.
  
  Manufacturing
  
  Facilities. Our manufacturing is largely performed in our combined 38,000 square feet of production facilities in Orlando, Florida (the “Orlando Facility”), in LPOIZ’s combined 55,000 square feet of production facilities in Zhenjiang, China, and in ISP Latvia’s 23,000 square feet of production facilities in Riga, Latvia. LPOI sales and support functions occupy a 1,900 square foot facility in Shanghai. ISP previously had an approximately 13,000 square foot facility in Irvington, New York that functioned as its operations headquarters, providing manufacturing capabilities, optical coatings, optical and mechanical design, assembly and testing, as well as some engineering, administrative and sales functions. During fiscal 2019, we added manufacturing space near our existing Orlando Facility, and relocated the manufacturing operations of ISP’s Irvington Facility to our existing Orlando Facility and Riga Facility, which is expected to result in substantial cost savings. Some of the manufacturing operations previously performed in the Irvington Facility were transitioned to our Zhenjiang Facility.
  
  Our Orlando Facility and LPOIZ’s Zhenjiang Facility feature areas for each step of the manufacturing process, including coating work areas, preform manufacturing and a clean room for precision glass molding and integrated assembly. The Orlando and Zhenjiang Facilities include new product development laboratories and space that includes development and metrology equipment. The Orlando and Zhenjiang Facilities have anti-reflective and infrared coating equipment to coat our lenses in-house. ISP Latvia’s Riga Facility includes fully vertically integrated manufacturing processes to produce high precision infrared lenses and infrared lens assemblies, including crystal growth, CNC grinding, conventional polishing, diamond turning, multilayer coatings, assemblies and state of the art metrology.
  
 We are routinely adding additional production equipment at our Orlando, Zhenjiang and Riga Facilities. During fiscal 2018, we added additional space in both our Zhenjiang and Riga Facilities. In fiscal 2019, we completed our expansion in Orlando and closed the Irvington Facility, moving the manufacturing operations to the Orlando Facility and the Riga Facility. We also completed an expansion to our Zhenjiang operation increasing our preform capacity. In addition to adding additional equipment or space at our manufacturing facilities, we add additional work shifts, as needed, to increase capacity and meet forecasted demand. We intend to monitor the capacity at our facilities, and will increase such space as needed. We believe our facilities are adequate to accommodate our needs over the next year.
  
  Production and Equipment. Our Orlando Facility contains glass melting capability for BD6 chalcogenide glass, a manufacturing area for our molded glass aspheres, multiple anti-reflective and wear resistant coating chambers, diamond turning machines and accompanying metrology equipment offering full scale diamond turning lens capability, a tooling and machine shop to support new product development, commercial production requirements for our machined parts, the fabrication of proprietary precision glass molding machines and mold equipment, and a clean room for our molding and assembly workstations and related metrology equipment. LPOIZ’s Zhenjiang Facility features precision glass molding manufacturing area, clean room, machine shop, dicing area, and thin film coating chambers for anti-reflective coatings on both visible and infrared optics and related metrology equipment.
  
  ISP Latvia’s Riga Facility consists of crystal growth, grinding, polishing, diamond turning, quality control departments and a mechanical shop to provide the departments with the necessary tooling. The crystal growth department is equipped with multiple furnaces to grow water soluble crystals. The grind and polish department has modern CNC equipment, lens centering and conventional equipment to perform spindle, double sided and continuous polishing operations. The diamond turning department has numerous diamond turning machines accompanied with the latest metrology tools. In connection with the relocation of the Irvington Facility, we have increased the diamond turning capacity in this facility. The quality control department contains numerous inspection stations with various equipment to perform optical testing of finished optics.

  The Orlando, Zhenjiang, and Riga Facilities are ISO 9001:2015 certified. The Zhenjiang Facility is also ISO/TS 1649:2009 automotive certified for manufacturing of optical lenses and accessories. The Orlando Facility is International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) compliant and registered with the U.S. Department of State. The Riga Facility has a DSP-5 ITAR license and Technical Assistance Agreement in place that allows this facility to manufacture items with ITAR requirements.
  
  For more information regarding our facilities, please see Item 2. Properties in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
  
  Subcontractors and Strategic Alliances.  We believe that low-cost manufacturing is crucial to our long-term success. In that regard, we generally use subcontractors in our production process to accomplish certain processing steps requiring specialized capabilities. For example, we presently use a number of qualified subcontractors for fabricating, polishing, and coating certain lenses, as necessary. We have taken steps to protect our proprietary methods of repeatable high-quality manufacturing by patent disclosures and internal trade secret controls.
  
  Suppliers.  We utilize a number of glass compositions in manufacturing our molded glass aspheres and lens array products.  These glasses or equivalents are available from a large number of suppliers, including CDGM Glass Company Ltd., Ohara Corporation, and Sumita Optical Glass, Inc. Base optical materials, used in both infrared glass and collimator products, are manufactured and supplied by a number of optical and glass manufacturers. ISP utilizes major infrared material suppliers located around the globe for a broad spectrum of infrared crystal and glass. The development of our manufacturing capability for BD6 glass provides a low-cost internal source for infrared glass. We believe that a satisfactory supply of such production materials will continue to be available, at reasonable or, in some cases, increased prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
  
  We also rely on local and regional vendors for component materials and services such as housings, fixtures, chemicals and inert gases, specialty ceramics, UV and AR coatings, and other specialty coatings. In addition, certain products require external processing, such as anodizing and metallization. To date, we are not dependent on any of these manufacturers and have found a suitable number of qualified vendors and suppliers for these materials and services.
  
  We currently purchase a few key materials from single or limited sources. We believe that a satisfactory supply of production materials will continue to be available at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, patents, trade secret protection, trademarks, and copyrights. We primarily rely upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how to protect certain process inventions, lens designs, and innovations. We have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the extent that is reasonable.
  
  In addition to trade secrets and proprietary know-how, we have three remaining patents that relate to the fusing of certain of our lenses that are part of our specialty products group. These patents expire at various times through 2023. We also are in the process of applying for multiple new patents.
  
  Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Patent, trademark, and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or technology is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims.
  
  We own several registered and unregistered service marks and trademarks that are used in the marketing and sale of our products. The following table sets forth our registered and unregistered service marks and trademarks, if registered, the country in which the mark is filed, and the renewal date for such mark.

 Environmental and Governmental Regulation
  
  Currently, emissions and waste from our manufacturing processes are at such low levels that no special environmental permits or licenses are required. In the future, we may need to obtain special permits for disposal of increased waste by-products. The glass materials we utilize contain some toxic elements in a stabilized molecular form. However, the high temperature diffusion process results in low-level emissions of such elements in gaseous form. If production reaches a certain level, we believe that we will be able to efficiently recycle certain of our raw material waste, thereby reducing disposal levels. We believe that we are presently in compliance with all material federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits necessary for the operation of our business.
  
  We also utilize certain chemicals, solvents, and adhesives in our manufacturing process. We believe we maintain all necessary permits and are in full compliance with all applicable regulations.
  
  To our knowledge, there are currently no U.S. federal, state, or local regulations that restrict the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Certain end-user applications require government approval of the complete optical system, such as U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for use in endoscopy. In these cases, we will generally be involved on a secondary level and our OEM customer will be responsible for the license and approval process.
  
  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, and their derivatives. Pursuant to these requirements, we are required to report on Form SD the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. We strive to only use suppliers that source from conflict-free smelters and refiners; however, in the future, we may face difficulties in gathering information regarding our suppliers and the source of any such conflict minerals.
  
  New Product Development
  
  In recent years, our new product development efforts have been focused on the development of our capabilities in molded aspheric lenses and infrared lenses. We incurred expenditures for new product development during fiscal 2019 and 2018 of approximately $2.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively. In fiscal 2019 and 2018, our efforts were concentrated on expanding our product capabilities for molded optics and thermal imaging optics, to continue increasing our product offerings, and lower costs within our PMO and infrared product groups.
  
  In fiscal 2020, we anticipate focusing our new product development efforts on infrared optics products for imaging and sensing, fiber lasers, spectrophotometry, defense, medical devices, industrial, optical data storage, machine vision, sensors, and environmental monitoring. We currently plan to expend approximately between 5% and 6% of revenue for new product development during fiscal 2020, which could vary depending upon revenue levels, customer requirements, and perceived market opportunities.
  
  For more difficult or customized products, we typically bill our customers for engineering services as a non-recurring engineering fee.

  Concentration of Customer Risk
  
  In fiscal 2019, we had sales to three customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 32% of our annual revenue with one customer at 17% of our sales, another customer at 8% of our sales, and the third customer at 7% of our sales. In fiscal 2018, we had sales to three customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 28% of our annual revenue, with one customer at 16% of our sales, another customer at 7% of our sales, and the third customer at 5% of our sales. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any such customer, would adversely affect our revenues and profits. We continue to diversify our business in order to minimize our sales concentration risk.
  
  In fiscal 2019, 62% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside of the U.S., with 94% of our foreign sales derived from customers in Europe and Asia. In fiscal 2018, 58% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside of the U.S., with 84% of our foreign sales derived from customers in Europe and Asia.
  
  Employees
  
  As of June 30, 2019, we had 350 employees, of which 339 were full-time equivalent employees, with 97 in the U.S., including 93 located in Orlando, Florida and 4 working remotely from various locations, 98 located in Riga, Latvia, and 144 located in Jiading and Zhenjiang, China. Of our 339 full-time equivalent employees, we have 40 employees engaged in management, administrative, and clerical functions, 29 employees in new product development, 17 employees in sales and marketing, and 253 employees in production and quality control functions. Any employee additions or terminations over the next twelve months will be dependent upon the actual sales levels realized during fiscal 2020. We have used and will continue utilizing part-time help, including interns, temporary employment agencies, and outside consultants, where appropriate, to qualify prospective employees and to ramp up production as required from time to time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
