Non-controlling interests represent the earnings of Best Partners Mortgage Cooperative, Inc., doing business as Lenders One® (“Lenders One”). Lenders One is a mortgage cooperative managed, but not owned, by Altisource. Lenders One is included in revenue and reduced from net income to arrive at net income attributable to Altisource.

Customers
Overview
Our customers include some of the largest financial institutions in the United States, government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), utility companies, commercial banks, servicers, investors, non-bank originators and correspondent lenders, mortgage bankers, insurance companies and financial services companies. We also serve consumers through our Owners.com business.
Customer Concentration
Ocwen
Ocwen is a residential mortgage loan servicer of mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) it owns, including those MSRs in which others have an economic interest, and a subservicer of MSRs owned by others.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, Ocwen was our largest customer, accounting for 52% of our total revenue. Ocwen purchases certain mortgage services and technology services from us under the terms of services agreements and amendments thereto (collectively, the “Ocwen Services Agreements”) with terms extending through August 2025. Certain of the Ocwen Services Agreements contain a “most favored nation” provision and also grant the parties the right to renegotiate pricing, among other things.
Revenue from Ocwen primarily consists of revenue earned from the loan portfolios serviced and subserviced by Ocwen when Ocwen engages us as the service provider, and revenue earned directly from Ocwen, pursuant to the Ocwen Services Agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized revenue from Ocwen of $437.4 million, $542.0 million and $561.9 million, respectively. Revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of segment and consolidated revenue was as follows for the years ended December 31:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Mortgage Market | 63 | % | | 67 | % | 65 | %
Real Estate Market | 1 | % | | 1 | % | — | %
Other Businesses, Corporate and Eliminations | 9 | % | | 11 | % | 27 | %
Consolidated revenue | 52 | % | | 58 | % | 56 | %

We earn additional revenue related to the portfolios serviced and subserviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen or the MSR owner selects Altisource as the service provider. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized revenue of $47.1 million, $148.5 million and $188.0 million, respectively, related to the portfolios serviced by Ocwen when a party other than Ocwen or the MSR owner selected Altisource as the service provider. These amounts are not included in deriving revenue from Ocwen as a percentage of revenue in the table above.
As of December 31, 2018, accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled $15.2 million, $11.6 million of which was billed and $3.6 million of which was unbilled. As of December 31, 2017, accounts receivable from Ocwen totaled $18.9 million, $13.6 million of which was billed and $5.3 million of which was unbilled.
As of February 22, 2019, Altisource and Ocwen entered into agreements that, among other things, facilitate Ocwen’s transition from REALServicing and related technologies to another mortgage servicing software platform, establish a process for Ocwen to review and approve the assignment of one or more of our agreements to potential buyers of Altisource’s business lines, permit Ocwen to use service providers other than Altisource for up to 10% of referrals from certain portfolios (determined on a service-by-service basis), subject to certain restrictions, and affirms Altisource’s role as a strategic service provider to Ocwen through August 2025. We do not anticipate that a servicing technology transition would materially impact the other services we provide to Ocwen. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, service revenue from REALServicing and related technologies was $35.1 million, $37.2 million and $40.2 million, respectively.
NRZ
NRZ is a residential investment trust that invests in and manages residential mortgage related assets in the United States including MSRs and excess MSRs.
Ocwen has disclosed that NRZ is its largest client. As of September 30, 2018, NRZ owned MSRs or rights to MSRs relating to approximately 57% of loans serviced and subserviced by Ocwen (measured in unpaid principal balances (“UPB”)) (the “Subject MSRs”). In July 2017 and January 2018, Ocwen and NRZ entered into a series of agreements pursuant to which the parties agreed, 
6

among other things, to undertake certain actions to facilitate the transfer from Ocwen to NRZ of Ocwen’s legal title to the Subject MSRs and under which Ocwen will subservice mortgage loans underlying the Subject MSRs for an initial term of five years. 
On August 28, 2017, Altisource, through its licensed subsidiaries, entered into a Cooperative Brokerage Agreement, as amended, and related letter agreement (collectively, the “Brokerage Agreement”) with NRZ which extends through August 2025. Under this agreement and related amendments, Altisource remains the exclusive provider of brokerage services for REO associated with the Subject MSRs, irrespective of the subservicer, subject to certain limitations. NRZ’s brokerage subsidiary receives a cooperative brokerage commission on the sale of certain REO properties from these portfolios subject to certain exceptions.
The Brokerage Agreement can, at Altisource’s discretion, be terminated by Altisource, if a services agreement is not signed by Altisource and NRZ. The Brokerage Agreement may otherwise only be terminated upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Termination events include, but are not limited to, a breach of the terms of the Brokerage Agreement (including, without limitation, the failure to meet performance standards and non-compliance with law in a material respect), the failure to maintain licenses which failure materially prevents performance of the contract, regulatory allegations of non-compliance resulting in an adversarial proceeding against NRZ, voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, appointment of a receiver, disclosure in a Form 10-K or Form 10-Q that there is significant uncertainty about Altisource’s ability to continue as a going concern, failure to maintain a specified level of cash and an unapproved change of control. 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized revenue from NRZ of $28.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively, under the Brokerage Agreement (no comparative amount in 2016). For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized additional revenue of $83.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively, relating to the Subject MSRs when a party other than NRZ selects Altisource as the service provider (no comparative amount in 2016).
On August 28, 2017, Altisource and NRZ also entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent, as amended, to enter into a services agreement (the “Services LOI”), setting forth the terms pursuant to which Altisource would remain the exclusive service provider of fee-based services for the Subject MSRs, irrespective of the subservicer, through August 2025. The Services LOI expired on December 15, 2018. Altisource is providing services on the Subject MSRs pursuant to its agreements with Ocwen.
Other
Our services are provided to customers primarily located in the United States. Financial information for our segments can be found in Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements.
Sales and Marketing 
Our enterprise sales and marketing team and business unit sales executives have extensive relationship management and industry experience. These individuals cultivate and maintain relationships throughout the industry sectors we serve. We sell our suite of services to mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use and financial services firms.
Our primary sales and marketing focus areas for institutional customers are to:

• | Expand relationships with existing customers by cross-selling additional services and growing the volume of existing services we provide. We believe our customer relationships represent meaningful growth opportunities for us; 


• | Develop new customer relationships leveraging a comprehensive suite of services, strong performance and controls. We believe there is a large opportunity to provide our services to potential customers; and 


• | Sell new offerings to existing customers and prospects. Some of our newer offerings include our suite of support services for Federal Housing Administration mortgages, Vendorly™, a SaaS-based vendor management platform, Trelix end‑to‑end fulfillment services offering, and residential and commercial loan disbursement processing, risk mitigation and construction inspection services. 

Our primary sales and marketing focus areas for consumers are to:

• | Attract home buyers and sellers to Owners.com and Hubzu.com with a compelling value proposition through online marketing, search engine optimization and public relations; and


• | Leverage local real estate agents to provide personalized service to existing and prospective customers.

Given the highly regulated nature of the industries that we serve and the comprehensive purchasing process that our institutional customers and prospects follow, the time and effort we spend in expanding relationships or winning new relationships is significant. For example, it can often take more than one year from the request for proposal or qualified lead stage to the selection of Altisource as a service provider. Furthermore, following the selection of Altisource, it is not unusual for it to take an additional six to twelve months or more to negotiate the services agreement(s), complete the implementation procedures and begin receiving referrals.

Intellectual Property and Data 
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, trademarks and copyrights to establish and protect our trade secrets, intellectual property, software, technology and expertise. We also own or, as necessary and appropriate, have obtained licenses from third parties to intellectual property relating to our services, processes and businesses. These intellectual property rights are important factors in the success of our businesses.
As of December 31, 2018, we have been awarded one patent that expires in 2023, two patents that expire in 2024, eight patents that expire in 2025, three patents that expire in 2026, two patents that expire in 2027, two patents that expire in 2029, one patent that expires in 2030 and one patent that expires in 2036. In addition, we have registered trademarks, or recently filed applications for the registration of trademarks, in a number of jurisdictions including the United States, the European Union (“EU”), India and nine other jurisdictions. These trademarks generally can be renewed indefinitely, provided they are being used in commerce.
We actively protect our rights and intend to continue our policy of taking the measures we deem reasonable and necessary to develop and protect our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights.
In addition, we may make use of data in connection with certain of our services. This data generally relates to mortgage information, real property information and consumer information. We gather this data from a variety of third party sources, including from governmental entities and, subject to licensed usage rights, we use this data in connection with the delivery of our services, including combining it with proprietary data we generate to further enhance data and metrics in connection with our services.
Market and Competition
We sell our suite of services to mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use and financial services firms. The mortgage and real estate markets are very large and are influenced by macroeconomic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, home prices, inflation, unemployment rates and consumer confidence.
The markets to provide services for mortgage servicers and mortgage originators are highly competitive and generally consist of national companies, in-house providers and a large number of regional and local providers. We typically compete based upon product and service awareness and offerings, product and service delivery, quality and control environment, technology integration and support, price and financial strength.
The markets to provide services for buyers and sellers of homes for personal and investment use are highly competitive and generally consist of several national companies, a large number of regional and local providers and start-up companies. We typically compete based upon product and service awareness and offerings, product and service delivery, ease of transacting, price and personal service.
For financial services firms, we provide collection services and customer relationship management services. The markets to provide these services are highly competitive and generally consist of several national companies, a large number of regional and local providers and in-house providers. We typically compete based upon product and service awareness and offerings, product and service delivery, quality and control environment, technology integration and support, price and financial strength.
Our competitors may have greater financial resources, brand recognition, alternative or disruptive products and other competitive advantages. We cannot determine our market share with certainty, but believe for mortgage servicers and collection services for financial services firms, we have a modest share of the market, and for the others we have relatively small market share.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had the following number of employees:

 | United States | India | | Philippines | Uruguay | Luxembourg | | Consolidated Altisource
Mortgage Market | 592 | | 2,093 | | 125 | | 7 | | 1 | 2,818
Real Estate Market | 103 | | 110 | | 85 | | 1 | | 6 | 305 
Other Businesses, Corporate and Eliminations | 493 | | 1,903 | | 473 | | 122 | | 14 | 3,005
Total employees | 1,188 | | 4,106 | | 683 | | 130 | | 21 | 6,128

8

We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with employees to be good. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our continuing ability to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel.
Seasonality
Certain of our revenues are impacted by seasonality. Specifically, revenues from property sales, loan originations and certain property preservation services typically tend to be at their lowest level during the fall and winter months and at their highest level during the spring and summer months. In addition, the asset recovery management business typically tends to be higher in the first quarter, as borrowers may utilize tax refunds and bonuses to pay debts, and generally declines throughout the remainder of the year.
Government Regulation
Our business and the business of our customers are or may be subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities including the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), various federal and state banking, financial and consumer regulators and the state and local agencies that license or oversee certain of our auction, real estate brokerage, mortgage and debt collection services, trustee services, property management services and insurance services. We also must comply with a number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others:

• | the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”);


• | the California Homeowner Bill of Rights (“CHBR”);


• | the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act (“CAN-SPAM”);


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”);


• | the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (“FACTA”);


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”);


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”);


• | the Fair Housing Act;


• | the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”);


• | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”);


• | the Home Affordable Refinance Program (“HARP”);


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”);


• | the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (“HOEPA”);


• | the New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (“RPAPL”);


• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”);


• | the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing (“SAFE”) Act;


• | the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (“SCRA”);


• | the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”);


• | the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”); and


• | Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices statutes (“UDAAP”).

We are also subject to the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and comparable foreign laws, due to our activities in foreign jurisdictions.
In addition to federal and state laws regarding privacy and data security, we are also subject to data protection laws in the countries in which we operate. Additionally, certain of our entities are or may be subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
Legal requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated or amended. One such enacted regulation is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive and includes reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as the regulation of derivatives, capital market activities and consumer financial services. The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created the CFPB, a federal entity responsible for regulating consumer financial services and products. Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act contains the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (“Mortgage Act”). The Mortgage Act imposes a number of additional requirements on lenders and servicers of residential mortgage loans by amending and expanding certain existing regulations. The interpretation or enforcement by regulatory authorities of applicable laws and regulations also may change over time. In addition, the creation of new regulatory authorities or changes in the regulatory authorities overseeing applicable laws and regulations may also result in changing interpretation or enforcement of such laws or regulations.
9

Our failure or the failure of our customers or vendors to comply with applicable laws or regulations or changing interpretation of such laws or regulations could subject the Company to criminal or civil liability, significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs and consent orders affecting us or our customers that may curtail or restrict the business as it is currently conducted and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Furthermore, certain of our services are provided at the direction of, and pursuant to, the identified requirements of our customers. The failure of our customers to properly identify or account for regulatory requirements applicable to such services could expose us to significant penalties, fines, settlements, costs and consent orders that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
We may be subject to licensing and regulation as a provider of certain services including, among others, services as a mortgage origination underwriter, mortgage broker, valuation provider, appraisal management company, asset manager, property manager, property renovator, property lessor, title insurance agent, insurance broker and underwriter, real estate broker, auctioneer, foreclosure trustee and debt collector in a number of jurisdictions. Our employees and subsidiaries may be required to be licensed by or registered with various jurisdictions for the particular type of service sold or provided and to participate in regular continuing education programs. Periodically, we are subject to audits, examinations and investigations by federal, state and local governmental authorities and receive subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other requests for information from such governmental authorities in connection with their regulatory or investigative authority. Due to the inherent uncertainty of such actions, it is often difficult to predict the potential outcome or estimate any potential financial impact in connection with any such inquiries.
