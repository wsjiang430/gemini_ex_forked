Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview. Teradata Corporation ("we," "us," "Teradata," or the "Company") is a leading hybrid cloud analytics software provider focusing on delivering pervasive data intelligence to our customers, which we define as the ability to leverage 100% of a company’s data to uncover real-time intelligence, at scale. Teradata has broadened its market opportunity by evolving from an enterprise database company to an enterprise analytics platform provider where we help customers integrate and simplify their analytics ecosystem, access and manage data, and use analytics to extract answers and derive business value from data. Our target market is what we call "megadata" companies - those companies that we believe are the world's most demanding, large-scale, users of data and that have mission-critical, complex, and large-scale environments and require an integrated analytical solution that can accommodate massive scale and speed across secure, hybrid-cloud architectures. These megadata companies face significant challenges, including siloed data and conflicting and duplicative solutions, that can result in considerable expense to maintain and to manage the complexity. Megadata companies have invested heavily in technology, people, and infrastructure to support analytics technology that is typically extremely complex and often does not allow their employees access to the data they need to be efficient at their jobs. In addition, megadata companies are generally experiencing a dramatic increase in data due to the digital revolution and an increase in the complexity, cost, and risk associated with managing the large numbers of data silos across heterogeneous environments. Our view is that this trend is driving the need for these companies to integrate and simplify their analytical ecosystems while using

data to find answers to their toughest business challenges. As a result, we believe that the market for our solutions and services with megadata companies is large and growing. 
Our solution, Teradata Vantage™, is our new analytics platform that provides pervasive data intelligence. It connects multiple sources of data for ecosystem simplification and delivers massive scale and integration. Teradata Vantage is a highly scalable, secure, highly concurrent, and resilient analytics platform that addresses the challenges that megadata companies face by offering full integration of their datasets, tools, analytics languages, functions, and engines in one platform, which enables them to reduce complexity, risk, and costs. Teradata Vantage incorporates leading commercial and open source technologies including our market-leading integrated data warehouse engine, and it is available on-premises or in the cloud, both of which we believe are required by megadata companies to provide them flexibility and choice to de-risk their investments. Teradata has also made it easier for customers to work with the Company and purchase Teradata's solutions via subscription-based transactions.
Our solutions and services comprise software, hardware, and related business consulting and support services. We work with our customers to enable them to optimize the value of their data and analytics to get answers to their toughest business challenges and drive business outcomes, which can include, among other things:

• | Improving customer experience and profitability by understanding behavior patterns,


• | Improving operational efficiency,


• | Driving financial transformation with accurate and timely data, and


• | Creating more efficient utilization of assets through machine learning of sensor data.

Our business consulting services include a broad range of offerings, including consulting to help organizations establish an analytic vision, identify and operationalize analytical opportunities, enable an analytical ecosystem architecture, and ensure their analytical infrastructure delivers value. We also offer support and maintenance services for our offerings.
Teradata operates from numerous locations within the United States with the primary locations being San Diego, California, and Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, we have sales, services, research and development, and administrative offices located in 40 countries.
For the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, we had total revenues of $2.164 billion, of which approximately 52% was derived from the Americas region (North America and Latin America) and 48% from the International region (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan). For financial information about our segments and geographic information, see “Note 13-Segment, Other Supplemental Information and Concentrations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report.
History. Teradata started in a garage in Brentwood, California, and was incorporated in 1979 as a Delaware corporation, driven by the need for robust computing power to harness the value of aggregated data. In 1984, Teradata established a massively parallel relational database management system that enabled companies to easily scale their data management needs, revolutionizing data analysis for customers. In 1991, Teradata was acquired and operated as a division of another company until it was spun off as an independent, publicly-traded company called Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC) on September 30, 2007.
Industry and Market Opportunity. Our view is that analytics is and will continue to be a management priority for leading companies. We also believe that companies have seen a significant increase of data, and that the complexity, cost, and risk associated with managing large numbers of data silos has driven the need for companies to simplify and reduce such complexity. This is particularly true for megadata companies, and we believe that these companies require tightly integrated solutions that can accommodate massive scale and speed.
We believe Teradata’s strategy positions us to address this large market opportunity within the multi-billion dollar and growing data management and analytics markets. Our top opportunities are with megadata companies and we believe our hybrid cloud analytics software solution will lead to reduced risk and costs for these companies while enabling answers to many of their most difficult business challenges and driving business outcomes for them. We also believe these companies need help designing and implementing the right analytical ecosystem for their needs. We have tailored Teradata's offerings to meet the analytical needs of these megadata companies and to help them navigate the various alternatives for deployment across secure, hybrid-cloud architectures to provide flexibility and choice, which allows them to de-risk their investments.

Our Strategy. Teradata’s strategy is based on our mission of transforming how businesses work and people live through the power of data. Our strategy is to provide a differentiated set of offerings to the megadata target market through a portfolio of data and analytic solutions. We believe that this unique portfolio helps our customers simplify the complexity of their analytic ecosystems to reduce risk and costs and drive better answers for increased business value. We deliver pervasive data intelligence to help companies rise above the complexity, cost, and inadequacy of today’s analytic landscape, and we believe that we are uniquely positioned to deliver pervasive data intelligence for megadata companies with our Teradata Vantage analytical platform.
Our strategic objectives are to:

• | Relentlessly focus on consumption, focusing the entire company on annual recurring revenue ("ARR") growth;


• | Radically simplify, making Teradata's offerings easy to consume through improvements to the customer experience;


• | Pivot towards as-a-service, shifting from consulting first to as-a-service first;


• | Transform our go-to-market and brand, realigning our go-to-market organization and consulting resources to align with our strategy and megadata target market, and repositioning Teradata with our customers and the broader market; and


• | Deliver operational excellence through improved efficiency and execution across the organization.

A foundational element of this strategy and the Teradata Vantage analytical platform is Teradata EverywhereTM that brings together our offerings across cloud and on-premises deployments with flexible pricing and licensing models to de-risk customer purchase decisions. 
Through Teradata Everywhere, customers can:

• | Analyze Anything - enables analytic users throughout the organization to use their preferred analytic tools and engines across data sources, at scale.


• | Deploy Anywhere - provides analytic processing in the cloud and on-premises, providing flexibility to change as business needs evolve.


• | Buy Any Way - allows companies choice in how they want to consume our solutions through a variety of purchase options at different price points.


• | Move Anytime - includes software license portability when purchased via subscription that provides the flexibility to run analytics and move the software as needed across deployment options, such as moving from on-premises to cloud, between clouds, or from cloud to on-premises.

We have significantly expanded and built upon our integrated data warehouse engine and Teradata Everywhere to deliver our market-leading Teradata Vantage analytical platform. As described above, Teradata Vantage offers full data integration with multiple tools and languages, leading analytic engines, and new sources of data to deliver analytics. Teradata Vantage is available on-premises or through our "as-a-service" offering, Teradata IntelliCloudTM, where we manage the software and infrastructure for our customers, so they can focus on successful business outcomes. This includes the management of performance, security, availability, and operations, all delivered with various purchase options including a "pay-as-you-go" pricing model. Teradata IntelliCloud can be deployed on-premises, in private clouds, and in public clouds.
In support of our strategy, we continue to optimize our go-to-market and sales approach to improve effectiveness in demand creation and address new and expanded market opportunities. We will continue investing in partnerships to increase the number of solutions available on Teradata software, maximize customer value, and increase our market coverage. Our architecture consulting expertise, helps customers build optimized analytical ecosystems, leveraging both open-source and commercial solutions, which leads to reduced complexity, risk, and costs for our customers.
Customers. As described above, Teradata is focused on both business users and technology buyers at megadata companies (i.e., the world’s most demanding, large-scale users of data) as well as strategic “up-and-coming” companies that see analytics as a differentiating factor in their business models. Our primary focus is on increasing the consumption of Teradata's software within our target market of megadata customers, especially with our existing customers.

We are focused on a broad set of industries, including communications, financial services, government, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing, media and entertainment, oil and gas, retail, travel and transportation, and utilities. These industries provide a good fit for our analytic solutions and services because they tend to have the greatest analytic potential with large and growing data volumes and expanding sources of data, complex data management requirements, or large and varied groups of users.
The extent to which any given customer contributes to our revenues has historically varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter. However, we have been successfully converting customers from perpetual to subscription-based purchasing options, which results in more ratable revenue recognition and will increase the predictability of our revenue in the future. Prior to our conversion to subscription-based transactions, our results in any quarter have been dependent on our ability to generate a relatively small number of large orders for that quarter. Due to the size and complexity of our sales transactions, the sales cycle is often long (typically more than a year).
Seasonality. Historically, our deal volume is seasonal, in line with customer spending patterns, with lower volume typically in the first quarter and higher volume generally in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Such seasonality causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume, timing, and mix of solution sales. As we continue to transition the business to more subscription-based transactions, this variability in deal volume will have less effect on reported revenue and cash collections and will reduce the impact of seasonality. Historically, cash provided by operating activities is higher in the first half of the year due to collections of the higher receivable balances at December 31 driven by the higher volumes in the fourth quarter and receipts from annual renewals of our maintenance support agreements. In addition, deal volume in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months. These factors, among others as more fully described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results.
Backlog. Our backlog was approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2018 an increase from $1.6 billion on December 31, 2017. Approximately $1.2 billion of the backlog at December 31, 2018 is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2019. Backlog includes firm contracts for work that has not yet been performed or goods that have not been delivered. Backlog includes $595 million at December 31, 2018 and $499 million at December 31, 2017 for backlog that had been invoiced, and therefore, was included in deferred revenue. Although we believe that the contract value included in backlog is firm, some contracts may provide that the Company is contractually obligated to perform but gives the customer the right to cancel for convenience by giving notice to Teradata. Customers typically do not cancel before the end of the contractual term and, historically, Teradata has seen very little churn in its customer base. 
Sales, Marketing and Partners
Sales and Marketing. We primarily sell and market our solutions and services through a direct sales force and have recently aligned our sales teams to best address the needs of megadata companies globally. We have approximately 80% of our employees in customer-facing and/or revenue-driving roles (including sales, marketing, consulting, customer service, and product engineering).
We support our sales force with marketing and training programs that are designed to:

• | Grow awareness, highlighting our technology leadership, differentiation, and consulting expertise;


• | Create demand for and adoption of our Teradata Vantage analytical platform;


• | Educate the sales force to build skills and knowledge to deliver our value proposition; and


• | Provide a robust set of tools for use by our direct sales force.

In 2018, Teradata announced major updates to our brand messaging, revitalizing our positioning in the market. This new messaging reinforces that Teradata is a hybrid cloud analytics software provider. To support this updated brand messaging, we employ a broad range of marketing strategies, including programs to inform and educate customers and prospects, the media, industry analysts, academics, and other third-party influencers. These strategies include targeted account-based marketing, our global website, digital marketing, webinars, physical and virtual trade shows and conferences, public and media relations, social media, and an extensive customer reference program.

Strategic Partnerships. We seek to leverage our sales and marketing reach by partnering with leading global and regional systems integrators, independent software vendors, open-source software distributors, consultants, and universities that we believe complement our analytic offerings. Strategic partnerships are a key factor in our ability to leverage the value and expand the scope of our analytic offerings in the marketplace.

• | Alliance Partners: Our partner program is focused on working collaboratively with independent software vendors in several areas, including tools, data and application integration solutions, data mining, analytics, business intelligence, and specific analytic and industry solutions. Our goal is to provide choices to our customers with partner offerings that are optimized and certified to work with Teradata Vantage to deliver end-to-end analytic and data solutions and to fit within the customer’s analytic environment.


• | Systems Integrators: In some cases, we also work with a range of systems integrators and consultants who engage in the design, implementation, and integration of analytic solutions and analytic applications for our joint customers. Our strategic partnerships with select global consulting and systems integration firms provide broad industry and technology expertise in the design of business solutions that leverage Teradata technology to enable enterprise analytics.

Competition. We successfully compete in a large and growing market that is attractive to both current and new competitors. Participants in our general market include large traditional competitors such as IBM, Oracle, SAP, Amazon and Microsoft as well as new analytic services companies, cloud vendors, and open-source providers. We believe our focus on ecosystem simplification and on delivering answers and business outcomes will enable us to successfully compete in our megadata target market. We believe that our Vantage platform is highly differentiated, delivers significant value at scale, and is uniquely positioned to provide significant business value to megadata customers. This, coupled with our ability to deploy across cloud and on-premises options with flexible purchasing and licensing options, provides our customers with the ability to de-risk their buying decisions. Our consulting capabilities deliver value to our customers, enabling them to be successful in their markets, while also identifying incremental use cases that increase customers' consumption of Teradata's software. We believe that our technology, purchasing flexibility, and consulting will collectively enable us to continue to compete successfully. For more information on competition, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Key factors used to evaluate competitors in these markets include: data and analytics experience; business outcome delivery; hybrid cloud offerings and experience; customer references; technology leadership; product quality; performance, scalability, availability, and manageability; support and consulting services capabilities; management of technologies in a complex analytical ecosystem; industry knowledge; and total cost of ownership. We believe we have a competitive advantage in providing complete, integrated, and optimized analytic data platforms and analytic services that address customers’ business, technical, and architecture requirements. Our differentiation is especially strong with megadata customers that have mission-critical, complex, large-scale environments and requirements.
Research and Development ("R&D"). We remain focused on designing and developing data and analytic technologies that anticipate our customers' evolving needs and deliver the answers that advance their businesses. As we seek improvements in our offerings and services, we consider our customers' current and future needs. We believe our extensive R&D workforce is one of our core strengths. Our global R&D team is in multiple locations around the world to take advantage of global engineering talent. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures, which may include complementary strategic acquisitions, to help support the flow of innovative, high-quality offerings, cloud-based offerings, services, and applications, which are vital to our leading competitive position. For information regarding the accounting and costs included in R&D activities, see “Note 1-Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Intellectual Property and Technology. The Company owns 662 patents in the United States and 29 patents in foreign countries. The foreign patents are generally counterparts of the Company’s United States patents. Many of the patents that we own are licensed to others, and we are licensed to use certain patents owned by others. While our portfolio of patents and patent applications in aggregate is of significant value to our Company, we do not believe that any individual patent is by itself of material importance to our business.
In addition, the Company owns copyrights and trade secrets in its vast code base which makes up all of the Teradata software offerings including analytic data platforms and analytic applications. Teradata’s software offerings reflect the investment of hundreds of person-years of development work.
8

The source code versions of our offerings are protected as trade secrets and, in all major markets, as unpublished copyright works. We take great efforts to protect our rights in all software offerings and related intellectual property; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. The Company owns the Teradata® and Aster® trademarks, which are registered in the United States and in many foreign countries, as well as other trade names, service marks, and trademarks.
Sources of Materials. Our hardware components are assembled and configured by Flex Ltd. (“Flex”). Our platform line is designed to leverage the components from industry leaders. Our data storage devices and memory components utilize industry-standard technologies but are selected and configured to work optimally with our software and hardware platform. Flex also procures a wide variety of components used in the assembly process on our behalf. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources, Teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality, cost and delivery. Typically, these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes and/or facilities to ensure business continuity of supply. Given our strategy to outsource product assembly activities to Flex and to source certain components from single suppliers, a disruption in production at Flex or at a supplier, or a global shortage of components, could impact the timing or profitability of customer shipments. In addition, a significant change in the forecasts to any of these preferred suppliers could result in purchase obligations for components that may be in excess of demand.
Employees. As of December 31, 2018, we had 10,152 employees globally. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel. 
Properties and Facilities. Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 101 facilities in 41 countries throughout the world. We own our San Diego complex, while all other facilities are leased.
