Organizational History 
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary LifeApps, Inc., we are a licensed developer and publisher of apps for the Apple Apps Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. We are also a licensed developer on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. We have distributed apps on all three platforms. We are currently not targeting our revenue strategy on further development of additional apps or updating or expanding on apps that we have developed but, will instead, make our primary focus the development and operation of various new business operations that we intend to establish. As set forth below, on January 25, 2019, we acquired LGBT Loyalty LLC and intend to create a LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index (the “Index”) that will provide the LGBT community with the power to influence the allocation of capital within the Index based upon their consumer preferences. The Index is intended to link the economic power of the LGBTQ community with many of the top companies that support and market their products to the LGBTQ demographic. We also plan to create ancillary businesses that are intended to complement and support the Index including LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship which will be established to promote the Index along with the companies from around the world that desire to market and advertise directly to LGBTQ consumers. We intend to join forces with some of the most recognizable LGBTQ community leaders from around the world and have them become LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship members. The LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship is expected to incorporate marketing and support of the companies included in the Index. All companies will be offered the opportunity to purchase LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship packages. We also plan to develop a digital media network that will specialize in targeting highly sought-after niche demographic audiences. In that regard, we intend to focus on two core businesses, an LGBTQ Advertising Network and an LGBTQ Media Network. Through our digital platform, we expect to aggregate content from around the world. We also intend to create original content along with sponsored content in a 24/7 digital network. The LGBTQ Advertising Network is intended to assist brands in global targeting of the LGBTQ demographic. The LGBTQ Advertising Network is expected to provide advertisers and brands with over 300 mainstream digital platforms and access to this loyal, affluent and ever-expanding audience. We intend to deliver to our audience relevant sponsored content marketing message across all spectrums of digitally connected devices. We believe that our unique value proposition to our audience and sponsors will be the ability to deliver aggregated and original content, with emphasis on interactive content and captive video.
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware as Prime Time Travel, Inc. on November 23, 2010, for the purpose of creating and managing trips to destination locations for youth basketball teams. On August 23, 2012, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to, among other things, change our name from Prime Time Travel, Inc. to LifeApps Digital Media Inc., and increase our authorized capitalization to 310,000,000 shares, consisting of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.
 
On September 5, 2012, we effected a 15-for-1 forward stock split in the form of a dividend to holders of our common stock as of record on September 4, 2012.
 
On September 20, 2012, LifeApps Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary of ours, merged with and into LifeApps Inc., which had been organized as a California limited liability company on July 13, 2009, and was converted to a Nevada corporation on September 7, 2012 in anticipation of the merger. In connection with the merger, each share of LifeApps common stock was cancelled and converted into the right to receive 400 shares of our common stock. LifeApps was the surviving corporation of that merger. As a result of the merger, we acquired the business of LifeApps. Immediately following the merger, we split off our wholly owned subsidiary, Prime Time Split Corp., a Delaware corporation, through the exchange of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Split Corp. All of our assets and liabilities immediately following the merger, excluding any assets and liabilities assumed in the merger, were transferred to Split Corp.
 
On December 31, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to (i) change our corporate name to LifeApps Brands Inc., (ii) effect a one-for-fifteen (1:15) reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and (iii) increase our authorized capitalization from 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Reverse Split and Name Change took effect on OTC Markets at the commencement of business on January 7, 2016, at which time our common stock began trading on a post-reverse split basis.

On January 24, 2019 we filed a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the Delaware Secretary of State to create a series of preferred stock designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) consisting of one share. The share of Series A Preferred Stock was issued to Maxim Partners, LLC, a New York limited liability company (“Maxim”) in connection with the January 25, 2019 Securities Exchange Agreement described below. The Series A Preferred Stock has no voting, liquidation or other rights other than the right to convert into common stock. The Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into additional shares of our restricted common stock immediately after such time that (i) the number of shares of our authorized common stock is increased from 500,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 shares (the “Share Increase”); and (ii) the January 25, 2019 warrants issued to Brian Neal, our President, and Robert Gayman, our former Executive Management Consultant, at the closing of the securities exchange transaction described below (the “Management Warrants”) are automatically exercised for shares of our restricted common stock. The Management Warrants represent common stock purchase warrants that were issuable to Robert Blair, our Chief Executive Officer, Brian Neal and Robert Gayman, and/or their designees or assignees (collectively, the “Management Holders”) in exchange for the cancellation of all amounts due to the Management Holders by us as of, but not including, January 1, 2019, which amounts consisted solely of accrued salaries and /or consulting fees earned by the Management Holders through December 31, 2018, plus interest due thereon. These amounts consisted of $161,629 due to Robert Blair, representing $154,600 of compensation and $7,029 of interest, $25,054 due to Brian Neal, representing $24,000 of compensation and $1,054 of interest and $161,629 due to Robert Gayman, representing $154,600 of compensation and $7,029 of interest. Prior to their issuance, Robert Blair gifted his right to receive Management Warrants to Brian Neal. The Management Warrants are automatically exercisable for shares of our restricted common stock following the Share Increase at an exercise price equal to a 10% discount to the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) for our common stock during the three trading days ending on the seventh trading day following the date on which this Current Report is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as otherwise provided below, the share of Series A Preferred Stock is automatically convertible into 99.98% of the number of shares issued upon the automatic exercise of the Management Warrants. However, upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, Maxim may not own more than 49.99% of our then issued and outstanding common stock. In the event that the full conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in Maxim owning more than 49.99% of our then issued and outstanding common stock, the conversion will be limited to such number of shares that will result in Maxim owning 49.99% of our then issued and outstanding common stock and the issuance of the remaining shares issuable upon conversion will be deferred until such time that their issuance will not increase Maxim ‘s ownership of our common stock to more than 49.99%.
 
On January 25, 2019, we entered into and closed a securities exchange under a Securities Exchange Agreement (the “Securities Exchange Agreement”) with LGBT Loyalty LLC, a New York limited liability company (“LGBT Loyalty”), and Maxim, pursuant to which we acquired all of the membership interests of LGBT Loyalty, making LGBT Loyalty a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, in exchange for 120,959,996 shares of our restricted common stock and one share of our newly created Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). The common stock issued to Maxim represented, upon issuance, 49.99% of our then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Effective March 26, 2019, the share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was converted into 8,598,578 shares of our common stock.
 
On March 26, 2019, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase our authorized capitalization from 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. As the result of the filing of the Certificate of Amendment, the Management Warrants were automatically exercised for 8,600,298 shares of our common stock and following such exercise the outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock was automatically converted into 8,598,578 shares of common stock.
 
On April 3, 2019 we filed a Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with the Delaware Secretary of State to create a new class of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”) and authorized the issuance of up to 1,500,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock has no voting, liquidation or other rights other than the right to receive dividends and to convert into common stock. The stated value of each share of Series B Convertible Preferred for purposes of conversions and dividends is $1.15 (the “Conversion/Dividend Stated Value”). The stated value of each share of Series B Convertible Preferred for purposes of redemptions is $1.35 (the “Redemption Stated Value”). Subject to earlier conversion or redemption, the Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into fully paid and non-accessible shares of our common stock 24 months following the date of issuance of such Series B Preferred Stock without any action or payment required on the part of the holder of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Subject to a floor price limitation of $0.03 per share, the automatic conversion price to which the Conversion/Dividend Stated Value will be applied will be the lower of (i) $0.10 per share of common stock; or (ii) a 20% discount to the lowest volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) for our common stock on our principal trading market during the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the automatic conversion date. Subject to earlier conversion or redemption, the Series B Preferred Stock will also automatically convert into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock upon the conversion terms provided above if (i) the closing sale price for our common stock on our principal trading market closes at or above $0.20 for 10 consecutive trading days;(ii) our common stock is uplisted to NASDAQ or a national securities exchange; or (iii) we complete an offering of securities resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of not less than $3,000,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the automatic conversion events set forth in (i), (ii) and (iii) above are not applicable during the 180 day period following the issuance date or if the common stock issuable upon conversion is not registered or subject to sale pursuant to Rule 144 or another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Commencing 180 days after the issuance date, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock will have the right to convert their Series B Convertible Preferred at any time into common stock on the same conversion terms applicable to automatic conversions. Absent the prior written approval of the Company, all automatic and optional conversions of Series B Preferred Stock must be for a minimum of 5,000 shares of Series B Preferred except in cases where the holder owns less than 5,000 shares and is converting all Series B Preferred shares then owned by the holder. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued upon conversions of the Series B Convertible Preferred. In lieu of any fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, we will round up to the next full share. Dividends at the rate of 12% per annum (1% per month) are payable on the Conversion/Dividend Stated Value of the Series B Preferred Stock in cash or stock at our discretion. Dividends are payable at the end of each month following the applicable issuance date. Dividends payable in stock will be calculated based on the 5-day VWAP during each of the last 5 trading days of the month for which payment is being made. To the extent that a month for which dividends are payable does not involve a full month because shares of Series B Preferred Stock were issued, redeemed, or converted during such month, the dividend payable shall be pro-rated to reflect the number of days of such month that the dividend applies to. In all events, dividends shall not be payable for periods following redemption, conversion or the 24 month anniversary of the applicable issuance date. The Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable in cash by us at any time prior to conversion upon five business days prior written notice to the holder at the Redemption Stated Value for each share being redeemed. The automatic and optional conversion price will be appropriately adjusted to reflect stock splits, stock dividends (exclusive of the dividends payable on the Series B Preferred Stock) business combinations and similar recapitalization.

Business Overview 
 
On January 25, 2019, we entered into and closed a Securities Exchange Agreement pursuant to which LGBT Loyalty became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Through LGBT Loyalty, we intend to create, establish, develop, manage and fund an LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index (the “Index”). The Index is expected to be the first “preference” index to survey a representative group of the LGBTQ community to determine which companies within the S&P 500 best support and are supported by the LGBTQ community. We have signed a Letter of Intent to partner with ProcureAM in the creation and development of the Index. ProcureAM will also advise as to the additional service providers for the Index including outside Index Counsel, Index Calculation Agent, Bank Custodian, PR Firm, Data Collection Agent, Index Data Compiler, Listing Agent, Public Auditor and Index Advisors. The LGBTQ demographic has proven itself to be a fiercely loyal consumer group supporting companies and their brands. In addition, we are developing a business model designed for businesses to promote and showcase their support for the LGBTQ community. We also plan to create additional businesses that will enhance the Index, including LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship which we intend to establish to promote the growth of the Index. We will pursue partnerships with socially conscious companies globally that seek to market and advertise directly to LGBTQ consumers. We also intend to partner with some of the most recognizable LGBTQ community leaders from around the world to have them become LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship members that will promote the Index. The LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship will incorporate marketing and support of the companies included in the Index. Companies within the Index will be given the opportunity to purchase LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship packages. Sponsorship packages will be tier priced starting at ten thousand dollars for a first level package and increasing to one million dollars for a gold level package. We plan to utilize the networking and relationships of our Board of Directors to promote the LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship packages. We also intend to focus on two complimentary businesses, an LGBTQ Advertising Network and an LGBTQ Media Network. The LGBTQ Advertising Network will offer a direct link to the companies that desire to deliver a customized marketing campaign to the LGBTQ consumer. We intend to offer our expertise including our own survey data to help companies develop their targeted message in a powerful delivery network. The LGBTQ Media Network will aggregate content from around the world in a 24/7 digital delivery format that is intended to target the highly desired spending power of the LGBTQ consumer.
 
In connection with the Securities Exchange Agreement and the closing thereunder, no changes were made to the composition of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) or executive officers. Accordingly, immediately following the closing, our Board continued to be comprised of Robert Blair and Lawrence Roan, and our executive officers continued to be comprised of Robert Blair (Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and Brian Neal (President). Effective March 8, 2019, we appointed Barney Frank and Billy Bean to our board. Effective March 25, 2019, we appointed Martina Navratilova to our board.
 
The Securities Exchange Agreement also provides that during the six month period following the January 25, 2019 closing under the Securities Exchange Agreement (i) we cannot enter into any financing transactions without the prior written consent of Maxim, which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) we cannot issue any equity or debt securities without the prior written consent of Maxim, which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld. As further provided in the Securities Exchange Agreement, since its formation, LGBT Loyalty has had no material operations, assets or liabilities.

We are a licensed developer and publisher of apps for the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. We are also a licensed developer on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. We have distributed apps/publications on all three platforms. Moving forward we will focus on the development of niche demographic media networks. Our management team has selected the LGBT marketplace as their first audience to target for the following reasons: the LGBT community is estimated to have four times the buying power of Hispanics and African Americans, two times the buying power of Asian Americans and four times the buying power of millennials, and they are extremely loyal and consistent consumers. At current growth rates, the purchasing power of the US LGBT community is estimated to exceed 1 trillion dollars by 2020. Currently, the LGBT audience is fragmented across multiple sites. We will target this audience directly with community specific content, blogs, stories and video. Currently there are an estimated 19.6 million people who identify themselves as LGBT in the US. They represent an estimated 890 billion dollars of buying power in the US and an estimated 3 trillion dollars globally. Same-sex households have an estimated 23% higher median income as compared to mainstream households. They are believed to be 1.23 times more likely to buy brands that reflect their style and they are believed to be 1.56 times more likely to consider themselves a spender rather than a saver. Our focus will be to aggregate the LGBT audience through a powerful database marketing platform.
 
We will continue to explore acquisitions of companies and new technologies. In addition, we will also explore the acquisition of consumer related products as well. Such acquisitions will be considered where the purchase can help increase our revenues or enable us to attain assets that will allow us to gain technological advances that would be more costly to develop than to purchase. 
 
Our Products
 
We intend to create a LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index. We will attempt to grow and publicize the Index through an LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship program. LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship packages will be offered to companies that support the LGBTQ community. We also intend to create a LGBTQ Advertising Network and a LGBTQ Media Network. The LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index will survey and select up to 100 of the most influential companies that support and market their products and services to LGBTQ consumers. Our LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorships and LGBTQ Membership Programs will be offered to all companies that express an interest in promoting their support for the LGBTQ community through marketing, hiring practices, charitable giving and other forms of support. The LGBTQ Advertising Network will deliver market specific messaging to this powerful consumer group and will be available to assist companies in tailoring their advertising for the greatest impact. The LGBTQ Media Network will attract viewers through breaking news and relevant content from the world of news, entertainment, sports, politics, travel and health and fitness. The LGBTQ Media Network will aggregate content from around the world in a 24/7 digital delivery format that is intended to target the highly desired spending power of the LGBTQ consumer. Subject to our receipt of required financing, we expect to launch our products during the fourth quarter of 2019.
Revenue 
 
We intend to monetize and drive revenue through development of the LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index. We will receive a percentage of the revenues derived from the Index. We expect the Index to reach the break-even point when its holdings of funds under management are approximately $40,000,000. We also intend to drive revenue through ancillary businesses that will support and be supported by the LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index. Our LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorships and LGBTQ Membership Programs are intended to produce revenue through direct sales of the offerings to companies who desire to be recognized as supportive of the LGBTQ community. The LGBTQ Advertising Network and LGBTQ Media Network are expected to drive revenue as a vehicle to market and advertise to the highly sought-after LGBTQ consumer demographic. 
Convertible Loans 
 
On November 9, 2015 an individual (the “Lender”) made an unsecured convertible loan to LifeApps Brands Inc. (the “Company”) due and payable on March 21, 2016, in the principal amount of $25,000 bearing interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The loan was evidenced in writing by the Company and the Lender when made and was convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) at a price of $0.75 per share. On October 27, 2016 the Company and the Lender entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement in which they agreed to revise the conversion price from $0.75 per share to $0.0055 per share, which was the closing sale price for the Common Stock on October 27, 2016 and to convert the principal amount of the loan at the revised conversion price into 4,545,455 shares of Common Stock. In consideration of the revised conversion terms, the Lender agreed to waive the accrued interest due on the loan.
 
During the period April 2, 2016 through August 7, 2017 the Lender made unsecured loans to us in the aggregate principal amount of $55,500. Effective December 19, 2017 the Lender converted $54,000 of the $55,500 in loan principal then owed to her by us, into 5,400,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.01 per share and forgave all interest accrued on the converted amount.

Effective December 19, 2017 Lawrence Roan, a director, converted $39,935 of the $41,500 in debt owed to him by us, into 3,993,500 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.01 per share and forgave the balance of the debt, including, all accrued interest due thereon. He also forgave all accrued interest due on the converted amount.
 
Effective March 6, 2018 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Power Up Lending Group Ltd. (“Power Up”) pursuant to which we issued to Power Up a $35,000 convertible promissory note dated March 6, 2018 (the “Power Up Note”). The Power Up Note entitled the holder to 12% interest per annum and had a maturity date of March 6, 2019. Power Up had the right to convert the Power Up Note into shares of our common stock beginning on the date which is 180 days from the issuance date of the Power Up Note, at a price equal to 58% of the lowest trading price for our common stock during the 15 trading day period ending on the last complete trading date prior to the date of conversion, provided, however, that Power Up could not convert the Power Up Note to the extent that such conversion would result in Power Up’s beneficial ownership being in excess of 4.99% of our issued and outstanding common stock together with all shares owned by Power Up and its affiliates at the time of conversion. The Securities Purchase Agreement contained a Right of First Refusal in favor of the Purchaser and the Note contained a Most Favored Nation provision in favor of the Holder. The Securities Purchase Agreement also subjected us to substantial penalties in the event of a default. As the result of our failure to timely file a periodic report, we were in default under the Power Up Note. As a result, the principal balance due on the Power Up Note was increased from $35,000 to $52,500 and we also incurred interest penalties. During the period September 20, 2018 through February 11, 2019, Power Up converted the principal and interest due on the Power Up Note into an aggregate of 33,481,522 shares at conversion prices ranging from $0.0045 to $0.0015 per share. Effective February 11, 2019, the Power Up Note has been fully converted and terminated.
 
On August 7, 2018 and December 19, 2018 we received loans of $10,000 and $5,000, respectively, from a lender. On March 7, 2019, the lender agreed to convert the $15,000 in loan principal into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.08 per share resulting in an issuance obligation of 187,500 shares. We have yet to issue the shares, but expect to issue them in the near future. The lender also agreed to waive all interest due on the loans.
 
Advisory/Consulting Agreements
 
Wellfleet Consulting Agreement
 
On January 8, 2018 we entered into a 90-day Consulting Agreement (the “Wellfleet Agreement”), effective as of January 1, 2018, with Wellfleet Partners, Inc. (“Wellfleet”) in recognition of past and future financial, management consulting and advisory and due diligence services provided and to be provided to us by Wellfleet. In consideration thereof, we paid Wellfleet $7,500 in cash and issued an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of our restricted common stock to two designees of Wellfleet.
Uptick Agreement
 
On January 26, 2018 we entered into an Advisory Agreement with Uptick Capital, LLC. (“Uptick”) pursuant to which Uptick provided us with marketing and financial advice. The Advisory Agreement had a term of 30 days. We issued 500,000 shares of our restricted common stock under the Advisory Agreement.
Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy will include worldwide promotion of the LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index. Findings from LGBTQ economic experts have highlighted the value of LGBTQ brand loyalty. More than an estimated seventy-five percent of LGBTQ adults and their friends, family, and relatives have said they would switch to brands that are known to be LGBTQ friendly.
 
LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship will be established to promote the Index along with the companies that market and advertise to LGBTQ consumers. We expect to join forces with some of the most recognizable individuals from around the world to become LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship Members and publicize the Index. The LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship will incorporate marketing and support of the companies included in the Index. Companies will be offered the opportunity to purchase LGBT Loyalty Sponsorship packages starting at ten-thousand dollars and up to one million dollars. All Sponsorship packages will include use of the LGBTQ Loyalty Logo and recognition on our Website Supporters page. More elaborate LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship packages will include access to our survey data, coordinated events with LGBTQ Loyalty Sponsorship Members, involvement in developing survey questions and recognition through press releases, photo opportunities and event media.

We are also in development of a LGBTQ Advertising Network and a LGBT Media Network to assist businesses and brands in the creation and distribution of specific content targeting the highly desired spending power of the LGBTQ consumer.
 
Our business strategy is targeted to the estimated three trillion-dollar global purchasing power of the LGBTQ consumer demographic. More than nineteen million people identify themselves as LGBTQ in the US and the LGBTQ community is composed of some of the most loyalty driven consumers in the world.
 
Many Fortune 500 companies have mandated diversity and equality as part of their annual marketing spend. Our mission is to become the worlds’ largest media and advertising network marketplace for connecting companies with LGBTQ consumers around the globe. Some of the companies currently advertising to the LGBTQ community include AT&T, Lexus, Procter & Gamble, American Airlines, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Burger King, Subaru, Orbitz, Miller-Coors, and HBO. The foremost desire for LGBTQ consumers is to see themselves more widely represented in all forms of advertising. In the US, 66 percent of LGBTQ consumers say that they don’t see their lifestyle represented enough in advertising. Data has estimated that LGBT consumers in the US, UK and Germany are more likely than the general public to act after seeing an advertisement. We intend to deliver sponsored advertising content through this network of the most popular mainstream entertainment websites covering News, Health & Fitness, Travel & Leisure, Business and Sports. We believe that our sponsored advertising content will inspire an authentic relationship between advertisers and consumers. These advertisers desire an authentic relationship with the LGBTQ community. We intend to not only help them create powerful content but we will make sure their content hits the consumer bullseye.
 
We believe that the LGBTQ demographic is one of the most highly sought-after economic groups in the world from corporate America down to the local business owner. What makes targeting and supporting this dynamic demographic even more extraordinary and rewarding is that friends, family, employers, employees, teachers, coaches and fans of our community so loyally support the brands, products and services that in turn support us. We further believe that this loyalty across the board is time tested, proven, growing and expanding and ultimately extremely rewarding to all that are embraced by the LGBTQ community.
 
We have achieved no revenues to date from our LGBT related operations and no assurance can be given that we will achieve revenues or profitability in the future.
 
Competition 
 
We believe that we are creating the first LGBTQ Loyalty Preference Index. We have identified Pride Performance & Holdings (“Pride”), an entity which gives individuals an opportunity to invest in companies that support equality in the workplace for their lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees as a competitor. However, Pride appears to focus mainly on the hiring of LGBT individuals and we do not see this as direct competition as our Index will be created through surveying and preferencing the top companies in the S&P 500 that best support the LGBTQ community. 
Government Regulation 
 
We are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in them being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.
 
Further, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of three employees, all of whom were full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Properties
 
Our principal executive office is located at 2435 Dixie Highway, Wilton Manors, Florida 33305 and our telephone number is (954) 947-6133. The property is currently being rented on a month to month basis at a rate of $250 per month.

Legal Proceedings
 
We may, from time to time, be a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations. Currently, no legal proceedings, government actions, administrative actions, investigations or claims are pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Available Information
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, including annual and quarterly reports, and other reports we file, can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
