ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
Logitech is a world leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing products that help connect people to digital and cloud experiences. More than 35 years ago, Logitech created products to improve experiences around the personal computer (PC) platform, and today it is a multi-brand, multi-category company designing products that enable better experiences consuming, sharing and creating digital content for computing, gaming, video and music, whether it is on a computer, mobile device or in the cloud. Logitech's brands include Logitech, Jaybird, Ultimate Ears, Logitech G, ASTRO Gaming and Blue Microphones.

Our worldwide channel network includes consumer electronics distributors, retailers, mass merchandisers, specialty stores, computer and telecommunications stores, value-added resellers and online merchants. 
Acquisitions
On August 21, 2018, we acquired all equity interests in Blue Microphones Holding Corporation (Blue Microphones) for a total consideration of $134.8 million in cash (the Blue Microphones Acquisition), which included a working capital adjustment and repayment of debt on behalf of Blue Microphones.

On August 11, 2017, we acquired certain assets and liabilities constituting the ASTRO Gaming business (ASTRO) from AG Acquisition Corporation for a purchase price of $85.0 million in cash (the ASTRO Acquisition). ASTRO is a leading console gaming accessory brand with a history of producing award-winning headsets for professional gamers and enthusiasts. ASTRO provides a strong growth platform in the console gaming accessories market.
Industry Overview
Historically, Logitech's business has been driven by the same trends that drove the adoption of desktop and laptop PCs for consumers, businesses and institutional applications, including the growth in affordable processing power, communications bandwidth, the increased accessibility of digital content, and the growing and pervasive use of the Internet for productivity, communication and entertainment. These trends have created opportunities for new applications, new users and dramatically richer interaction between people and digital content. 
In the last several years, new PC shipments have stagnated and, combined with increased interest in smaller, mobile computing devices (such as smartphones and tablets), the market for PC peripherals has rapidly changed. We see opportunities within the large installed base of PCs, created by consumers' desire to refresh their current PCs with new peripherals, as well as new trends developing within the connected device ecosystems. In addition, the refresh of operating systems and new use cases created by the growth of specific cloud-based services and applications drive new peripherals opportunities. Consumers are also enhancing their tablet experience with a range of keyboards and cases that enable them to create, consume and do more with their tablets conveniently and comfortably.
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K | 3

Growing adoption of cloud-based experiences in gaming, video, music and smart home has expanded our addressable market opportunities. More and more consumers today interact with cloud-based content platforms, such as Steam and Twitch for gaming, Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora for streaming music, or Zoom or Microsoft Teams for video collaboration. Logitech offers peripherals and accessories to enhance the use of such cloud-based content platforms. 
In the gaming market, the rapid rise of electronic sports (esports), and the development of new technologies in social, virtual and augmented reality present growth opportunities. We leverage our deep research and development (R&D) capabilities in the area of PC peripherals to develop industry-leading gaming gear that enhances consumers' overall gaming experience and performance. As consumers increasingly watch various esports tournaments or other gaming broadcasts on cloud-based platforms such as Twitch, the gaming industry is becoming both a source of entertainment and participation by mainstream consumers. We sponsor and work closely with esports athletes to improve our brand and the quality and functionality of our gaming products. We also offer gaming peripherals that enhance the experience of more casual gamers.
The use of video across multiple platforms - PCs, laptops and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones - is a continuing trend. The video communication industry continues to make progress toward a vision in which people can conduct a video call from any of these platforms to any other platform. And this trend to embrace cloud video conferencing by businesses and institutions is driving our Video Collaboration category and offers a long-term growth opportunity for Logitech. For businesses and institutions, video conferencing is increasingly substituted for travel, because of high travel costs as well as the productivity gain that can be achieved by a high-quality face-to-face meeting that does not require travel away from the office. Further, with the increased availability of high Internet bandwidth, video conferencing is becoming a key component of Unified Communications, which is the integration of communications solutions such as voicemail, e-mail, chat, presentation sharing and live video meetings. The market opportunity to provide innovative, affordable, and easy-to-use video collaboration products to the millions of small- to medium-sized meeting rooms lacking video is substantial, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of that opportunity and to expand into large-sized meeting rooms. 
Cloud-based music services have enjoyed tremendous growth, fueled by the adoption of smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices. Consumers are optimizing their audio experiences on their tablets and smartphones with wireless mobile speakers that pair easily with their mobile devices and with in-ear and other headphones. Our mobile speakers and in-ear headphone products target a large and growing market that reflects the increasing popularity of mobile devices or various voice assistants for accessing digital music. Additionally, within the music market, consumers are increasingly listening with wireless earphones while they undertake other activities such as sports. The innovation in truly wireless headphones has led to double-digit industry growth in revenue and average selling price, which highlights a major opportunity for Logitech. 
The home is also an important place for technological development, particularly as an increasing number of objects become connected smart home devices such as home security cameras, light bulbs, security locks, thermostats and others. Logitech’s line of universal remotes and hubs control electronic and connected devices around the home as well as these other smart devices. 
Business Strategy
Logitech's foundation for future growth is built on five core capabilities that apply to all of our product categories: 
•Design; 
•Engineering;
•Go-to-market;
•Marketing; and
•Operations. 
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K | 4

Design
In the past few years, Logitech has strengthened its design capabilities by building a world-class team of internal designers. Our designs have an everyday place in people’s lives, connecting them to the digital experiences they care about. These products have been earning prestigious design awards - 215 design awards during the past five fiscal years - and enthusiastic reviews in the media. This is an important indication that Logitech’s strategic aim to become a design company is working. During fiscal year 2019, we won 50 design awards spanning all of our product categories. As Logitech establishes itself as a design company, design thinking and culture are used as a strategic and cultural differentiator. Design also helps to reduce product costs through increased collaboration between our design, engineering and manufacturing teams. Our key design centers are in Switzerland, Ireland, the United States, and Taiwan.
Engineering
Our decades-long expertise in key engineering disciplines such as sensors, acoustics, optics, wireless, and power management is a core competitive advantage of Logitech. Furthermore, we continue to extend our engineering capabilities into more advanced technologies such as software, apps, cloud, data analytics and machine learning. Our engineering team has expertise in developing products for a broad array of platforms such as PCs, mobile and personal voice assistants (such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant). These engineering capabilities combined with our award-winning design team form the basis of Logitech's key innovation engine. 
 Go-To-Market
Over the past 30-plus years, Logitech has built an extensive global go-to-market network that can be leveraged as we introduce new products, enter new market categories and optimize the value of our existing products and product categories. We have multiple opportunities to drive growth - existing products in existing retailers, new products in existing retailers, existing products in new retailers, and new products in new retailers. Beyond traditional retail and distribution channels, we have also cultivated various non-traditional retail channels and are building our direct sales force to sell our products. As we continue to expand into new channels, there are numerous cross-selling opportunities across our broad product portfolio. We have established Logitech as a neutral technology supplier that can work with leading technology vendors and platforms as well as provide connections among their products and ecosystems. 
 Marketing
As Logitech expands into multiple categories with multiple brands, we are focusing on enhancing our marketing capabilities around brand strategy and execution, digital marketing, and marketing technology. Most of the marketing and creative efforts that were once outsourced to outside marketing agencies are now executed through our internal teams from concept to execution, which improves speed and cost efficiency. We are increasing our leverage of digital media channels and programs to drive consumer brand engagement and purchase. We are also increasing our focus on marketing analytics platforms to improve our understanding of marketing investments and to maximize return on investment (ROI). And we are making investments to upgrade and expand all aspects of our marketing technology infrastructure, including the re-platforming of our websites to support the global expansion of our brands across countries, languages and devices and provide the foundation for the acceleration of our digital marketing efforts and evolution to personalized consumer communication. 
Operations
Logitech’s operations capability consists of a hybrid model of in-house manufacturing and third-party contract manufacturers, which allows us to effectively respond to rapidly changing demand and leverage economies of scale. Our supply chain’s extensive global reach, key distribution, adoption of factory automation and strategic business relationships combined with extensive analytic modeling expertise, optimization tools and global processes provide a competitive advantage against many of our competitors. 
Products
 Logitech designs, manufactures and markets products that allow people to connect through music, gaming, video, computing, and other digital platforms. The large majority of our revenue has historically been derived from sales of our products for use by consumers.

Our distributor customers typically resell products to retailers, value-added resellers, systems integrators and other distributors with whom Logitech does not have a direct relationship.
Logitech's products can be purchased in most major retail chains, where we typically have access to significant shelf space. In the U.S., these chains include Best Buy, Walmart, Staples, Office Depot and Target. In Europe, chains include Metro Group (Media-Saturn Group), Elkjop, FNAC, and Dixons Stores Group PLC. Logitech also sells products to non-traditional retail channels such as telcos. In addition, Logitech products can be purchased online either directly from Logitech.com or through e-tailers, such as Amazon.com, the websites of our major retail chains noted previously, and others. Logitech products are also carried by business-to-business direct market resellers such as CDW, Insight, Zones, PC Connection, and SHI.
In fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, Ingram Micro and its affiliated entities together accounted for 13%, 15% and 15% of our gross sales, respectively. In fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, Amazon Inc. and its affiliated entities together accounted for 14%, 13% and 12% of our gross sales, respectively. No other customer individually accounted for more than 10% of our gross sales during fiscal years 2019, 2018 or 2017. 
The material terms of our distribution agreements with Ingram Micro and its affiliated entities are summarized as follows:

• | The agreements are non-exclusive in the particular territory and contain no minimum purchase requirements.


• | Each agreement may be terminated for convenience at any time by either party. Most agreements provide for termination on 30 days written notice from either party, with two Ingram Micro agreements providing for termination on 90 days notice.


• | We generally offer an allowance for marketing activities equal to a negotiated percentage of sales and volume rebates related to purchase volumes or sales of specific products to specified retailers. These terms vary by agreement.


• | Agreements allow price protection credits to be issued for on-hand or in-transit new inventory if we, in our sole discretion, lower the price of the product.

Through our operating subsidiaries, we maintain marketing and channel support offices in approximately 40 countries.
Backlog
In our experience, the amount of backlog at any particular fiscal period-end is not a meaningful indication of our future business prospects, as the cycle between order and shipment of our sales is generally relatively short, and also the backlog is impacted by the commercial cycle of our products. 
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K | 9

Customer Service and Technical Support
Our customer service organization provides user technical support, support related to product inquiry, and order support. We support these customer service functions with an outsourced operation that has support centers located in China, South Korea, India, the Philippines, Mexico, Bulgaria and Northern Ireland. Our customer service and technical personnel in each of our regions provide support services to retail purchasers of products through telephone, e-mail, forums, chat, and the Logitech Support website. For some of our brands, dedicated support websites and channels are available. Logitech provides warranties on our branded products that range from one to five years. For our Video Collaboration business, we also work with channel partners to offer bundled support services with Logitech Video Collaboration solutions.
In Korea, India, and China, there are multiple locations where consumers may obtain service for their Logitech products. These locations are managed by third-party logistics providers. Consumers who have purchased Logitech products can visit these locations for product inspection, testing and return or exchange of products. Within China, there is also a mail-in center to provide these services for more remote locations in China.
Manufacturing
Logitech's manufacturing operations consist principally of final assembly and testing. Since 1994, we have had our own manufacturing operations in Suzhou, China, which currently handles approximately half of our total production of products. We continue to focus on ensuring the efficiency of the Suzhou facilities, through the implementation of quality management, automation, process improvements, and employee involvement programs. We outsource the remaining production to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers located in Asia. Both our in-house and outsourced manufacturing operations are managed by our worldwide operations group. The worldwide operations group also supports the business units and marketing and sales organizations through the management of distribution centers and the supply chain and the provision of technical support and other services.
New product launches, process engineering, commodities management, logistics, quality assurance, operations management and management of Logitech's contract manufacturers occur in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Certain components are manufactured to Logitech's specifications by vendors in Asia, the United States, and Europe. We also use contract manufacturers to supplement internal capacity and to reduce volatility in production volumes. In addition, some products, including most keyboards, certain gaming devices and certain audio products are manufactured by contract manufacturers to Logitech's specifications. 
Our hybrid model of in-house manufacturing and contract manufacturers allows us to effectively respond to rapidly changing demand and leverage economies of scale. Through our high-volume manufacturing operations located in Suzhou, China, we believe we have been able to maintain strong quality process controls and have realized significant cost efficiencies. Our Suzhou operation provides for increased production capacity, manufacturing know-how, IP protection and greater flexibility in responding to product demand. Further, by outsourcing the manufacturing of certain products, we seek to reduce volatility in production volumes as well as improve time to market.
Competition
Our product categories are characterized by large, well-financed competitors, short product life cycles, continual performance enhancements, and rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in our retail markets. We have experienced aggressive price competition and other promotional activities from our primary competitors and less-established brands, including brands owned by some retail customers known as house brands. We may also encounter more competition if any of our competitors in one or more categories decide to enter other categories in which we currently operate.
As we target opportunities in new categories and markets and as some of our product categories demonstrate growth, we are confronting new competitors, many of which may have more experience in the categories or markets and have greater marketing resources and brand name recognition than we have. In addition, because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics, we expect greater competition in the future from well-established consumer electronics companies in our developing categories, as well as future ones we might enter. Many of these companies have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than we have. 
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K | 10

We expect continued competitive pressure in our business, including in the terms and conditions that our competitors offer customers, which may be more favorable than our terms and conditions and may require us to take actions to increase our customer incentive programs, which could impact our sales and operating margins.
Creativity and Productivity
Pointing Devices: Apple, Microsoft Corporation and HP Inc. are our main competitors worldwide. We also experience competition and pricing pressure from less-established brands, including house brands and local competitors in Asian markets, such as Elecom Co., Ltd., Buffalo Inc., Shenzhen Rapoo Technology Co., Ltd., and Xiaomi Inc. 
Keyboards & Combos: Microsoft and Apple are the main competitors in our PC keyboard and combo product lines. We also experience competition and pricing pressure for corded and cordless keyboard and combos from less-established brands, including house brands and local competitors in Asian markets.
Tablet & Other Accessories: Competitors in the tablet keyboard market are Apple, Zagg Inc., Kensington Computer Products Group, Belkin International, Inc., Targus Corporation and other less-established brands. Although we are one of the leaders in the tablet keyboard market and continue to bring innovative offerings to the market, we expect the competition may increase. Competitors in the tablet case market include Apple, Otter Products LLC, Speck Products and a large number of small brands.

Our competitors for Blue Microphones products include Rode Microphones LLC, Audio Technica Corporation, Samson Technologies, Shure Inc, Razer Inc and Apogee Electronics, among others.
Smart Home  
Direct competitors in the remote control market include pro-installer-focused Universal Remote Control Inc., and new “DIY” entrants. Indirect competition exists in the form of low-end “replacement remotes” such as Sony Corporation, RCA Corporation, General Electric Company (GE), pure app-based solutions such as Peel Technologies, as well as device and/or subscriber-specific solutions from TV makers such as Samsung and Vizio and multiple-system operators (MSOs) such as Comcast Corporation and DirecTV. Competition in the home control market also exists in the form of home automation platforms such as Smart Things (owned by Samsung), Amazon with its Echo product, Google Home and Nest (owned by Alphabet Inc.), Wink and many other startups in the 
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K | 11

space. Many of these products and brands are partners with Logitech as well via integrations with Harmony remotes.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Intellectual property rights that apply to Logitech's products and services include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets.
We hold various United States patents and pending applications, together with corresponding patents and pending applications from other countries. While we believe that patent protection is important, we also believe that patents are of less competitive significance than factors such as technological innovation, ease of use, and quality design. No single patent is in itself essential to Logitech as a whole. From time to time we receive claims that we may be infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights of others. As appropriate, claims are referred to counsel, and current claims are in various stages of evaluation and negotiation. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses for certain intellectual property rights. Refer also to the discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors—"We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in the development of products that compete with our products." and "Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could adversely affect our business."
To distinguish genuine Logitech products from competing products and counterfeit products, Logitech has used, registered, or applied to register certain trademarks and trade names in the United States and other countries and jurisdictions. Logitech enforces its trademark and trade name rights in the United States and other countries. In addition, the software for Logitech's products and services is entitled to copyright protection, and we generally require our customers to obtain a software license before providing them with that software. We also protect details about our products and services as trade secrets through employee training, license and non-disclosure agreements, technical measures and other reasonable efforts to preserve confidentiality.
Environmental Regulation
We are subject to laws and regulations in many jurisdictions regulating the materials used in our products and, increasingly, product-related energy consumption, and the recycling of our products, batteries, and packaging.
Europe.    In Europe, we are subject to the European Union's (EU's), Restriction of Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS Directive). This directive restricts the placement into the EU market of electrical and electronic equipment containing certain hazardous materials including lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, phthalates and halogenated flame-retardants. All Logitech products are covered by the directive and have been modified, if necessary, to be compliant with the RoHS Directive, we issue a declaration of conformity and mark the product with the 'CE' mark.
We are also subject to the EU's Energy-related Products Directive (ErP Directive), which aims to encourage manufacturers and importers to produce products designed to minimize overall environmental impact. Under the ErP Directive, manufacturers must ensure that their energy-related products comply with applicable requirements, issue a declaration of conformity and mark the product with the 'CE' mark. 
We have assessed the applicability and implementation of the applicable measures on our relevant product lines and have taken steps to ensure that our products meet the requirements. Adoption of the ErP Directive will be aligned in all EU member states. Similar requirements exist in the four member states of the European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland). Such requirements are substantially met by compliance with the ErP Directive.
We are also subject to a number of End of Life Stewardship directives including the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, the EU Packaging Directive and the EU Battery Directive, which require producers of electrical goods, packaging, and batteries to be financially responsible for costs of specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered products. Where applicable, we have provided for the estimated costs, which are not material, of managing and recycling historical and future waste equipment, packaging and batteries. We are also subject to the European REACH Directive (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restrictions of Chemicals) (REACH Directive) and we have taken steps to ensure that our relevant product lines are compliant with the applicable provision of the REACH Directive. 
China.    In China, we are subject to China's laws on Management Methods on the Control of Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products (the China RoHS laws). The China RoHS laws are substantially similar to the EU 
Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K | 12

RoHS Directive, and as such, our products are already compliant. The China RoHS laws require additional labeling of products that will be shipped to China and we have taken steps to ensure we comply with these requirements.
United States and Canada.    In the U.S., we are subject to, among other laws, the Appliance Efficiency Regulations adopted via the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The regulations set out standards for the energy consumption performance of products and such standards apply to appliances sold or offered for sale throughout the U.S. We have redesigned or changed certain of our products to ensure compliance with these regulations. We are also subject to California's Proposition 65, which requires that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to certain chemicals deemed by the state of California to be dangerous.
Logitech is also subject to the requirement as set out by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, specifically Section 1502, which addresses the use of "Conflict Minerals" in the supply chain. We have established systems which facilitate our compliance with the sourcing, traceability and reporting obligations and the reporting requirements of this Act aligned with guidelines published by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance or RBA (formerly the EICC), we participate in the industry-wide Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative and its Conflict-Free Smelter Program by which these requirements are met.
In addition, the Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 (S.B. 657) is effective from Logitech's fiscal year 2012. The law requires all retailers and manufacturers of tangible products who do business in California and have annual worldwide gross receipts exceeding $100 million to disclose on their company websites their efforts to combat forced labor and human trafficking in their own supply chains. Similarly, Logitech complies with the requirements of the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act of 2015 requiring certain commercial organizations to transparently report their efforts to identify and eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. Further information is provided in our annual Sustainability Report and Logitech's disclosure posted on our website, www.logitech.com.
We are subject to laws in various Canadian provinces and U.S. states that impose fees to cover the cost of end of life responsible disposal and recycling of packaging, product, and batteries. These laws require producers of electrical goods, packaging, and batteries to be financially responsible for costs of specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered products. Where applicable, we have provided for the estimated costs, which are not material, of managing and recycling historical and future waste equipment, packaging, and batteries.
Australia and New Zealand.    In Australia and New Zealand, we are subject to the Minimum Energy Performance Standards regulations (MEPS). These regulations set out standards for the energy consumption performance of products within the scope of the regulations, which includes some of our products. We have taken steps to modify products to ensure they are in compliance with MEPS.
We expect further laws governing product and packaging recycling to be introduced in other jurisdictions, many or most of which could impose fees to cover recycling costs, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. If such legislation is enacted in other countries, Logitech intends to develop compliance programs as necessary. However, until that time, we are not able to estimate any possible impact.
The effects on Logitech's business of complying with other government regulations are limited to the cost of agency fees and testing, as well as the time required to obtain agency approvals. There are also stewardship costs associated with the end of life collection, recycling and recovery of Logitech products, packaging and batteries where Logitech is recognized as the steward and participates in relevant programs. The costs and schedule requirements are industry requirements and therefore do not represent an undue burden relative to Logitech's competitive position. As regulations change, we will modify our products or processes to address those changes.
In addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, we also monitor and align with international good practice standards for environmental, social and sustainability performance. We joined the RBA (formerly EICC) in 2007 to collaborate with industry peers to drive international good practice across the electronics sector. Since 2007, we have fully adopted the RBA Code of Conduct and we publish an annual Sustainability Report, in alignment with the good practice standards of the Global Reporting Initiative. For more information on our approach to sustainability management, RBA Code of Conduct compliance and international good practice, refer to our annual Sustainability Report, which is available from the sustainability page on www.logitech.com.

Seasonality
Our product sales are typically seasonal. Sales are generally highest during our third fiscal quarter (October to December) primarily due to the increased consumer demand for our products during the year-end holiday buying season and year-end spending by enterprises. Due to the timing of our new product introductions, we believe that year-over-year comparisons are more indicative of variability in our results of operations than the current quarter to prior quarter comparisons.
Materials
We purchase certain products and key components used in our products from a limited number of sources. If the supply of these products or key components, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, were to be delayed or constrained, or if one or more of our single-source suppliers go out of business, we might be unable to find a new supplier on acceptable terms, or at all, and our shipments to our customers could be delayed. In addition, lead times for materials, components, and products ordered by us or by our contract manufacturers can vary significantly and depend on factors such as contract terms, demand for a component, our ability to forecast product demand, and supplier capacity. From time to time, we have experienced component shortages and extended lead times on semiconductors, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, and base metals used in our products. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of components or subcontracted products, or our inability to procure these components or products from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could delay shipment of our products or increase our production costs.
Employees
As of March 31, 2019, we employed approximately 6,600 regular employees, of which approximately 3,400 employees are in our Suzhou manufacturing facilities, and from the remaining 3,200 regular employees, approximately 740 are dedicated to research and development. None of Logitech's U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Certain other countries, such as China, provide by law for employee rights, which include requirements similar to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good.
