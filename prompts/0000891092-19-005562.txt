 Electronic Cigarettes, Personal Vaporizers, Medical Vaporizers for Cannabis use
 
“Electronic cigarettes” or “e-cigarettes,” are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide. Electronic cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes and, regardless of their construction are comprised of three functional components:

• | a mouthpiece, which is a small plastic cartridge that contains a liquid nicotine solution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the heating element that vaporizes the liquid nicotine so that it can be inhaled; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the electronics, which include: a lithium-ion battery, an airflow sensor, a microchip controller and an LED, which illuminates to indicate use.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
When a user draws air through the electronic cigarette, the air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the solution stored in the mouthpiece /cartridge, the solution is then vaporized and it is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. The cartridge contains either a nicotine solution or a nicotine free solution, either of which may be flavored.
 
Personal vaporizers are similar in form and function to electronic cigarettes but typically have a larger form factor and are used to vaporize solutions that are not nicotine based and may include flavors and or flavor combinations.
 
Medical vaporizers for cannabis use functions similar to electronic cigarettes and vaporizers but have unique design characteristics to enable patients to vape the different forms of cannabis. Generally, these forms are essential oils, concentrates, as well as dry herb. This results in a similar effect but it is cannabis concentrates being vaporized instead of nicotine liquid or a flavored cartridge, so the design has to be changed to vaporize these different textures.
 
Our Electronic Cigarettes, Personal Vaporizers, Medical Vaporizers for Cannabis use
 
Electronic Cigarettes
 
We have developed a line of electronic cigarette e liquids which are currently sold under the brand name “Helium.” We plan to develop a complete line of disposable and rechargeable electronic cigarettes and personal vaporizers. Our electronic cigarettes will be available in multiple sizes, puff counts, flavors and nicotine strengths.
 
Disposable electronic cigarettes feature a one-piece construction that houses all the components and is utilized until the nicotine or nicotine free solution is depleted.
 
Rechargeable electronic cigarettes feature a rechargeable battery and replaceable cartridge. The cartridges are changed when the solution is depleted from use.
 
Personal Vaporizers
 
Personal vaporizers or vaporizers typically feature a tank and a chamber, a heating element and a battery. The vaporizer user fills the tank with a liquid solution or the chamber with wax, dry herb or leaf. The vaporizer battery can be recharged and the tank and chamber can be refilled.
Medical Vaporizers for Cannabis Use
 
We have developed a line of vaporizers that are for use with medical cannabis under the “HONEYSTICK” brand. These vaporizers are designed for sale in the medical and recreational cannabis markets and currently feature mainly vaporizers for essential oils and concentrates. We plan to launch and develop more units for dry herb and continue to expand the line to offer more innovative technology that is high performance and convenient. The company also conducts most of its private label production for cannabis oriented vaporizers.

The U.S. Market for Electronic Cigarettes and Medical Cannabis Vaporizers
 
Electronic cigarettes are generally marketed as an alternative to traditional tobacco burning cigarettes. Because electronic cigarettes offer a “smoking” experience without the burning of tobacco leaf, electronic cigarettes offer users the ability to satisfy their nicotine cravings without the byproducts of smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide. In many cases electronic cigarettes are not subject to the use prohibitions of tobacco-burning cigarettes and therefore may be used in more places than conventional cigarettes. Certain states, cities, businesses, providers of transportation and public venues in the U.S. have already banned the use of electronic cigarettes, however, and others are considering banning the use of electronic cigarettes. We cannot provide any assurances that the use of electronic cigarettes will not be banned anywhere traditional tobacco burning cigarette use is banned.
 
We believe that the market for medical and recreational cannabis products, including cannabis vape products, continues to expand as the legal climate within the U.S. has resulted in more states permitting recreational and/or medical cannabis use. Vape products are growing as a delivery device because they allow very convenient, effective and discrete ways of delivery that minimize, odor and exposure. Vape products also allow for the vaporization of all textures of cannabis, which allows for effective dosing. Currently, 29 U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia, have passed laws permitting their citizens to use medical cannabis. Nine states and the District of Columbia permit the recreational use of cannabis, and a number of states have also decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana. Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”), and the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), and therefore it is illegal to grow, possess and consume cannabis under federal law. The Controlled Substances Act of 1910 (the “CSA”) bans cannabis-related businesses; the possession, cultivation and production of cannabis-infused products; and the distribution of cannabis and products derived from it. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court has confirmed that the federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, including for medical purposes, and that federal law criminalizing the use of cannabis preempts state laws that legalize its use.
 
Under the Obama Administration, the DOJ previously issued memoranda, including the so-called “Cole Memo” on August 29, 2013, providing internal guidance to federal prosecutors concerning enforcement of federal cannabis prohibitions under the CSA. This guidance essentially characterized use of federal law enforcement resources to prosecute those complying with state laws allowing the use, manufacture and distribution of cannabis as an inefficient use of such federal resources when state laws and enforcement efforts are effective with respect to specific federal enforcement priorities under the CSA.
  5

 
On January 4, 2018, the then U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a written memorandum rescinding the Cole Memo and related internal guidance issued by the DOJ regarding federal law enforcement priorities involving marijuana (the “Sessions Memo”). The Sessions Memo instructs federal prosecutors that when determining which marijuana-related activities to prosecute under federal law with the DOJ’s finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles set forth in the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual governing all federal prosecutions. The Sessions Memo states that “these principles require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJ’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
 
It is unclear at this time what impact the Sessions Memo will have on the medical-use or recreational marijuana industry. In addition, pursuant to the current omnibus spending provisions approved by Congress, the DOJ was prohibited from using funds appropriated by Congress to prevent states from implementing their medical-use cannabis laws. This provision, however, will expire on September 30, 2019, and there is no assurance that Congress will approve inclusion of a similar prohibition on DOJ spending in the appropriations bill going forward. Although we are not engaged in the purchase, sale, growth, cultivation, harvesting, or processing of marijuana products, strict enforcement of federal prohibitions regarding marijuana could irreparably harm our business, subject us to criminal prosecution and/or adversely affect the trading price of our securities. We cannot provide any assurances that federal regulations will not inhibit the growth, expansion, or legality of the cannabis movement which is highly interdependent in the growth of sales of our vaporizers.
 
Global Market
 
The global e-cigarette market is expected to grow over $50 billion by 2025, at an estimated compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 22.36% from 2015 to 2025. The market will witness a staggering growth until 2017, by when most of the regulatory and policy framework will fall into place. The growth rate will significantly increase thereafter, with significant revenue generation from evolving markets of Asia Pacific (“APAC”) and Europe.
 
Moreover, while disposable e-cigarettes dominated the global e-cigarette product market until 2014, we expect that rechargeable e-cigarettes, followed by personal vaporizers and mods, will soon take over the top market positions in terms of revenue generation. The U.S. market will continue with its dominance through the forecast period, however, China is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR to become the second largest revenue generating country by the end of 2025.
 
North American sales are projected to top $20.2 billion by 2021 assuming a compound annual growth rate of 25%. The report includes Canada for the first time as it moves towards implementing legal adult use marijuana.
 
To put this in perspective, this industry growth is larger and faster than even the dot-com era. During that time, GDP grew at a blistering pace of 22%. Thirty percent is an astounding number especially when you consider that the industry is in early stages.
 
Distribution and Sales
 
The distribution and sales strategy for our products is tailored to the characteristics of each market, whether it be geographical, demographical, or genre (cannabis or E Liquid).
  6

 
Our sales and distribution channels are:
 

• | Direct sales and distribution, where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution within a single market. 
• | Exclusive territory and exclusive channel distribution, where distributors have an exclusive territory within a country or an exclusive right to sell within a distribution channel (e.g. gas station).
• | Distribution through wholesalers, where we supply either national or regional wholesalers who then service retailers. 
• | Internet/e-commerce sales, where we sell directly to end users through one of our internet websites and/or landing pages. 
• | Distribution through online distributors that sell to an extensive network of resellers. 
• | Distribution through dispensaries who are responsible for dispensing medical or recreational cannabis. 

Business Strategy
 
VPR Brands is a holding company, whose assets include issued U.S. and Chinese patents for atomization related products, including technology for medical marijuana vaporizers and electronic cigarette products and components. The Company is also engaged in product development for the vapor or vaping market, including e-liquids. Electronic cigarettes are electronic devices which deliver nicotine through atomization, or vaping of e-liquids and without smoke and other chemicals constituents typically found in traditional tobacco burning cigarette products.
 
Our portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents (the "Patents") are the basis for our efforts to:
 

• | Design, market and distribute a line of e liquids under the “HELIUM” brand; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Design, market and distribute a line vaporizers for essential oils, concentrates, and dry herbs under the “HONEYSTICK” brand;
• | Design, market and distribute a line of CBD products under the “GOLD LINE” brand; 
• | Design, market and distribute electronic cigarettes and popular vaporizers; 


• | Prosecute and enforce our patent rights;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | License our intellectual property; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | Develop private label manufacturing programs.
--+----------------------------------------------

 
We design, develop and market electronic cigarette e-liquids sold under the Helium brand. Our electronic cigarette e-liquids are marketed as an alternative to tobacco burning cigarettes. We launched the Helium brand in limited U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and grow distribution through third-party distributors. Shortly after our U.S. launch we plan to introduce our electronic cigarette brand to the Chinese market. China is the largest producer and consumer of tobacco products in the world, however we believe that Chinese consumption of electronic cigarettes trails U.S. adoption and use. We believe that an opportunity exists to develop and expand our business and our Helium brand electronic cigarette e-liquids in China.
 
We design, develop, market and distribute a line of products oriented toward the cannabis markets which is the HoneyStick brand of vaporizers and the Goldline CBD products. The CBD line was in development during 2017 and the HoneyStick brand was acquired in July 2016 and further developed and expanded continuously throughout 2017 and 2018 by adding new products and expansion in marketing and advertising. This allows us to capitalize on the rapidly growing expansion within the cannabis markets. The original HoneyStick vaporizer placed second in the
  7

 High Times SoCal Cannabis Cup in 2016, greatly popularizing the brand and making its performance recognized. A HoneyStick vaporizer also won an award in 2017.
 
Patent Rights
 
We are evaluating our options and conducting investigations to determine if our intellectual property is being infringed and if so, by whom, both in the U.S. and in the Peoples Republic of China. In the U.S., we are exploring legal options and strategies related to prosecuting infringers and pursuing available remedies.
License our Technology
 
In light of recent lawsuits filed against several electronic cigarette companies, we believe that an opportunity exists to license our patented technology to companies named in those lawsuits and others who may be seeking an alternative to the electronic cigarette technologies which are or may be subject to patent litigation.
Private Label
 
As an extension of our plan to license our technology to other electronic cigarette companies, we plan to offer private label manufacturing programs for electronic cigarette as well as cannabis vape companies that would rather purchase a finished manufactured product, rather than simply purchasing a license to manufacture their products using our technology. We believe that we have a greater understanding of the manufacturing process than a licensee would and that we can better oversee the manufacturing process of our patented technologies and offer a more reliable and higher quality product through our supply chain than can otherwise be achieved by third parties.
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in New York on July 19, 2004, as Jobsinsite.com, Inc. On August 5, 2004, we changed our name to Jobsinsite, Inc. On June 18, 2009, we merged with a Delaware corporation and became Jobsinsite, Inc. On July 1, 2009, we filed articles of conversion with the secretary of state of Delaware and became Soleil Capital L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. On September 2, 2015, we changed our name to VPR Brands, LP. We are managed by Soleil Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
 
Since our inception, the Company has generated nominal revenues through the sale of software items related to the job search industry and in 2009, management actively explored opportunities to manage private capital. Specifically, the Company had plans to sponsor and manage limited partnerships organized for the purpose of exploring opportunities to acquire securities in secondary transactions of venture backed businesses and dispensing capital to seed stage venture capital opportunities. As a result of the Company’s new business direction and in an effort to establish operations in the venture capital and private equity industry, the Company has reorganized the business and restructured the Company as a public limited partnership. In 2013, management identified an opportunity to acquire a portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizers patents. In connection with this transaction the Company’s business objectives pivoted and the Company is now focusing its efforts on the electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer industry and is pursuing plans to commercialize and monetize its portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents. Prior to the Company’s decision to design, develop and market electronic cigarette e-liquids sold under the Helium brand in March 2016, the Company had designed, developed and marketed electronic cigarettes sold under the RED brand.
 
On December 27, 2013, the Company entered into a patent acquisition agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and among the Company and Guocheng "Greg" Pan, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase certain electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents owned and invented by Mr. Pan (the "Purchased Assets"). Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement and in consideration for the acquisition of the Purchased Assets, the Company issued to Mr. Pan (and certain of his designees) 10,501,700 common units representing limited partnership units of the Company and a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 common units representing limited partnership units of the Company. The warrants entitle Mr. Pan (or his designees) to purchase common units of the Company at $0.15 per common unit with an expiration date ten years from the effective date of the Purchase Agreement.
  8

 
The patents were originally valued based on number of shares issued, warrants issued, valuation of the traded stock at the time of issuance and similar patents sold during the year. Based on these assumptions, the Company has valued the assets purchased at approximately $5.5 million at the time of purchase. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company determined due to lack of sales and projected sales and completion in the industry the value of the patent should be significantly reduced. As a result, the Company has written off the entire patent.
 
In April 2015, the Company issued 25,000 of the Company’s common units to Gordon Hung in exchange for services for the Company valued at $12,500.
 
On May 29, 2015, the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Kevin Frija (“Frija Share Purchase Agreement”) for a private placement (“Private Placement”) of up to 50,000,000 common units representing limited partnership interests of the Company. The Private Placement was expected to occur in multiple tranches. For the first tranche, on June 4, 2015, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its common units to Mr. Frija at a purchase price of $0.01 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $100,000 to the Company. In subsequent tranches, Mr. Frija had the right to buy an additional 40,000,000 common units at a purchase price of $0.01 per share. The Company expected to receive gross proceeds of $400,000 in the aggregate upon the closing of the subsequent tranches of the Private Placement, which is expected to be completed by September, 2016. No placement agent has participated in the Private Placement.
 
In connection with the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company named Mr. Frija chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Company and as a manager of the Company’s general partner, Soleil Capital Management LLC (the “General Partner”). Contemporaneous with Mr. Frija’s appointment as chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Directors, the Company’s current chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors, Messrs. Jon Pan and Greg Pan, respectively, have resigned from their respective positions. Notwithstanding, Mr. Greg Pan continues to serve as a member of the board of directors of the Company and as a manager of the General Partner and Mr. Jon Pan continues to serve as a consultant to the Company. In consideration and as severance, for Jon Pan’s resignation as chief executive officer, the Company and the General Partner have entered into that certain Share Purchase Agreement with Jon Pan wherein the Company agreed to grant Jon Pan the right to purchase 10,000,000 of the Company’s Common Units, at a price of $0.01 per share.
 
In August 2015, the Company issued 1,980,000 of the Company’s common unit to the former CEO, Jon Pan in exchange for repayment of funds advanced of $8,000 and future consulting services totaling $11,800. The Company will amortize the prepaid expenses over the next 15 months starting October 1, 2015.
 
On September 2, 2015, in accordance with authority granted to the General Partner under the Company’s Limited Partnership Agreement, the General Partner changed the Company’s name (“Name Change”) from Soleil Capital L.P. to VPR Brands, LP by filing an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Limited Partnership with the Delaware Secretary of State. Accordingly, on September 10, 2015, the Company’s General Partner also amended the Company’s Limited Partnership Agreement to reflect the Name Change from Soleil Capital L.P. to VPR Brands, LP. On September 17, 2015, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved the Name Change and the Company’s new trading symbol VPRB.
 
The Company, Soleil Capital Management LLC and Greg Pan entered into a Termination of Share Purchase Agreement on August 18, 2015, which terminated the Share Purchase Agreement, dated June 1, 2015, among the Company, Soleil Capital Management LLC and Greg Pan.
 
On December 9, 2015, Kevin Frija sold an aggregate of 9,000,000 of his shares of Common Units at a sale price of $0.01 per share (for an aggregate of $90,000) to Jacob Levy (1,000,000 shares), Nissim Levy (1,000,000 shares), Sara Morad (1,000,000 shares), Yaron Edery (1,000,000 shares), Barry Rub (2,000,000 shares), Hannah Frija (2,000,000 shares), and Ralph Frija (1,000,000 shares).
 
On March 28, 2016, Mr. Frija exercised a right to buy 15,000,000 shares of the Common Units at a purchase price of $0.01 per share, resulting in 15,000,000 shares of Common Units issued to Mr. Frija in exchange for gross proceeds of $150,000 to the Company, pursuant to the terms of the Frija Share Purchase Agreement, leaving a balance of 25,000,000 shares of Common Units to purchase at $0.01 per share under the right to buy under the Frija Share Purchase Agreement.

 On April 29, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 720,000 common units, valued at $0.02 per common unit (for an aggregate of $14,400), to four consultants as total compensation paid-in-advance for services related to product development, creative direction and sales and marketing to be provided under their respective consulting agreements with the Company.
 
On May 23, 2016 ($20,000) and May 31, 2016 ($20,000) and June 16, 2016 ($10,000), pursuant to the terms of the Frija Share Purchase Agreement, Mr. Frija exercised a right to buy 5,000,000 Common Units at a purchase price of $0.01 per unit, resulting in 5,000,000 Common Units issued to Mr. Frija in exchange for total gross proceeds of $50,000 to the Company, leaving a balance of 20,000,000 Common Units to purchase at $0.01 per unit (an aggregate purchase price of $200,000) under the right to buy under the Frija Share Purchase Agreement.
 
On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Vapor Corp. (“Vapor”) and the Company’ Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Frija (the former Chief Executive Officer of Vapor), pursuant to which Vapor sold Vapor’s wholesale operations and inventory related thereto (collectively, “Assets”) to the Company, which Vapor’s business is operated at 3001 Griffin Road, Dania Beach, Florida 33312. The Vapor acquisition and the line of business was accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of the exchange, of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for the business line acquired. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
 
The Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with DiamondRock, LLC, an unaffiliated third party (“DiamondRock”), pursuant to which the Company sold to Diamond Rock a $500,000 convertible promissory note (the “Note”) for a purchase price of $475,000, reflecting an original issue discount of $25,000. The transactions under the SPA closed on November 29, 2016, and the Note was issued on that date.
 
The Note permits the Company to make additional borrowings under the Note. On November 29, 2016, DiamondRock advanced the first tranche to the Company in the amount of $71,250, which reflected the first borrowing in the amount of $75,000, less the prorated portion of the original issue discount.
 
Amounts advanced under the Note bear interest at the rate of 8% per year, and the maturity date for each tranche is 12 months from the funding of the applicable tranche. The Company may prepay any amount outstanding under the Note prior to the actual maturity date for a 35%.
 
DiamondRock has the right to convert the outstanding and unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the respective tranche of the Note into shares of common stock of the Company, subject to the limitation that DiamondRock may not complete a conversion if doing so would cause DiamondRock to own in excess of 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, provided that DiamondRock may waive that limitation and increase the ownership cap to up to 9.99%. The conversion price for any conversion under the Note is equal to the lesser of (i) $0.50 and (ii) 65% of the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s common over the 7 trading days ending on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the conversion. In addition, in the event that the Company enters into certain transactions with other parties that provide for a conversion price at a larger discount (than 35%) to the trading price of the Company’s common stock, or provides for a longer look-back period, then the conversion price and look-back period under the Note will be adjusted to be such lower conversion price and longer look-back period, as applicable.
 
If at any time while the Note is outstanding, the Company enters into a transaction structured in accordance with, based upon, or related or pursuant to, in whole or in part, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (covering certain exchange transactions), then a liquidated damages charge of 25% of the outstanding principal balance of the Note at that time will be assessed and will become immediately due and payable to DiamondRock, either in the form of cash payment or as an addition to the balance of the Note, as determined by mutual agreement of the Company and DiamondRock.
 
The Note also contains a right of first refusal such that, if at any time while the Note is outstanding, the Company has a bona fide offer of capital or financing from any 3rd party that the Company intends to act upon, then the Company must first offer such opportunity to DiamondRock to provide such capital or financing on the same terms. The SPA and the Note contain customary representations, warranties and covenants for transactions of this type.

On November 28, 2016, the Company and Kevin Frija, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, entered into a Termination of Certain Provisions of Share Purchase Agreement (the “Frija Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company and Mr. Frija terminated, to the extent not already completed, the rights and obligations of the parties under Section 2 and Section 3 of the Share Purchase Agreement entered into between them on May 29, 2015.
 
The Frija Termination Agreement operated to terminate, to the extent not already completed, all of the options, rights and obligations of the parties under Section 2 and Section 3 of the Frija SPA, which sections provided for the sale of up to 50,000,000 shares of the Company’s common units (“Common Units”) by the Company to Mr. Frija at a price of $0.01 per Share.

(i) | June 4, 2015 - 10,000,000 Common Units, for gross proceeds of $100,000 to the Company;

To the extent not terminated by the Frija Termination Agreement and the Pan Termination Agreement, the Frija SPA and the Pan SPA, respectively, remained in full force and effect.

Competition
 
Competition in the electronic cigarette and vaporizer industry is intense. We compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes, the nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to ours and through the same channels through which we sell our electronic cigarette products. We compete with these direct competitors for sales through distributors, wholesalers and retailers, including but not limited to national chain stores, tobacco shops,
  15

 dispensaries gas stations, travel stores, shopping mall kiosks, in addition to direct to public sales through the internet, mail order and telesales. As a general matter, we have access to and market and sell the similar electronic cigarettes as our competitors and since we sell our products at substantially similar prices as our competitors.
 
Part of our business strategy focuses on the establishment of contractual relationships with distributors and prominent branding focused on performance and quality. We are aware that e-cigarette competitors in the industry are also seeking to enter into such contractual relationships and try to create brand loyalty. In many cases, competitors for such contracts may have greater management, human, and financial resources than we do for entering into such contracts and for attracting distributor relationships. Furthermore, certain of our electronic cigarette competitors may have better control of their supply and distribution, be, better established, larger and better financed than our Company.
 
We also compete against “big tobacco”, U.S. cigarette manufacturers of both conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes like Altria Group, Inc., Lorillard, Inc. and Reynolds American, Inc. We compete against “big tobacco” who offers not only conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes but also smokeless tobacco products such as “snus” (a form of moist ground smokeless tobacco that is usually sold in sachet form that resembles small tea bags), chewing tobacco and snuff. “Big tobacco” has nearly limitless resources, global distribution networks in place and a customer base that is fiercely loyal to their brands. Furthermore, we believe that “big tobacco” will devote more attention and resources to developing and offering electronic cigarettes as the market for electronic cigarettes grows. Because of their well-established sales and distribution channels, marketing expertise and significant resources, “big tobacco” is better positioned than small competitors like us to capture a larger share of the electronic cigarette market.
 
We also face competition from manufacturers in China as they try to increase their USA presence by marketing directly to members within our supply and value chain similar products.
 
We may also face competition from other patent holders, including but not limited to, Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Europe’s second-biggest tobacco company, who in September, 2013 acquired a portfolio of electronic cigarette patents from buy Dragonite International Ltd.’s (formerly Ruyan Group Holdings Limited) for $75 million, as we attempt to negotiate and contract with other electronic cigarette companies to license our intellectual property.
 
Manufacturing
 
We depend on third party manufacturers for our electronic cigarettes, vaporizers and accessories. Our customers associate certain characteristics of our products including the weight, feel, draw, unique flavor, packaging and other attributes of our products to the brands we market, distribute and sell. Any interruption in supply and/or consistency of our products may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products to our wholesalers, distributors and customers and otherwise harm our relationships and reputation with customers, and have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Although we believe that several alternative sources for our products are available, any failure to obtain the components, chemical constituents and manufacturing services necessary for the production of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We believe that an adequate supply of product and raw materials will be available to us as needed and from multiple sources and suppliers.

 Government Regulation
 
Pursuant to a December 2010, decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in Sottera, Inc. v. Food & Drug Administration, 627 F.3d 891 (D.C. Cir. 2010), the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) is permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as “tobacco products” under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the “Tobacco Control Act”).
 
Under this Court decision, the FDA is not permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as “drugs” or “devices” or a “combination product” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes.
 
Because we do not market our electronic cigarettes for therapeutic purposes, our electronic cigarettes are subject to being classified as “tobacco products” under the Tobacco Control Act. The Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero.
 
The Tobacco Control Act also requires establishment, within the FDA’s new Center for Tobacco Products, of a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products.
 
The Tobacco Control Act imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. For example, the law requires the FDA to finalize certain portions of regulations previously adopted by the FDA in 1996 (which were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2000 as beyond the FDA’s authority). As written, these regulations would significantly limit the ability of manufacturers, distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products, by, for example, restricting the use of color, graphics and sound effects in advertising, limiting the use of outdoor advertising, restricting the sale and distribution of non-tobacco items and services, gifts, and sponsorship of events and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless tobacco products of trade or brand names that are used for non-tobacco products. The law also requires the FDA to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold or distributed over the internet, by mail order or through other non-face-to-face transactions in order to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.
 
It is likely that the Tobacco Control Act could result in a decrease in tobacco product sales in the United States, including sales of our electronic cigarettes.
 
On April 24, 2014 the Food and Drug Administration released a proposed set of deeming regulations on electronic cigarettes and other nicotine and tobacco based products. The proposed regulations include the following requirements:
 
• | Manufacturers would need to register each of their manufacturing facilities with the FDA, submit a product list including a list of ingredients, and report any harmful and potentially harmful constituents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retailers would not be allowed to provide free samples of electronic cigarettes to adults.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The minimum age to purchase electronic cigarettes in addition to other deemed tobacco products would be 18 years old and retailers will be required to verify through photographic identification the legal minimum age of a customer who is younger than 27 years old.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | For newer tobacco products that were not on the market as of February 15, 2007, manufacturers of these products would need to submit what is called a premarket tobacco application (PMTA) to the FDA within 24 months following the effective date of the final deeming regulations. If a PMTA application is filed with the FDA during this 24 month period, then the manufacturer can continue to market its products unless and until the FDA responds to the application.

• | The FDA would require under a new health warning on the packaging and advertisements for electronic cigarettes which would read: “WARNING: This product contains nicotine derived from tobacco. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The proposed deeming regulation does not ban flavors for electronic cigarettes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the proposed deeming regulations, the FDA acknowledges that the agency does not have sufficient scientific data about e-cigarettes to determine what effect they have on the public health. The FDA will continue to analyze the potential benefits and harms of e-cigarettes and is seeking additional scientific data to determine how e-cigarettes should be regulated given the fact that the products may be lower risk than combustible tobacco products. The FDA may consider additional regulations on e-cigarettes in the future.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The deeming regulations do not include a ban on the Internet sale of e-cigarettes. In addition, the regulations do not restrict or prohibit television advertising of e-cigarettes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
E-cigarette manufacturers are required to complete and file a premarket tobacco application to continue to sell their products. This application procedure is a complicated, expensive and time consuming process. The FDA estimates that it will take a manufacturer approximately 5,000 hours to complete one premarket tobacco application for a tobacco product (electronic cigarette), which would include conducting scientific studies on the new product and submitting all of the relevant paperwork.
 The FDA is accepting comments on the deeming regulations for a period of 75 days, which ends on July 9, 2014. These comments will be important since industry recommendations and data provided to the FDA would all be taken into consideration by the agency in establishing the final rules and regulations for electronic cigarette products.
 From a timing perspective, the process to finalize the deeming regulations may take many months and as long as two years.
 We cannot predict the impact the regulations may have on our company specifically or the electronic cigarette industry generally, and the effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition the regulation will have.
 
In this regard, total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by the FDA under the Tobacco Control Act. Costs, however, could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and ability to market and sell our products. At present, we are not able to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will impact us to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position.
 
State and local governments currently legislate and regulate tobacco products, including what is considered a tobacco product, how tobacco taxes are calculated and collected, to whom and by whom tobacco products can be sold and where tobacco products may or may not be smoked. Certain states and cities have enacted laws which preclude the use of electronic cigarettes where traditional tobacco burning cigarettes cannot be used and others have proposed legislation that would categorize electronic cigarettes as tobacco products, equivalent to their tobacco burning counterparts. If the use of electronic cigarettes is banned anywhere the use of traditional tobacco burning cigarettes is banned, electronic cigarettes may lose their appeal as an alternative to cigarettes; which may have the effect of reducing the demand for our products and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
At present, neither the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (which prohibits the use of the U.S. Postal Service to mail most tobacco products and which amends the Jenkins Act, which would require individuals and businesses that make interstate sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to comply with state tax laws) nor the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed) apply to electronic 
  19

 cigarettes. The application of either or both of these federal laws to electronic cigarettes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
The tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:
 

• | the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.

 In 2016, the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015 went into effect. This legislation requires the packaging of liquid nicotine containers for use in electronic cigarettes to be subject to existing child poisoning prevention packaging standards.
 
"Liquid nicotine container" (1) includes a package from which nicotine in a solution or other form is accessible through normal and foreseeable use by a consumer and that is used to hold soluble nicotine in any concentration; and (2) excludes a sealed, pre-filled, and disposable container of nicotine in a solution or other form in which such container is inserted directly into an electronic cigarette, electronic nicotine delivery system, or other similar product, if the nicotine in the container is inaccessible through customary or reasonably foreseeable handling or use, including reasonably foreseeable ingestion or other contact by children.
 
The definition covers bottles of refillable nicotine-containing e-liquid sold directly to consumers for use in "open-system" electronic vaping devices, but not packaging for zero-nicotine e-liquid, according to a report by The National Law Review.
 
Special packaging requirements also would not apply to "closed-system" e-cigarettes (cigalikes) where the e-liquid is not intended to come into contact with or be handled by the consumer, said the report.
 
The legislation does not limit or preempt the U.S. Food & Drug Administration's (FDA) authority to regulate e-cigarettes, and the FDA would still be empowered to impose its own packaging requirements, the report said.
 
If electronic cigarettes are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiates enacted under the FCTC, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
