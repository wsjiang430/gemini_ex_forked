Who We Are
 Our Mission: We Open Access to Space to Improve Life on Earth.
 Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success. We deliver reliable launch services, spacecraft design services, spacecraft components, spacecraft manufacturing and other spacecraft and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier and more affordable to access space. We believe that space has defined some of humanity’s greatest achievements and it continues to shape our future. We are motivated by the impact we can have on Earth by making it easier to get to space and to use it as a platform for innovation, exploration and infrastructure.
 Unprecedented commercial investment and government expenditures are driving rapid growth in the space economy. As one of select few commercial companies delivering regular access to orbit, our proven launch vehicle, spacecraft technology and global infrastructure uniquely position us to grow this dynamic market. Advances in technologies, materials and components have led to miniaturization of spacecraft and a significant reduction in cost and time-to-market, concurrent with the increase in demand for space applications such as communications, remote sensing, Earth observation, meteorology and navigation. We provide customers with frequent, reliable and cost-effective access to orbit for this new generation of small spacecraft with Electron, a fully carbon composite launch vehicle powered by Rutherford, our electric turbopump 3D printed engines. Since our first Electron launch in 2017 through December 31, 2022, we have delivered 152 spacecraft to space across 29 successful orbital missions for commercial and government customers, including the United States (“U.S.”) Department of Defense (“DoD”), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”) and the National Reconnaissance Office (“NRO”), and a number of domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators including Blacksky Holdings, Canon, Kinéis, Capella Space, Planet, OHB Group and Synspective. In 2022, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and maintained us as the fourth most frequent launcher globally.
 Rocket Lab’s frequent launch cadence has been enabled through innovative manufacturing techniques for Electron, including 3D printing and automation, but production is only part of the formula for frequent and reliable launch. We believe our launch infrastructure is a key part of our success. We currently operate a private launch complex located in Mahia, New Zealand, which we refer to as Launch Complex 1 (“LC-1”). This launch complex is supported by a bi-lateral treaty between the United States and New Zealand governments that enables us to use U.S. launch and spacecraft technology for launches at LC-1 that otherwise would not be permitted for launches from foreign soil. This treaty provides us with a competitive advantage over other companies launching rockets from outside the U.S. that do not have the benefit of such a treaty. Additionally, by operating our own private launch complex, we do not have to share the launch complex with other launch providers and, subject to obtaining required regulatory clearances for launches, have complete control over launch schedule and availability. LC-1 serves as our high-volume launch complex with two operational launch pads following our second launch pad at LC-1 becoming operational in February 2022, capable of supporting up to 120 missions every year. We also operate a dedicated launch pad at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia, which we refer to as Launch Complex 2 (“LC-2”). LC-2 can support 24-hour rapid call-up capability for defense needs and urgent constellation replenishment and is currently licensed to launch 12 missions per year.
 Building on our strong foundation with Electron, we are now developing our Neutron launch vehicle, which we anticipate will have a payload capacity of approximately 15,000 kg for expendable launches to low Earth orbit and lighter payloads for reusable configurations and into higher orbits, and is tailored for large constellation deployments, interplanetary missions and potentially for human spaceflight. We expect constellation missions to make up an increasing percentage of small spacecraft launched, versus bespoke or one-off missions, and Neutron is tailored to meet demand from this growing market.


Consistent with our endeavor to provide end-to-end space solutions or our customers, Rocket Lab has expanded beyond launch services into space systems, delivering diverse spacecraft component solutions, design services, and spacecraft as a service from low Earth orbit constellations to deep space and interplanetary missions for government and commercial customers. Our Space Systems business utilizes our launch services, merchant spacecraft component offerings, spacecraft design services, our family of Photon spacecraft, partnerships with global ground network service providers as well as our own ground station network, and on-orbit constellation management capabilities to provide customers a complete solution that encompasses spacecraft design, build, launch and on-orbit operations.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Our competitive strengths include:
 •Flight Heritage – First Mover Advantage: Electron is the first small launch vehicle to establish frequent and reliable access to space with 29 successful orbital missions and 152 spacecraft deployed through December 31, 2022, and 30 successful missions as of March 7, 2023. Successfully reaching orbit repeatedly and delivering mission success across more than five years of launches demonstrates Electron as a mature launch vehicle, and showcases Rocket Lab’s sophisticated team and robust manufacturing infrastructure and processes. We believe this gives us a significant competitive advantage ahead of potential new market entrants to secure Rocket Lab both higher volume and market share and increasingly higher-value missions from our customers.
 •Unique Technologies: We have innovated around key launch vehicle and spacecraft features and capabilities, including:
 oCarbon composite tanks and structures, delivering substantial mass-savings while maintaining strong structural integrity; 
 oAn electric turbo-pump fed rocket engine that delivers high-performance while removing the complexity associated with traditional gas generator cycle engines;
 oWe believe we were the first company to 3D print an orbital rocket engine, and as of December 31, 2022 have flight heritage with over 350 engines launched to space. We leverage our unique 3D printing capabilities beyond engines, to enable ultra-rapid design and testing of new flight hardware and dramatically shorten our time-to-market; and
 oA unique kick stage that delivers spacecraft to precise and individual orbits increasing deployment flexibility and cost effectiveness for our customers. The kick stage can also be utilized as a fully-featured spacecraft, enabling hosted payload opportunities for our customers and for our own constellation applications.
 •Deep Vertical Integration: We have extensive vertically integrated design and manufacturing capabilities, having developed world-class engineering and manufacturing teams across the United States, New Zealand and Canada. This allows us to manage and control almost every aspect of design, manufacturing and launch operations, enabling rapid prototyping and streamlined production to deliver products and solutions to orbit faster.
 •Integrated Design and Test Capabilities: We own and operate our own propulsion test infrastructure, allowing us the capacity and flexibility to accelerate time-to-market while ensuring quality and a high rate of mission success.
 •Multiple Launch Complexes: Rocket Lab operates two launch pads at its private orbital launch complex, LC-1 in Mahia, New Zealand. This launch complex can support up to 120 launches every year, which is significantly more than the current annual total number of launches from all U.S. spaceports combined. By operating our own private launch complex, we have eliminated the availability issues commonly faced by other launch providers competing for a limited number of slots on shared launch complexes that they do not control. With its inaugural launch at LC-2 in January 2023, Rocket Lab made operational its second launch complex, and third launch pad located at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport within the NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Virginia.
 •A complete end-to-end space solution: Providing services and data from space has traditionally meant relying on multiple suppliers and mission partners. By being able to provide launch services, spacecraft design and manufacturing services, including the vertically integrated supply of key spacecraft components, and on-orbit constellation management services, Rocket Lab provides the strategic keys to space.

Launch Services
 We design, manufacture and launch orbital rockets to deploy payloads across a range of government and commercial missions from low Earth orbit to interplanetary destinations.


Electron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed to accommodate a high launch cadence business model to meet the growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small spacecraft launch services. Combining the use of innovative manufacturing technologies, including 3D printing and automation, Electron is optimized for rapid and frequent launch and has established itself as one of the most prolific and reliable launch vehicles in the market. Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 152 spacecraft to orbit for government and commercial customers across 29 successful orbital missions through December 31, 2022. In 2022, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States, and established Rocket Lab as the fourth most frequent launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry-leading innovations, including 3D printed electric turbo-pump rocket engines, fully carbon composite fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a kick stage that can be configured to convert into a highly capable spacecraft on orbit, and the potential ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability.
 Electron provides tailored access to orbit for the high-growth small spacecraft market across dedicated and rideshare missions. It is capable of deploying spacecraft of up to 300 kg to low Earth orbit across a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 120 degrees from our operational LC-1 in Mahia New Zealand and a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 60 degrees from our operational LC-2 in Wallops Island, Virginia. Electron is also capable of delivering spacecraft to deep space and interplanetary destinations, a capability which we successfully demonstrated with the launch of a NASA mission to the Moon in support of the agency’s Artemis program, Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (“CAPSTONE”). Electron has two primary stages and an innovative third kick stage, standing at 18 meters tall, with a diameter of 1.2 meters and a lift-off mass of approximately 14,000 kg. Electron’s design includes innovative use of avionics and electrical systems, and advanced carbon-composites for its structures and propellant tanks. Carbon-composite construction decreases mass by as much as 40 percent relative to other materials, contributing to Electron’s mass-to-orbit performance. Our in-house assembly of Electron’s composite tanks and structures improves cost efficiency and supports high rates of production. Electron’s kick stage enables the spacecraft to be placed in circular orbits, which is necessary for a spacecraft to maintain consistent altitude and is capable of engine restarts to deliver multiple payloads to a range of orbits, meeting precise orbit insertion requirements, and deorbiting to avoid contributing to orbital debris, also known as space junk.
 Electron is propelled by a total of ten Rutherford engines that we manufacture at our headquarters in Long Beach, California. The Rutherford engine is a 5,600-lbf engine fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene fed by electric turbo-pumps and is based on a propulsion cycle that makes use of electric motors and high-performance lithium polymer batteries to drive liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel pumps. Electric turbo-pumps are lower complexity than the turbomachinery typically required for gas generator cycles, yet still achieve high efficiency. We believe our Rutherford engine is the first oxygen/hydrocarbon engine to use additive manufacturing for all primary components, including the regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, injector pumps and main valves.
 Electron is currently launched from our private launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand and our new launch complex at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops Island, Virginia. As of December 31, 2022, Electron had successfully launched 29 times and deployed 152 spacecraft to orbit.
In March 2021, we announced plans to develop our reusable-ready medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle which will increase the payload capacity of our space launch vehicles to approximately 15,000 kg for expendable launches to low Earth orbit and lighter payloads for reusable configurations and into higher orbits. Neutron will be tailored for commercial and U.S. government constellation launches and ultimately configurable for and capable of human space flight, enabling us to provide crew and cargo resupply to the International Space Station. Neutron will also provide a dedicated service to orbit for larger civil, defense and commercial payloads that need a level of schedule control and high-flight cadence. Neutron is expected to have the capability of launching nearly all of the spacecraft configurations that we expect to be launched through 2029 and we expect to be able to leverage Electron’s flight heritage across various vehicle subsystems designs, launch complexes and ground station infrastructure.
The medium-lift Neutron will be a two-stage launch vehicle that stands 40 meters tall with a 5-meter diameter fairing and a payload capacity of our space launch vehicles to approximately 15,000 kg for expendable launches to low Earth orbit and lighter payloads for reusable configurations and into higher orbits. Neutron will feature a reusable first stage designed to return to launch site as well as land on an ocean platform, enabling flexibility of use, higher launch cadence, and decreased launch costs for customers. Neutron launches are planned to take place from Virginia’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport located at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility. We aim to leverage existing infrastructure at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, with the goal of lessening the incremental investments and accelerating the timeline to first launch, no earlier than the end of 2024.


Space Systems
 Our space systems initiative is supported by the design and manufacture of our Photon family of small spacecraft along with a range of components, software and services for spacecraft, including composite structures, reaction wheels, star trackers, radios, separation systems, solar solutions, command and control spacecraft software, high voltage space-grade battery solutions, and additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. We entered this market with our acquisition of leading spacecraft components manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary, and have since expanded our market participation with the acquisitions of Planetary Systems Corporation, SolAero Holdings, Inc. and aerospace software firm Advanced Solutions, Inc. Each of these strategic acquisitions brought incremental vertically-integrated capabilities for our own Photon family of spacecraft and also enabled Rocket Lab to deliver high-volume manufacturing of critical spacecraft components and software solutions at constellation volume and pricing to the broader spacecraft merchant market. The Photon family of spacecraft enable us to offer an end-to-end mission solution encompassing launch, spacecraft, ground services and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit with Rocket Lab as a single mission partner.
 The Photon family of spacecraft is configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit, and interplanetary missions. Photon is a versatile platform that can be configured to meet a broad range of our customers’ requirements. Photon can be configured to operate as the upper stage of Electron (the kick stage) during launch, then with a simple command it transitions into an operational spacecraft on orbit, eliminating the parasitic mass of deployed spacecraft and enabling full use of the fairing volume for payloads. Photon can also fly on other launch vehicles, such as our in-development Neutron launch vehicle, third party launchers, and as a secondary payload on rockets developed under the National Security Space Launch program of the U.S. Space Force. Our Photon family of spacecraft enable us to offer an end-to-end mission solution encompassing launch, spacecraft, ground services, and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit with Rocket Lab as a single mission partner.
 Our family of Photon spacecraft can be used to conduct space-related scientific research, collect imagery and other remote-sensing data about the Earth, carry out lunar and other deep space planetary missions, and to demonstrate new space technologies. Our family of Photon spacecraft can also be used in combination with Electron to deploy individual spacecraft in different orbital locations and complete constellations in a single mission. Our spacecraft are intended for commercial, defense and civil government customers, including the DoD, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, and governments worldwide. Our first Photon spacecraft was successfully launched and placed into service in August 2020 and a second operational Photon was successfully launched in March 2021. Photon was selected by NASA in 2021 for the CAPSTONE mission, which is a pathfinder for the lunar Gateway initiative of the Artemis program, which involves a mini-space station NASA intends to use as a staging point for crewed lunar landings beginning as soon as 2024. CAPSTONE was deployed on its ballistic lunar transfer trajectory to the Moon in July 2022 and in November 2022 was inserted into it near rectilinear halo orbit as planned. Photon has also been selected for interplanetary missions to Mars and Venus.
 Rocket Lab’s Space Systems business also designs and manufactures a range of spacecraft components, including solar solutions, composite structures, reaction wheels, star trackers, separation systems, software and power systems, and has additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions.
Solar solutions include a suite of vertically-integrated space solar cell, Coverglass Interconnected Cells (“CICs”) and panel products, each specifically designed for missions to low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit or interplanetary applications. Rocket Lab’s space solar cell, CICs and panels are among the highest performing in the world and support civil space exploration, science, defense and intelligence, and commercial markets.
Reaction wheels are motor-driven flywheels used to store angular momentum on a spacecraft. Many spacecraft use three or four reaction wheels to provide agile 3-axis pointing control. Some configurations use a single wheel, called a “momentum wheel,” for stable Earth-pointing control. All Rocket Lab reaction wheels incorporate an onboard digital processor with speed and torque control loops. Wheels are sized by their maximum angular momentum measured in Newton-meters (“Nm”). We make a large number of different wheel sizes, ranging from 3 mNm to 12 Nms. Bigger spacecraft require bigger and more costly wheels, with determination of the correct size of wheel for a particular spacecraft requiring detailed engineering analysis.
Star trackers are optical sensors that determine the spacecraft’s pointing direction and rotation rate by looking at the stars. Our star trackers are fully integrated units, where one box includes the lens, detector, processor, and all of the power supply and support circuits. A catalog of more than two million possible star triangles is loaded before launch, allowing the processor to determine the direction from any single image.
 Power systems include both the high-capacity high-voltage batteries used to power the electric turbo-pumps in the Rutherford rocket engine used by Electron and other batteries used for small spacecraft.

Separation systems including motorized lightband and canisterized spacecraft dispensers (“CSD”), which are used to separate spacecraft from the launch platform into orbit. The motorized lightband is a ringed system with sizes from 8-inches in diameter up to 62-inches in diameter. Lightband’s deploy spacecraft via motors and a mechanical linkage. The CSD is a reliable and cost-effective housing for small spacecraft that protects a spacecraft during launch and deploys them in space. Fully encapsulated, the CSD minimizes damage risk and eliminates the necessity for heavy or complicated interface structures between the spacecraft and launch vehicle platform.

 We utilize strategic marketing to accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness. Rocket Lab has established a strong brand through various activities, including:
 •conferences and industry events at which we participate, sponsor, exhibit and speak;
 •press releases and media engagement;
 •social media postings;


•merchandising;
 •cooperative marketing efforts with customers; and
 •communicating our differentiated selling points and product features through marketing collateral such as our website, payload user guides, product data sheets, presentations, and high-quality launch webcasts and videos.
 To date, conferences and industry events and direct outreach have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales with relatively low marketing costs.
 Engineering
 We have made significant investments in our engineering teams. Our team members have a broad range of expertise from a range of industries including; aerospace, automotive, and marine, and broader manufacturing and technology. Rocket Lab’s high level of vertical integration means that these engineering teams design and provide manufacturing support for components, sub-systems, and assemblies across the full range of our launch vehicles, and Photon family of spacecraft. They support the full product lifecycle from new product innovation to sustaining engineering, including payload lift capacity increases and other performance improvements, to new product features such as booster reusability and cost reduction initiatives.
 Our engineering teams across New Zealand, the United States, and Canada address all key areas of launch vehicle build, payload integration, launch operations, ground segment communications, on orbit spacecraft operations management, and spacecraft component design and manufacturing. Key areas of technical focus include composite structures, additive manufacturing, machining, avionics and power systems, propulsion assembly and test, spacecraft system design assembly and test, solar cell foundry through panel design and manufacturing, printed circuit-board design, optics integration, guidance and navigation, attitude direction and command and control, amongst other engineering focus areas.
 These teams are supported by centralized planning and program management functions that guide significant projects across Rocket Lab for consistency and visibility. We leverage sophisticated product lifecycle management software tools, computer-aided design systems and business processes to drive efficiency and better manage the entire product lifecycle, including designing, sourcing and building the products that enable our launch services and end-product deliveries.
 Supply Chain
 We are highly vertically integrated, in that we design and manufacture many components and subsystems for our launch vehicles, Photon family of spacecraft, and spacecraft components we sell into the merchant market. To support this level of vertical integration we have developed extensive supply chain operations and capabilities that are global in nature and enabled by sophisticated third-party enterprise resource planning systems and tools. These systems and tools are largely supported by an in-house team of enterprise information systems personnel.
 We obtain raw materials, components, sub-systems and capital equipment, and other supplies from suppliers that we believe to be reputable and reliable. We have established and follow internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering engineering validation, quality, cost, delivery and lead-time. We have a quality management team that is responsible for managing and ensuring that supplied components meet quality standards. While we largely source raw materials and other inputs and services from multiple sources, in some cases we also purchase various inputs and services from a sole source. In those sole source supplier situations, as we endeavor to diversify our supply chain, we manage this sole source risk through carrying increased buffer stock, particularly on long-lead items.
 Manufacturing, Assembly and Launch Operations
 Rocket Lab conducts global operations in support of its research and development manufacturing, assembly and launch operations. We have our Rutherford engines and avionics manufacturing facilities in Long Beach, California, composite manufacturing, high-voltage battery systems, launch vehicle integration and propulsion testing in Auckland, New Zealand, space solar cell through panel production in Albuquerque, New Mexico and launch complexes in Mahia, New Zealand and Wallops Island, Virginia.

 LC-2 represents a new responsive launch capability within the United States. The complex was designed to support both commercial and U.S. government launch services and once operational is licensed to support 12 missions per year. The site can support launches to inclinations between 38 and 60 degrees. In addition to the dedicated launch pad for Electron, Rocket Lab also operates an Integration and Control Facility within the Wallops Research Park. This facility is dedicated to secure vehicle and payload processing facilities. The facility can process several Electron launch vehicles and customer spacecraft concurrently, enabling rapid and responsive launch opportunities and parallel launch campaigns. We have built out all of the physical infrastructure that we need in order to use this launch complex and on January 24, 2023, we successfully launched our first Electron from NASA Wallops Flight Facility.
Albuquerque, New Mexico Solar Cell Production Facility
 Our solar cell through panel production activities are conducted out of our Albuquerque, New Mexico facility. From this location we conduct research and development and design and manufacturing of solar cell production. We conduct these operations at two nearby leased buildings comprising an approximately 160,000 square foot production and research and development complex in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We have a ground lease for one building that expires on September 18, 2050 and the lease on the second building that expires on May 31, 2042.

 Intellectual Property
 The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.
 As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 200 issued U.S. patents and more than 90 issued foreign patents. Our U.S. issued patents expire between 2026 and 2040. As of December 31, 2022, we held approximately 12 registered trademarks in the United States, including the Rocket Lab mark, and also held approximately 22 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,400 full-time permanent employees across the globe. We believe the positive relationship we have with our employees and our strong culture of collaboration and innovation differentiate us and are key drivers of our business success. Our employees are not subject to collective bargaining agreements.
Culture
 At Rocket Lab we strive to emphasize a culture where we work hard and bond together. As an example, this competitive and celebratory spirit is best on display during our annual Rocket Challenge and employee awards. Blended teams across the company’s divisions put down their tools, pick up craft supplies and hot glue, and get together across Rocket Lab’s sites to quickly build and launch the competition’s most impressive new small rocket. Quick thinking, innovative craftsmanship, and camaraderie are core to the competition, and hovercrafts, propulsive boats, planes, and helicopters have all been the result. The day is finished with honoring Rocket Lab staff with exclusive long service Rocket Lab aerospace coins, and by celebrating the winners of Rocket Lab’s annual staff award alongside hundreds of Rocket Lab employees. Competition is especially high for employees with the technological skills and experience necessary to support our business, and we believe this culture and employee experience enhances our ability to recruit and retain employees and keep them engaged in the interesting work that supports our mission.
Safety
 Rocket Lab has robust health and safety policies, systems, and processes across the business to enable a safe working environment. Supported by the executive leadership team, Rocket Lab employees are empowered to make decisions and take steps to ensure they maintain a safe and healthy workplace for themselves, colleagues and our business.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 Diversity unlocks innovation. Different experiences, knowledge, and cultures come together to generate new ways of doing things and new ideas, and we’re committed to attracting and engaging a global team that reflects the diversity of the missions we launch and the communities where we live and work. At the internship level, Rocket Lab has set a target of 50% women in its annual internship intake. Rocket Lab is also a host institution for the Brooke Owens Fellowship, which provides paid internships and executive mentorship for undergraduate women and gender-minority students in aerospace. Our workplace culture places priority on people feeling welcomed, valued, and respected, and we’ve backed this commitment with goals, policies, and initiatives to increase women and minority hires throughout our teams.
Talent
 Our Rocket Lab team members are incredibly talented. Our success has come from doing things differently by highly-capable people with various experiences, and so our talent strategy focuses on growing from within. Rocket Lab provides leadership training opportunities across the company, including external courses, tailored specifically for women moving into leadership positions. We continue to have a strong focus on promoting internally where we can and supporting staff early in their careers in their ambition to grow and take on more challenging work.

Risk Factors Summary
 You should carefully read the risks described below, this Annual Report on Form 10-K and especially consider the factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to:
 •We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and those growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.
 •We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to forecast our revenue, plan our expenses and evaluate our business and future prospects.
 •We have a history of losses, we anticipate increasing operating expenses and capital expenditures in the future, and we may not be able to achieve and, if ever achieved, maintain profitability.
 •Our future revenue and operating results are dependent on our ability to generate a sustainable order rate for our products and services and develop new technologies to meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers.
 •Our business with various governmental entities is subject to the policies, priorities, regulations, mandates and funding levels of such governmental entities and may be negatively or positively impacted by any change thereto.
 •We derive a substantial amount of our revenues from only a few of our customers. A loss of, or default by, one or more of these major customers, or a material adverse change in any such customer’s business or financial condition, could materially reduce our future revenues and contracted backlog.
 •Disruptions in U.S. government operations and funding could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.
 •We may not be successful in developing new technology, including our Neutron launch vehicle and the technology we are successful in developing may not meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers.
 •We operate in highly competitive industries and in various jurisdictions across the world which may cause us to have to reduce our prices.
 •Disruptions in the supply of key raw materials or components and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, as well as increases in prices of raw materials, could adversely impact us.
 •Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 •We often rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 •Launch vehicles are subject to manufacturing delays, damage or destruction during pre-launch operations, and launch failures, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations.
 •Spacecraft are subject to manufacturing and launch delays, damage or destruction during pre-launch operations, launch failures and incorrect orbital placement, the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations.
 •If our launch vehicles and spacecraft fail to operate as intended, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 •Our revenue, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted if our products contain defects or fail to operate in the expected manner.
 •Any inability to operate Electron at our anticipated launch rate could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 •The expansion of our operations subjects us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.
 •Acquisitions or divestitures could result in adverse impacts on our operations.
 •Space is a harsh and unpredictable environment where our products and service offerings are exposed to a wide and unique range of environmental risks, including, among others, coronal mass ejections, solar flares and other extreme space weather events and potential collision with space debris or another spacecraft, which could adversely affect our launch vehicle and spacecraft performance.


•Increased congestion from the proliferation of low Earth orbit constellations could materially increase the risks of potential collision with space debris or another spacecraft and limit or impair our launch flexibility and/or access to our own orbital slots.
 •Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance.
 •Interruption or failure of our infrastructure could hurt our ability to effectively perform our daily operations and provide and produce our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.
 •Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, or theft or tampering of intellectual property, any of which could materially adversely impact our business.
 •We are unable to predict the extent to which epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks, including the global COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely impact our business operations, across our global footprint, financial performance, results of operations and stock price.
 •If we cannot successfully protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer.
 •Our technology may violate the proprietary rights of third parties, which could have a negative impact on our operations.
 •We are highly dependent on the services of Peter Beck, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and if we are unable to retain Mr. Beck, our ability to compete could be harmed.
 •Our inability to hire or retain key personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
 •Labor-related matters, including labor disputes, may adversely affect our operations.
 •Given the relative contribution and materiality of our New Zealand operations, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or future hedging activities could have a negative impact on our business.
 •We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on company favorable terms, if at all, or may be available only by diluting existing stockholders.
 •As a private company, prior to the Business Combination, we were not required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting nor had our management been required to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls and our auditors have not been required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. Although we believe these material weaknesses have been remediated, we cannot provide assurances that additional material weaknesses, or significant deficiencies, will not occur in the future, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.
 •A significant portion of our management team has limited experience managing a public company.
