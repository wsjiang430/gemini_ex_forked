On October 23, 2018, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Hamilton Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for Hamilton Bank, based in Towson, Maryland. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, the approval of Hamilton's shareholders, and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. If completed, the Hamilton acquisition will expand the Company's presence into the greater Baltimore, Maryland, market.
Business
The Bank was originally organized in 1919 as a state-chartered bank. On March 8, 1988, in a bank holding company reorganization transaction, the Parent Company acquired 100% ownership of the Bank.
The Parent Company’s primary activity consists of owning and supervising its subsidiaries, the Bank and Wheatland. Day-to-day management is conducted by its officers, who are also Bank officers. The Parent Company has historically derived most of its income through dividends from the Bank. At December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $1,934,388,000, total deposits of $1,558,756,000 and total shareholders’ equity of $173,433,000.
The Parent Company has no employees. Its 10 officers are employees of the Bank. On December 31, 2018, the Bank and Wheatland combined had 367 full-time and 19 part-time employees.
The Bank is engaged in the commercial banking and trust business as authorized by the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965. This involves accepting demand, time and savings deposits, and granting loans. The Bank holds commercial, residential, consumer and agribusiness loans primarily in its market areas of Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Perry and York Counties in Pennsylvania; Washington County, Maryland; and in contiguous counties. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are included in Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The Bank maintains a diversified loan portfolio and evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon the extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer pursuant to collateral standards established in the Bank’s credit policies and procedures.
Wheatland supplements the Bank's trust and wealth management group and is anticipated to provide opportunities for future growth in these areas. 
Lending
All secured loans are supported with appraisals or evaluations of collateral. Business equipment and machinery, inventories, accounts receivable, and farm equipment are considered appropriate security, provided borrowers meet acceptable standards for liquidity and marketability. Loans secured by real estate generally do not exceed 90% of the appraised value of the property. Loan to collateral values are monitored as part of the loan review process, and appraisals are updated as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.
Commercial Lending
A majority of the Company’s loan assets are loans for business purposes. Approximately 62% of the loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans. The Bank makes commercial real estate, equipment, working capital and other commercial purpose loans as required by the broad range of borrowers across the Bank’s various markets.
The Bank’s credit policy dictates the underwriting requirements for the various types of loans the Bank would extend to borrowers. The policy covers such requirements as debt coverage ratios, advance rates against different forms of collateral, loan-to-value ratios and maximum term.
Consumer Lending
The Bank provides home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans primarily through its branch network and customer call center. A large majority of the consumer loans are secured by either a first or second lien position on the borrower’s primary residential real estate. The Bank requires a loan-to-value ratio of no greater than 90% of the value of the real estate being taken as collateral. We also, at times, purchase consumer loans to help diversify credit risk in our loan portfolio. 
Residential Lending
The Bank provides residential mortgages throughout its various markets through a network of mortgage loan officers. A majority of the residential mortgages originated are sold to secondary market investors, primarily Wells Fargo, Fannie Mae and

 the FHLB of Pittsburgh. All mortgages, regardless of being sold or held in the Bank’s portfolio, are generally underwritten to secondary market industry standards for prime mortgages. The Bank generally requires a loan-to-value ratio of no greater than 80% of the value of the real estate being taken as collateral, without the borrower obtaining private mortgage insurance.
Loan Review
The Bank has a loan review policy and program which is designed to identify and monitor risk in the lending function. The ERM Committee, comprised of executive officers and loan department personnel, is charged with the oversight of overall credit quality and risk exposure of the Bank’s loan portfolio. This includes the monitoring of the lending activities of all Bank personnel with respect to underwriting and processing new loans and the timely follow-up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality. The loan review program provides the Bank with an independent review of the Bank’s commercial loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in Pass categories unless a specific action, such as extended delinquencies, bankruptcy, repossession, or death of the borrower occurs, which heightens awareness as to a possible credit event.
Internal loan reviews are completed annually on all commercial relationships with a committed loan balance in excess of $500,000, which includes confirmation of risk rating by an independent credit officer. In addition, all relationships greater than $250,000 rated Substandard, Doubtful or Loss are reviewed quarterly and corresponding risk ratings are reaffirmed by the Bank's Problem Loan Committee, with subsequent reporting to the ERM Committee.
The Bank outsources its independent loan review to a third-party provider, which monitors and evaluates loan customers on a quarterly basis utilizing risk-rating criteria established in the credit policy in order to identify deteriorating trends and detect conditions which might indicate potential problem loans. The results of the third-party loan review are reported quarterly to the ERM Committee for approval. The loan ratings provide the basis for evaluating the adequacy of the ALL.
Investment Services
Through its trust department, the Bank renders services as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, managing agent, custodian, investment advisor, and other fiduciary activities authorized by law under the trade name "Orrstown Financial Advisors." OFA offers retail brokerage services through a third-party broker/dealer arrangement with Cetera Advisor Networks LLC. Wheatland also offers investment advisor services as a registered investment advisor. At December 31, 2018, assets under management by OFA and Wheatland totaled $1,330,595,000.
Regulation and Supervision
The Parent Company is a bank holding company registered with the FRB and has elected status as a financial holding company. As a registered bank holding company and FHC, the Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and to inspection, examination, and supervision by the FRB.
The Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank and a member of the FRB. The operations of the Bank are subject to federal and state statutes applicable to banks chartered under Pennsylvania law, to FRB member banks and to banks whose deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank’s operations are also subject to regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the FRB and the FDIC.
Wheatland is subject to periodic examination by the SEC.
Several of the more significant regulatory provisions applicable to bank holding companies and banks to which the Company and the Bank are subject are discussed below, along with certain regulatory matters concerning the Company and the Bank. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, such information is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutes or regulations. Any change in applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank.
Financial and Bank Holding Company Activities
As an FHC, we are permitted to engage, directly or through subsidiaries, in a wide variety of activities that are financial in nature or are incidental or complementary to a financial activity, in addition to all of the activities otherwise allowed to us. 
As an FHC, the Company is generally subject to the same regulation as other bank holding companies, including the reporting, examination, supervision and consolidated capital requirements of the FRB. To preserve our FHC status, we must remain well-capitalized and well-managed and ensure that the Bank remains well-capitalized and well-managed for regulatory purposes and earns “satisfactory” or better ratings on its periodic Community Reinvestment Act examinations. An FHC ceasing to meet these standards is subject to a variety of restrictions, depending on the circumstances. 
Table of Contents

If the Parent Company or the Bank are either not well-capitalized or not well-managed, the Parent Company or the Bank must promptly notify the FRB. Until compliance is restored, the FRB has broad discretion to impose appropriate limitations on an FHC’s activities. If compliance is not restored within 180 days, the FRB may ultimately require the FHC to divest its depository institutions or in the alternative, to discontinue or divest any activities that are permitted only to non-FHC bank holding companies. 
If the FRB determines that an FHC or its subsidiaries do not satisfy the CRA requirements, the potential restrictions are different. In that case, until all the subsidiary institutions are restored to at least “satisfactory” CRA rating status, the FHC may not engage, directly or through a subsidiary, in any of the additional activities permissible under the BHC Act nor make additional acquisitions of companies engaged in the additional activities. However, completed acquisitions and additional activities and affiliations previously begun are left undisturbed, as the BHC Act does not require divestiture for this type of situation. 
Federal Financial Regulatory Reform
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2010, substantially increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and imposed additional costs and risks on the operations of financial holding companies and banks. 
The Dodd-Frank Act materially changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry and created a framework for regulatory reform. The Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder, some of which are still being drafted and implemented, include provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that affect the regulation of community banks and bank holding companies. 
The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed new capital requirements on bank holding companies; changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base; permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expanded the FDIC’s authority to raise insurance premiums. The legislation also called for the FDIC to raise its ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to “offset the effect” of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also included provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary trading by banking organizations, places restrictions on the owning or sponsoring of hedge and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify threats to the financial stability of the U.S., promote market discipline, and respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent entity funded by the FRB. The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB’s rules contain provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, and determinations as to a borrower’s ability to repay, loan servicing, and prepayment penalties. The CFPB has primary examination and enforcement authority over banks with over $10 billion in assets as to consumer financial products. 
One of the announced goals of the CFPB is to bring greater consumer protection to the mortgage servicing market. The CFPB has defined a “qualified mortgage” for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act, and set standards for mortgage lenders to determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay the mortgage. It has also issued regulations affording safe harbor legal protections for lenders making qualified loans that are not “higher priced.” The CFPB's regulations contain new mortgage servicing rules applicable to the Bank, which took effect in 2014. Changes affect notices to be given to consumers as to delinquency, foreclosure alternatives, modification applications, interest rate adjustments and options for avoiding “force-placed” insurance. Servicers are prohibited from processing foreclosures when a loan modification is pending, and must wait until a loan is more than 120 days delinquent before initiating a foreclosure action. 
The servicer must provide direct and ongoing access to its personnel, and provide prompt review of any loss mitigation application. Servicers must maintain accurate and accessible mortgage records for the life of a loan and until one year after the loan is paid off or transferred. 
The Bank presently services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans which it owns or originated, so it is considered a “Small Servicer” and is exempt from certain parts of the mortgage servicing rules. The mortgage servicing requirements applicable to the Bank’s servicing operations under the new mortgage servicing rules are: adjustable rate mortgage interest rate adjustment notices; prompt payment crediting and payoff statements; limits on force-placed insurance; responses to written information requests and complaints of errors; and loss mitigation with regard to the first notice or filing for a foreclosure and no foreclosure proceedings if a borrower is performing pursuant to the terms of a loss mitigation agreement.

Federal Deposit Insurance
The Bank’s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. The maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 under the Dodd-Frank Act.
The FDIC is required by the Dodd-Frank Act to return its insurance reserve ratio to 1.35% no later than September 30, 2020. When the fund reached 1.15%, banks larger than $10 billion in assets were required to assume the burden of bringing the fund to 1.35%. In 2016, the fund reached the 1.15% ratio and smaller banks' assessments decreased. In September 2018, the fund reached 1.36%, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. FDIC regulations provide for two changes to deposit insurance assessments upon reaching the minimum: (1) surcharges on insured large banks will cease; and (2) small banks will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%. At December 31, 2018, the reserve ratio did not exceed 1.38 percent.
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC changed its calculation of FDIC insurance premiums. Institutions are now assigned a base rate using their examination ratings, which is then adjusted based on their leverage ratio, net income before taxes to total assets ratio, nonperforming loans and leases to gross assets ratio, other real estate owned to gross assets ratio, loan mix index, and one-year asset growth rate. The result is then further adjusted to reflect its level of unsecured debt issued, the level of unsecured depository institution debt it owns, and the level of brokered deposits (excluding reciprocal deposits) it has issued above regulatory minimums.
If the FDIC is appointed conservator or receiver of a bank upon the bank’s insolvency or the occurrence of other events, the FDIC may sell some, part or all of a bank’s assets and liabilities to another bank or repudiate or disaffirm most types of contracts to which the bank was a party if the FDIC believes such contracts are burdensome. In resolving the estate of a failed bank, the FDIC as receiver will first satisfy its own administrative expenses, and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities also have priority over those of other general unsecured creditors. 
Liability for Banking Subsidiaries
Under the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable FRB policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to their support. This support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide it. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), the FDIC can hold any FDIC-insured depository institution liable for any loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the “default” of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution; or any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution “in danger of default.”
Pennsylvania Banking Law
The Pennsylvania Banking Code (“Banking Code”) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rule-making power and administrative discretion to the PDB so that the supervision and regulation of state chartered banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices.
The FDIA, however, prohibits state chartered banks from making new investments, loans, or becoming involved in activities as principal and equity investments which are not permitted for national banks unless the FDIC determines the activity or investment does not pose a significant risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund; and the bank meets all applicable capital requirements. Accordingly, the additional operating authority provided to the Bank by the Banking Code is significantly restricted by the FDIA.
Dividend Restrictions
The Parent Company’s funding for cash distributions to its shareholders is derived from a variety of sources, including cash and temporary investments. One of the principal sources of those funds has historically been dividends received from the Bank. Various federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Parent Company without regulatory approval. In addition, federal bank regulatory agencies have authority to prohibit the Bank from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. The payment of dividends, depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends in the future may be influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines.

Regulatory Capital Requirements
Compliance by the Company and the Bank with respect to capital requirements is incorporated by reference from Note 15, Shareholders' Equity and Regulatory Capital, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," and from the Capital Adequacy and Regulatory Matters section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Basel III Capital Rules
The Company and the Bank are subject to the Basel III Capital Rules, which prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories than previously used, depending on the nature of the assets. These categories generally range from 0%, for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600%, for certain equity exposures, and result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 
The Basel III Capital Rules incorporate a capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1 and a related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets and a “capital conservation buffer,” designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer are subject to constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The capital standards were fully phased-in and fully implemented on January 1, 2019. Those applicable to the Parent Company and the Bank include an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%.
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized from net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in unconsolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. Under a one-time permanent election made by the Company and the Bank, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items are not excluded from regulatory capital, including unrealized gains or losses on certain securities available for sale. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 were phased in and fully implemented beginning January 1, 2018.
Other Federal Laws and Regulations
The Company’s operations are subject to additional federal laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions, including, without limitation:
•Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, which require us to maintain privacy policies intended to safeguard customer financial information, to disclose the policies to our customers and to allow customers to “opt out” of having their financial service providers disclose their confidential financial information to non-affiliated third parties, subject to certain exceptions;
•Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
•Consumer protection rules for the sale of insurance products by depository institutions, adopted pursuant to the requirements of the GLB Act; and
•the USA PATRIOT Act, which requires financial institutions to take certain actions to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Future Legislation and Regulation
Changes in federal laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations in states where the Parent Company and the Bank do business, can affect the operating environment of the Company and the Bank in substantial ways. We cannot predict whether those changes in laws and regulations will occur, and, if they occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. 
NASDAQ Capital Market
The Company’s common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol “ORRF” and is subject to NASDAQ’s rules for listed companies.

Competition
The Bank’s principal market area consists of Berks County, Cumberland County, Dauphin County, Franklin County, Lancaster County, Perry County, and York County, Pennsylvania, and Washington County, Maryland. The Bank serves a substantial number of depositors in this market area and contiguous counties, with the greatest concentration in Chambersburg, Shippensburg, and Carlisle, Pennsylvania and the surrounding areas. 
We are subject to robust competition in our market areas. Like other depository institutions, we compete with less heavily regulated entities such as credit unions, brokerage firms, money market funds, consumer finance and credit card companies, and with other commercial banks, many of which are larger than the Bank. The principal methods of competing effectively in the financial services industry include improving customer service through the quality and range of services provided, improving efficiencies and pricing services competitively. The Bank is competitive with the financial institutions in its service areas with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans.
We continue to implement strategic initiatives focused on expanding our core businesses and to explore, on an ongoing basis, acquisition, divestiture, and joint venture opportunities to the extent permitted by our regulators. We analyze each of our products and businesses in the context of shareholder return, customer demands, competitive advantages, industry dynamics, and growth potential. We believe our market area will support growth in assets and deposits in the future, which we expect to contribute to our ability to maintain or grow profitability.
