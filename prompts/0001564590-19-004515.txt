ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

 Primerica, Inc. (“Primerica”, “we”, “us” or the “Parent Company”) is a leading provider of financial products to middle-income households in the United States and Canada with 130,736 licensed sales representatives as of December 31, 2018. This network of independent contractor sales representatives (“sales representatives” or “sales force”) assists our clients in meeting their needs for term life insurance, which we underwrite, and mutual funds, annuities, managed investments and other financial products, which we distribute primarily on behalf of third parties. We insured approximately five million lives and have over two million client investment accounts as of December 31, 2018. Our distribution model uniquely positions us to reach underserved middle-income consumers in a cost-effective manner and has proven itself in both favorable and challenging economic environments.
 Our mission is to serve middle-income families by helping them make informed financial decisions and providing them with a strategy and tools to gain financial independence. Our distribution model is designed to:
  
• | Address our clients’ financial needs. Licensed sales representatives primarily use our proprietary financial needs analysis tool (“FNA”) and an educational approach to demonstrate how our product offerings can assist clients to provide financial protection for their families, save for their retirement and other needs, and manage their debt. Typically, our clients are the friends, family members and personal acquaintances of sales representatives. Meetings are generally held in informal, face-to-face settings, usually in the clients’ homes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide a business opportunity. We provide an entrepreneurial business opportunity for individuals to distribute financial products. Low entry fees as well as the ability to select their own schedules and time commitments allow sales representatives to supplement their income by starting their own independent businesses without leaving their current jobs. Our unique compensation structure, technology, sales support and back-office processing are designed to enable sales representatives to successfully grow their independent businesses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe there is significant opportunity to meet the increasing array of financial services needs of our clients.  We intend to leverage the sales force to meet such client needs, which will drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders.  Our strategy is organized across four primary areas: 
  
• | Maximizing sales force growth, leadership and productivity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broadening and strengthening our protection product portfolio;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing offerings that enhance our Investment and Savings Products (“ISP”) business; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing digital capabilities to deepen our client relationships.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Corporate Structure
 We conduct our core business activities in the United States through three principal entities, all of which are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Parent Company:

• | Primerica Financial Services, LLC (“PFS”), our general agency and marketing company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Primerica Life Insurance Company (“Primerica Life”), our principal life insurance underwriting company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PFS Investments Inc. (“PFS Investments”), our investment and savings products company, broker-dealer and registered investment advisor.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Primerica Life is domiciled in Tennessee, and its wholly owned subsidiary, National Benefit Life Insurance Company (“NBLIC”), is a New York-domiciled life insurance underwriting company.   
 We conduct our core business activities in Canada through three principal entities, all of which are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Parent Company:
  
• | Primerica Life Insurance Company of Canada (“Primerica Life Canada”), our Canadian life insurance underwriting company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PFSL Investments Canada Ltd. (“PFSL Investments Canada”), our Canadian licensed mutual fund dealer; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PFSL Fund Management Ltd. (“PFSL Fund Management”), our Canadian investment funds manager.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Primerica was incorporated in the United States as a Delaware corporation in October 2009 to serve as a holding company for the Primerica businesses (collectively, the “Company”). Our businesses, which prior to April 1, 2010, were wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of Citigroup Inc. (“Citigroup”), were transferred to us by Citigroup on April 1, 2010 in a reorganization pursuant to which we completed an initial public offering in April 2010 (the “IPO”). On March 31, 2010, we entered into certain coinsurance transactions to cede between 80% and 90% of the risks and rewards of our term life insurance policies that were in force at year-end 2009. We administer all policies subject to these coinsurance agreements.

Our Clients
 Our clients are generally middle-income consumers, which we define as households with $30,000 to $100,000 of annual income. According to the 2017 U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey, the latest period for which data is available, almost 50% of U.S. households fall in this range. We believe that we understand the financial needs of the middle-income segment, which include:

• | Many have inadequate or no life insurance coverage. Individual life insurance sales in the United States declined from 12.5 million policy sales in 1975 to 9.8 million policy sales in 2017, the latest period for which data is available, according to the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association International, Inc. (“LIMRA”), a worldwide association of insurance and financial services companies. We believe that term life insurance, which we have provided to middle-income clients for many years, is generally the best option for them to meet their life insurance needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Many need help saving for retirement and other personal goals. Many middle-income families find it challenging to save for retirement and other personal goals. By developing personalized savings programs for our clients using our proprietary FNA and offering a wide range of mutual funds, annuities, managed investments and segregated fund products sponsored and managed by established firms, sales representatives are well equipped to help clients develop long-term savings plans to address their financial needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Many need to reduce their debt. Many middle-income families have numerous debt obligations from credit cards, auto loans, and home mortgages. We help our clients address these financial burdens by providing personalized and client-driven debt resolution techniques.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Many prefer to meet face-to-face when considering financial products. Historically, many middle-income consumers have indicated a preference to meet face-to-face when considering financial products or services. As such, we have designed our distribution model to address this preference in a cost-effective manner through a network of more than 130,000 life insurance-licensed sales representatives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Distribution Model
 Our distribution model, which is a modified traditional insurance agency model, is designed to reach and serve middle-income consumers efficiently through the sales force. Key characteristics of our unique distribution model include:

• | Independent entrepreneurs: Sales representatives are independent contractors building and operating their own businesses. This approach means that sales representatives are entrepreneurs who take responsibility for selling products, recruiting and developing sales representatives, setting their own schedules and managing and paying the administrative expenses associated with their sales activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible time commitment: By offering a flexible time commitment opportunity, we are able to attract a significant number of recruits who desire to earn supplemental income and generally concentrate on smaller-sized transactions typical of middle-income consumers. Sales representatives are able to start their independent businesses for low entry fees, for which they receive technological support, pre-licensing training and access to licensing examination preparation programs. Sales representatives sell or refer products directly to consumers, and therefore our business opportunity does not require recruits to purchase and resell our products. Most sales representatives begin selling products on a part-time basis, which enables them to hold jobs while exploring an entrepreneurial business opportunity with us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Incentive to build distribution: When a sale is made, the selling representative receives a commission, as does the licensed representative who recruited him or her in most cases. Sales commissions are paid through several levels of the selling representative’s recruitment organization. This structure motivates existing sales representatives to grow the sales force and provides them with commission income from the sales completed by representatives in their sales organizations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sales force leadership: A sales representative who has built a successful organization and has obtained his or her life insurance and securities licenses can achieve the sales designation of Regional Vice President (“RVP”), which qualifies him or her for a higher commission schedule. RVPs are independent contractors who open and operate offices for their sales organizations and devote their full-time attention to their businesses. RVPs also support and monitor the sales representatives, on whose sales they earn commissions, in achieving compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. RVPs’ efforts to expand their businesses are a primary driver of our success.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Innovative compensation structure: We have developed an innovative system for compensating the sales force that is contingent upon product sales. We advance to sales representatives a significant portion of their insurance commissions upon their submission of an insurance application and the first month’s premium payment. In addition to being a source of motivation, this advance provides sales representatives with immediate cash flow to offset their costs. In addition, monthly production bonuses are paid to RVPs whose sales organizations meet certain sales levels. With compensation tied to sales activity, our approach accommodates varying degrees of individual productivity, which allows us to effectively use a large group of part-time sales representatives while providing a variable cost structure. In addition, we incentivize RVPs with quarterly stock awards based largely on sales production (“agent equity awards”), which aligns their interests with those of our stockholders.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large, dynamic sales force: Members of the sales force primarily serve their friends, family members and personal acquaintances through individually driven networking activities. We believe that this warm market approach is an effective way to distribute our product offerings because it facilitates face-to-face interaction initiated by a trusted acquaintance of the prospective client, which is difficult to replicate using other distribution approaches. Due to the large size of the sales force and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2

 
the active recruiting of new sales representatives, the sales force is able to continually access an expanding base of prospective clients without engaging costly media channels.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Motivational culture: In addition to the motivation for sales representatives to achieve financial success, we seek to create a culture that inspires and rewards sales representatives for their personal successes and those of their sales organizations through sales force recognition events and contests. We also use Intranet-streamed broadcasts and local, regional and national meetings to inform and teach sales representatives, as well as facilitate camaraderie and the exchange of ideas across the sales force. These initiatives encourage and empower sales representatives to develop their own successful sales organizations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inclusive culture: Building and maintaining an ethnically and demographically diverse sales force is important to us, as we believe the sales force reflects the middle market communities we serve. As the communities we serve become more diverse, the sales force does as well. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Structure and Scalability of the Sales Force
 New sales representatives are recruited by existing sales representatives. When these new recruits become sales representatives, they become part of the sales organization of the sales representative who recruited them as well as the sales organizations to which the recruiting sales representative belongs. We encourage sales representatives to bring in new recruits to build their own sales organizations, enabling them to earn commissions on sales made by members of their sales organizations.
 RVPs establish and maintain their own offices, which we refer to as field offices. Additionally, they are responsible for funding the costs of their administrative staff, marketing materials, travel, training and certain recognition events for the sales representatives in their respective sales organizations. Field offices provide a location for sales representatives to conduct recruiting meetings, training events and sales-related meetings, disseminate our Intranet-streamed broadcasts, conduct compliance functions, and house field office business records. Some business locations house more than one field office. At December 31, 2018, approximately 5,200 field offices in 2,917 locations were managed by sales representatives that served as RVPs. 
 RVPs play a major role in training, motivating and monitoring their sales force organization. Because the sales representative’s compensation grows with the productivity of his or her sales organization, our distribution model provides financial rewards to sales representatives who successfully develop, support and monitor productive sales representatives. In addition to our commission structure, we offer the Primerica Ownership Program. This program provides qualifying RVPs a contractual right, upon meeting certain criteria, to transfer their Primerica businesses to another RVP or a qualifying family member at such time as they desire. Furthermore, we have developed proprietary tools and technology to enable RVPs to reduce the time spent on administrative responsibilities associated with their sales organizations so they can devote more time to the sales, recruiting and training activities that drive our growth. We believe that our tools and technology, coupled with our sales compensation programs, further incentivize sales representatives to become RVPs.
 Both the structure of the sales force and the capacity of our support capabilities provide us with a high degree of scalability as we grow our business. Our support systems and technology are capable of supporting a large sales force and a high volume of transactions. In addition, by sharing training and compliance activities with RVPs, we are able to grow without incurring proportionate overhead expenses. 
 Recruitment of Sales Representatives
 The recruitment of sales representatives is undertaken by existing sales representatives, who identify prospects and share with them the benefits of associating with our organization. Sales representatives showcase our organization as dynamic and capable of improving the lives of middle-income families.
 After the initial contact, prospective recruits typically are invited to an opportunity meeting, which is conducted by an RVP. The objective of an opportunity meeting is to inform prospective recruits about our mission and their opportunity to start their own businesses by becoming sales representatives. At the conclusion of each opportunity meeting, prospective recruits are asked to complete an application and pay a nominal fee to commence their pre-licensing training and licensing examination preparation programs and, depending on the state or province, to cover their licensing exam registration costs, which are provided by the Company generally at no additional charge. Recruits are not obligated to purchase any of the products we offer in order to become sales representatives, though they may elect to make such purchases. 
 Recruits may become our clients or provide us with access to their friends, family members and personal acquaintances. As a result, we continually work to improve our systematic approach to recruiting and training new sales representatives.
 Similar to other distribution systems that rely upon part-time sales representatives and typical of the life insurance industry in general, we experience wide disparities in the productivity of individual sales representatives. Many new recruits do not get licensed, often due to the time commitment required to obtain licenses and various regulatory and licensing hurdles. Many licensed sales representatives are only marginally active, as there are no minimum life insurance production requirements. As a result, we plan for this disparate level of productivity and view a continuous recruiting cycle as a key component of our distribution model. Our distribution model is designed to address the varying productivity associated with sales representatives by paying production-based compensation, emphasizing recruiting, and developing initiatives to address barriers to licensing new recruits. By providing commissions to sales

representatives on the sales generated by their sales organization, our compensation structure aligns the interests of sales representatives with our interests in recruiting new representatives and creating sustainable sales production.
 The following table provides information on new recruits and life insurance-licensed sales representatives:
  
 | Year ended December 31, | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Number of new recruits | | 290,886 | | 303,867 | | 262,732
Number of newly life insurance-licensed sales representatives | | 48,041 | | 48,535 | | 44,724 
Number of life insurance-licensed sales representatives, at period end | | 130,736 | | 126,121 | | 116,827
Average number of life insurance-licensed sales representatives during period | | 128,977 | | 121,291 | | 111,843

 We define new recruits as individuals who have submitted an independent business application to become sales representatives together with payment of the nominal fee to commence their pre-licensing training. Certain recruits may not meet the compliance standards to become a sales representative, and others elect to withdraw prior to becoming actively engaged.
 On average, it takes approximately three months for sales representatives to complete the necessary applications and pre-licensing coursework and to pass the applicable state or provincial examinations to obtain a license to sell our term life insurance products. As a result, individuals recruited to become sales representatives within a given fiscal period may not become licensed sales representatives or meet compliance standards until a subsequent period.
 Sales Force Motivation, Training, Communication and Sales Support Tools
 Motivating, training and communicating with the sales force are critical to our success and that of the sales force.
 Motivation. Through our proven system of sales force recognition events, contests and communications, we provide incentives that drive our results. Motivation is driven in part by sales representatives’ desire to achieve higher levels of financial success by building their own businesses as sales representatives. The opportunity to help underserved middle-income households address financial challenges is also a source of motivation for many sales representatives.
 We motivate sales representatives to succeed in their businesses by:
  
• | compensating sales representatives for product sales made by them and their sales organizations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | training sales representatives on financial fundamentals so they can confidently and effectively assist our clients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reducing the administrative burden on the sales force, which allows them to devote more of their time to building a sales organization and selling products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | creating a culture in which sales representatives are encouraged to achieve goals through the recognition of their sales and recruiting achievements, as well as those of their sales organizations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We conduct numerous local, regional and national meetings to help inform and motivate the sales force. In June 2019, we will be hosting our biennial international convention and associated meetings at the Georgia World Congress Center and Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. In previous years, tens of thousands of sales representatives, including new recruits, have attended our conventions and associated meetings at their own expense, which we believe further demonstrates their commitment to our organization and mission.
 Training, Communication and Sales Support Tools: Primerica Online (“POL”), delivered through a secure Intranet website and a cross-platform mobile application (“Primerica App”), is our primary tool designed to support sales representatives and assist them in building their own businesses. We provide sales representatives with communication, training, and sales support tools on POL that allow both new and experienced sales representatives to offer financial information and products to our clients. POL provides sales representatives with access to various business tracking and management tools, licensing support tools, product-specific training, and sales procedures and tools. Additionally, POL provides access to internal training programs and videos covering sales, management skills, business ownership, and compliance. We also use POL to provide real-time recognition of sales representatives’ successes and scoreboards for sales force production, contests, and incentive trips. In addition, POL is a gateway to our product providers and product support. Subscribers generally pay a small monthly fee to subscribe to POL, which helps cover the cost of developing new resources and maintaining this support system. A limited version of POL that provides access to Primerica e-mail, compliance and compensation information, newsletters and bulletins is available at no cost.
 The primary features and tools available on POL include:
  
• | Training and Licensing Tools: POL provides sales representatives with access to study tools for life insurance and securities licensing examinations such as pre-licensing study materials, on-demand videos, personalized licensing study plans, exam simulators, progress tracking, and exam and license registration. POL also provides access to obtain online certifications to sell certain other distributed products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Communication Tools: POL provides access to marketing materials for our product offerings, Company news and events, live streaming shows, on-demand videos, home office bulletins, Primerica e-mail, contact lists, and a hosted professional business

website for sales representatives. We broadcast and deliver video content on POL through our own digital video channel, PFN TV. We create original broadcasts and videos that enable senior management to provide business updates to the sales force as well as training and motivational presentations. We broadcast live programs hosted by home office management and selected RVPs that focus on new developments and provide motivational messages to the sales force. We also broadcast training-oriented programs to the sales force on a weekly basis and profile successful sales representatives, allowing these individuals to educate and train other sales representatives by sharing their methods for success.

• | Sales Support and Client Management Tools:
--+-------------------------------------------


- | Our Financial Needs Analysis: Our FNA is a proprietary, needs-based analysis tool. The FNA gives sales representatives the ability to collect and synthesize client financial data and develop a financial analysis for the client that is easily understood. The FNA helps our clients understand their financial needs in the areas of debt, financial protection, and savings as well as introduces prudent financial concepts, such as regular saving and accelerating the repayment of high cost credit card debt to help them reach their financial goals. The FNA also provides clients with a snapshot of their current financial position and identifies their life insurance, savings and debt resolution needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Our Point-of-Sale Application Tool: Our point-of-sale technology, TurboApps, is an internally developed system that streamlines the application process for our insurance and investment products. These applications populate client information from the FNA to eliminate redundant data collection and provide real-time feedback to eliminate incomplete and illegible applications. Integrated with our paperless field office management system described below and with our home office systems, TurboApps allows RVPs and us to realize the efficiencies of straight-through-processing of application data and other information collected on sales representatives’ mobile devices, which results in expedited processing of product sales. TurboApps is available on the sales representatives’ portal, POL and our mobile platform, the Primerica App.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | EZ-Key: In 2018, we launched our latest addition to our TurboApps offerings, EZ-Key. EZ-Key allows sales representatives to seamlessly move from a mobile life insurance application to a pre-filled investment and savings products application, streamlining the investment discussion. This tool helps sales representatives guide clients through the investment decision process and ultimately provides investment alternatives based on the client’s individual situation. Further, we believe the new technology creates efficiencies and drives long-term productivity as well as makes the ISP business more attractive to sales representatives who are considering obtaining a securities license.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Primerica App: The mobile Primerica App platform has experienced broad adoption and provides the sales force with access to the critical components needed to start, build and maintain their business. We continue to enhance and expand the scope and resources available in this strategic platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Virtual Base Shop: In an effort to ease the administrative burden on RVPs and simplify sales force operations, we make available to RVPs a secure Intranet-based paperless field office management system as part of the POL subscription. This virtual office is designed to automate the RVP’s administrative responsibilities and can be accessed by subscribing sales representatives in an RVP’s immediate sales organization, which we refer to as his or her base shop.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Shareholder Account Manager (“SAM”): SAM is a web-based tool that allows securities-licensed representatives to service client investments in mutual funds accessed through our transfer agent recordkeeping platform.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Client Relationship Manager (“CRM”): Our CRM tool allows sales representatives and their RVPs to organize client information, such as personal contact information, product relationships, account details, notes, appointments and follow-ups, in one place to enable fast and convenient access for managing client relationships.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, our publications department produces materials to support, motivate and inform the sales force. We sell recruiting materials, sales brochures, business cards and stationery and provide communications services that include web design, print presentations, graphic design and script writing. We also produce a weekly mailing that includes materials promoting our current incentives, as well as the latest news about our product offerings.
 Performance-Based Compensation Structure
 Our commission structure is rooted in our origin as an insurance agency. Sales representatives can receive compensation in multiple ways, including:
  
• | sales commissions and fees based on their personal sales, referrals, and client assets under management;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales commissions based on sales and referrals by sales representatives in their sales organizations and fees based on client assets under management in their sales organizations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | bonuses and other compensation, including agent equity awards, generated by their own sales performance, the aggregate sales performance of their sales organizations and other criteria.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our compensation structure pays commissions to the sales representative who sells the product and to several representatives above the selling representative within their sales organization. With respect to term life insurance sales, commissions are calculated based on the total first-year premium (excluding the policy fee) for all policies and riders. To motivate the sales force, we compensate sales representatives for term life insurance product sales as quickly as possible. We advance a majority of the insurance commission upon 
 5

the submission of a completed application and the first month’s premium payment. As the client makes his or her premium payments, the commission is earned by the sales representative and the commission advance is recovered by the Company. If premium payments are not made by the client and the policy terminates, any outstanding advance commission is charged back to the sales representative. The chargeback, which only occurs in the first year of a policy, equals that portion of the advance that was made, but not earned, by the sales representative because the client did not pay the full premium for the period of time for which the advance was made to the sales representative. Chargebacks, which occur in the normal course of business, may be recovered by reducing any cash amounts otherwise payable by the Company to the sales representative.
 Sales representatives and representatives above them in their sales organizations are contractually obligated to repay us any commission advances that are ultimately not earned due to the underlying policy lapsing prior to the full commission being earned. Additionally, we hold back a portion of the commissions earned by sales representatives as a reserve out of which we may recover chargebacks. The amounts held back are referred to as deferred compensation account commissions (“DCA commissions”). DCA commissions are available to reduce amounts owed to the Company by sales representatives and they provide a sales representative with a cushion against the chargeback obligations of representatives in their sales organization. DCA commissions, unless applied to amounts owed, are ultimately released to sales representatives.
 We pay most term life insurance commissions during the first policy year. One of our term riders provides for coverage increases after the first year. For such riders, we pay first-year and renewal commissions only for premium increases related to the increased coverage. Additionally, we pay renewal commissions on some older in-force policies. At the end of a policy’s level premium paying period, we pay commissions on policy exchanges and bonuses on some policy exchanges and continuations.
 We also pay bonuses as a percentage of premiums to RVPs with respect to sales of term life policies and riders, up to a maximum premium. Bonuses are paid to RVPs for achieving specified production levels.
 For most mutual funds (non-managed investments) and annuity products, commissions are paid both on the sale and on the value of assets under management. Commissions are calculated based on the dealer reallowance and trail compensation actually paid to us. For managed investment products, fees earned are primarily based on the assets under management and represent the fee we receive as compensation for as long as we retain the account. For our Canadian segregated fund investment products, we pay sales representatives a sales commission based on the amount invested and a monthly fee based on clients’ asset values.
 We also pay the sales force with respect to sales of prepaid legal services subscriptions and referrals for customers purchasing other distributed products. Prepaid legal services commissions paid to the sales force are earned in fixed amounts on a monthly basis as long as the prepaid legal service subscription remains active. Commissions related to other distributed products are calculated based on the type of product sold or referred.
 In addition to these methods of compensation, RVPs can earn agent equity awards every quarter based largely on sales production.  
 Sales Force Licensing and Support
 The states, provinces and territories in which sales representatives operate generally require sales representatives to obtain and maintain licenses to sell our insurance and securities products, requiring sales representatives to pass applicable examinations. Sales representatives may also be required to maintain licenses to sell certain of our other distributed products. To encourage new recruits to obtain their life insurance licenses, we either pay directly or reimburse the sales representative for certain licensing-related fees and expenses once he or she passes the applicable exam and obtains the applicable life insurance license.
 To sell insurance products, sales representatives must be licensed by their resident state, province or territory and by any other state, province or territory in which they do business. In most states, sales representatives must be appointed by our applicable insurance subsidiary. Our in-house life insurance licensing program offers new recruits a significant number of classroom life insurance pre-licensing courses to meet applicable state and provincial licensing requirements and prepares recruits to pass applicable licensing exams.
 To sell mutual funds and variable annuity products, U.S. sales representatives must be registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and hold the appropriate license(s) designated by each state in which they sell securities products, as well as be appointed by the annuity underwriter in the states in which they market annuity products. Sales representatives must meet all state and federal regulatory requirements and be designated as an investment advisor representative in order to sell our managed investment products. We contract with third-party training firms to conduct securities license exam preparation for sales representatives, and we also offer supplemental training tools.
 Canadian sales representatives selling mutual fund products are required to be licensed by the securities regulators in the provinces and territories in which they sell mutual fund products. Canadian sales representatives who are licensed to sell our insurance products do not need any further licensing to sell our segregated funds products. 
 For sales of our other distributed products, appropriate state, provincial and territorial licensing may be required.

Supervision and Compliance
 To ensure compliance with various federal, state, provincial and territorial legal requirements, we along with the RVPs share responsibility for maintaining an overall compliance program that involves compliance training and supporting as well as monitoring the activities of sales representatives. We work with the RVPs to develop and maintain appropriate compliance procedures and systems.
 Generally, all RVPs must obtain a principal license (FINRA Series 26 in the United States and Branch Manager license in Canada), and, as a result, they assume responsibility over the activities of their sales organizations. Additional supervision is provided by designated Offices of Supervisory Jurisdiction (“OSJs”), which are currently run by select RVPs who receive additional compensation for assuming responsibility for certain supervision and monitoring across all product lines. OSJs are required to periodically inspect sales force field offices and report to us any compliance issues they observe. In 2019, some responsibilities of the OSJs will transition to our Compliance Department, which will take on an expanded role in the supervision and monitoring of RVPs. As part of the transition, the select RVPs that were designated as OSJ will no longer maintain the regulatory OSJ designation, which will afford them more time to focus on growing their businesses. In addition, our Compliance Department regularly runs surveillance reports designed to monitor the activity of the sales force and investigates any unusual or suspicious activity identified during these reviews or during periodic inspections of RVP offices.
 All sales representatives are required to participate in our annual regulatory-required compliance meeting, a program administered by our senior management and our legal and compliance staff. We provide a compliance training overview across all product lines and require the completion of compliance checklists by each licensed sales representative for each product he or she offers. Additionally, sales representatives receive periodic compliance communications regarding new compliance developments and issues of special significance. Furthermore, OSJs are required to complete an annual training program that focuses on regulatory compliance requirements.
 Our Field Audit Department regularly conducts audits of all sales representative offices, including scheduled and no-notice audits. The Field Audit Department reviews all regulatory-required records that are not maintained at our home office. Any compliance deficiencies noted in the audit must be corrected, and we carefully monitor all corrective action. Audit deficiencies are addressed through reprimands, probations and contract terminations.
 Our Product Offerings
 Reflecting our philosophy of helping middle-income clients with their financial product needs and ensuring compatibility with our distribution model, our product offerings generally meet the following criteria:

• | Consistent with sound individual finance principles: Products must be consistent with good personal finance principles for middle-income consumers, such as financial protection, encouraging long-term savings and reducing debt.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Designed to support multiple client goals: Products are designed to address and support a broad range of financial goals rather than compete with or cannibalize each other. For example, term life insurance does not compete with mutual funds because term life insurance has no cash value or investment element.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ongoing needs based: Products are generally designed to meet the ongoing financial needs of many middle-income consumers. This long-term approach bolsters our relationship with our clients by allowing us to continue to serve them as their financial needs evolve.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We use three operating segments to organize, evaluate and manage our business: Term Life Insurance; Investment and Savings Products; and Corporate and Other Distributed Products.

Term Life Insurance 
 Through our three life insurance subsidiaries – Primerica Life, NBLIC and Primerica Life Canada – we offer term life insurance to clients in the United States, its territories, the District of Columbia and Canada. In 2017, the latest period for which data is available from LIMRA, we ranked as a leading provider of individual term life insurance in the United States.
 We believe that term life insurance is generally a better alternative for middle-income clients than cash value life insurance. Term life insurance provides a guaranteed death benefit if the insured dies during the fixed coverage period of an in-force policy, thereby providing financial protection for his or her named beneficiaries in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Term insurance products, which are sometimes referred to as pure protection products, have no savings or investment features. By buying term life insurance rather than cash value life insurance, a policyholder initially pays a lower premium and, as a result, may have funds available to invest for retirement and other needs. We also believe that a person’s need for life insurance is inversely proportional to that person’s need for retirement savings, a concept we refer to as the theory of decreasing responsibility. Young adults with children, new mortgages and other obligations need to buy higher amounts of insurance to protect their family from the loss of future income resulting from the death of a primary bread winner. With its lower initial premium, term life insurance lets young families buy more coverage for their premium dollar when their needs are greatest and still have the ability to have funds for their retirement and other savings goals.

We design our term life insurance products to be easily understood by, and meet the needs of, our clients. Clients purchasing our term life insurance products generally seek stable, longer-term income protection products for themselves and their families. In response to this demand, we offer term life insurance products with level-premium coverage periods that range from 10 to 35 years and a wide range of coverage face amounts. Additionally, certain term life insurance policies may be customized through the addition of riders to provide coverage for specific protection needs, such as mortgage and college expense protection. Policies remain in force until the expiration of the coverage period or until the policyholder ceases to make premium payments and terminates the policy. Our in-force term life insurance policies have level premiums for the stated term period. As such, the policyholder pays the same amount each year. Initial policy term periods are between 10 and 35 years. 
 One of the innovative term life insurance products that we offer is TermNow, our rapid issue term life product that provides for face amounts of up to $300,000 (local currency). TermNow allows a sales representative to submit an application via TurboApps and, with the client’s permission, allows the Company to access databases, including Medical Information Bureau (“MIB”) data in the United States and Canada and prescription drug and motor vehicle records in the United States, as part of the underwriting process. The Company uses this data and the client’s responses to application questions to determine any additional underwriting requirements. Results of these processes are reported in real time to our underwriting system, which then determines whether or not we can rapidly issue a policy. 
 The average face amount of our in-force policies issued in 2018 was approximately $246,200. The following table sets forth selected information regarding our term life insurance product portfolio:
  
 | Year ended December 31, |

Face amount in force (in millions) | $ | 781,041 | | $ | 763,831 | | $ | 728,385 

 Pricing and Underwriting. We believe that effective pricing and underwriting are significant drivers of the profitability of our life insurance business and we have established our pricing assumptions to be consistent with our underwriting practices. We set pricing assumptions for expected claims, lapses and expenses based on our experience and other factors while also considering the competitive environment. These other factors include:

• | expected changes from relevant experience due to changes in circumstances, such as (i) revised underwriting procedures affecting future mortality and reinsurance rates, (ii) new product features, and (iii) revised administrative programs affecting sales levels, expenses, and client continuation or termination of policies; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | observed trends in experience that we expect to continue, such as general mortality changes in the general population and better or worse policy persistency (the period over which a policy remains in force) due to changing economic conditions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under our current underwriting guidelines, we individually assess each insurable adult applicant and place each applicant into a risk classification based on current health, medical history and other factors. Each classification (generally preferred plus, preferred, non-tobacco and tobacco) has specific health criteria. We may decline an applicant’s request for coverage if his or her health or activities create unacceptable risks for us.
 Sales representatives ask applicants a series of “yes” or “no” questions regarding the applicant’s medical history. We may also consider information about the applicant from third-party sources, such as the MIB, prescription drug databases, motor vehicle records and physician statements. If we believe that further information regarding an applicant’s medical history is necessary, we use a third-party provider and its trained personnel to contact the applicant by telephone to obtain a more detailed medical history. Additionally, we may require copies of applicants’ medical information from their attending physicians. The report resulting from this process is electronically transmitted to us and is evaluated in our underwriting process. Paramedical requirements are also needed on applicants applying for the Custom Advantage product. 
 To accommodate the significant volume of insurance business that we process, we and the sales force use specialized technology. We offer sales representatives an electronic life insurance application that supports TermNow and other term life insurance products. Approximately 95% of the life insurance applications we received in 2018 were submitted electronically via TurboApps. Our electronic life insurance application reduces errors in submitted applications, collects the applicant’s electronic signatures and populates the RVP’s sales log. Once an application is complete, the pertinent application data is uploaded to our life insurance administrative systems, which manage the underwriting process by electronically analyzing data, recommending underwriting decisions, identifying requirements for higher face amounts or older ages and communicating with the sales representative and third-party service providers.

Claims Management. Our insurance subsidiaries processed over 15,400 life insurance benefit claims in 2018 on policies underwritten by us and sold by sales representatives. These claims fall into three categories: death, waiver of premium (applicable to disabled policyholders who purchased a rider pursuant to which we agree to waive remaining life insurance premiums during a qualifying disability), or terminal illness. The claim may be reported by a sales representative, a beneficiary or, in the case of qualifying disability or terminal illness, the policyholder. Following are the benefits paid by us for each category of claim:
  
 | Year ended December 31, | 
---------------------+-------------------------+----------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
 | (In thousands) | 
Death | $ | 1,391,755 | | $ | 1,388,027 | | $ | 1,238,393
Waiver of premium | | 46,690 | | | 45,146 | | | 43,168 
Terminal illness (1) | | 16,474 | | | 16,389 | | | 14,232 


(1) | We consider claims paid for terminal illness to be loans made to the beneficiary that are repaid to us upon death of the beneficiary from the death benefit.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the United States, after coverage has been in force for two years, we may not contest the policy for misrepresentations in the application or the suicide of the insured. In Canada, we have a similar two-year contestability period, but we are permitted to contest insurance fraud at any time. As a matter of policy, we do not contest any coverage issued by us to replace the face amount of another insurance company’s individual coverage to the extent the replaced coverage would not be contestable by the replaced company. We believe this approach helps sales representatives sell replacement policies, as it reassures clients that claims made under their replacement policies are not more likely to be contested as to the face amount replaced. Through our claims administration system, we record, process and pay the appropriate benefit for any reported claim. Our claims system is used by our home office investigators to order medical and investigative reports from third-party providers, calculate amounts due to the beneficiary (including interest), and report payments to the appropriate reinsurance providers.
 Primerica Life and NBLIC regularly consult the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File in accordance with applicable state requirements. These processes help identify potential deceased policyholders for whom claims have not been presented in the normal course of business. If unreported deaths are identified, Primerica Life and NBLIC attempt to determine if a valid claim exists, to locate beneficiaries, and to pay benefits accordingly.  
 Reinsurance. We use reinsurance primarily to reduce the volatility risk with respect to mortality. Since 1994, we have reinsured death benefits in the United States on a first dollar quota share yearly renewable term basis. We pay premiums to each reinsurer based on rates in the applicable agreement.
 We generally reinsure between 80% and 90% of the mortality risk for all term life insurance policies, excluding coverage under certain riders. We also reinsure substandard cases on a facultative basis to capitalize on the extensive experience some of our reinsurers have with substandard cases. A substandard case has a level of risk that is acceptable to us, but at higher premium rates than a standard case because of the health, habits or occupation of the applicant.
 While our reinsurance agreements have indefinite terms, both we and our reinsurers are entitled to discontinue any reinsurance agreement as to future policies by giving advance notice of 90 days to the other. Each reinsurer’s ability to terminate coverage for existing policies is limited to circumstances such as a material breach of contract or nonpayment of premiums by us. Each reinsurer has the right to increase rates with certain restrictions. If a reinsurer increases rates, we have the right to immediately recapture the business. Either party may offset any balance due from the other party. For additional information on our reinsurance, see Note 1 (Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 6 (Reinsurance) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 Financial Strength Ratings. Ratings with respect to financial strength are an important factor in establishing our competitive position and maintaining public confidence in us and our ability to market products. Ratings organizations review the financial performance and condition of most insurers and provide opinions regarding financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financial Ratings.”
Investment and Savings Products
 We believe that many middle-income families have significant unmet retirement and savings needs. Using our FNA tool, sales representatives help our clients understand their current financial situations and how they can use time-tested financial principles, such as prioritizing personal savings, to reach their savings goals. Our product offerings comprise saving and investment vehicles that seek to meet the needs of clients in all stages of life.
 Through PFS, PFS Investments, Primerica Life Canada, PFSL Investments Canada, and licensed sales representatives, we distribute and sell to our clients a variety of mutual funds, managed investments, variable and fixed annuities, fixed indexed annuities and segregated funds. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 25,370 sales representatives were licensed to distribute mutual funds in the United States (including Puerto Rico) and Canada. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 13,820 sales representatives were licensed and appointed to distribute annuities in the United States and approximately 12,470 sales representatives were licensed to sell segregated funds in Canada.

In the United States, clients acquire securities products from PFS Investments in either a brokerage or advisory relationship.  In a brokerage relationship, a PFS Investments registered representative is required pursuant to FINRA rules to make a suitable recommendation for the client, but provides no ongoing monitoring of the client’s investments. PFS Investments markets mutual funds and variable annuities on a brokerage basis.  In an advisory relationship, namely our managed investment offerings, PFS Investments and its investment advisory representative have a fiduciary obligation to provide suitable initial recommendations to the client and ongoing monitoring of the client’s investments.  
 Mutual Funds. In the United States, licensed sales representatives primarily distribute mutual funds from the following select asset management firms: American Century Investments, American Funds, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, Legg Mason and Amundi Pioneer. These firms have diversified product offerings, including domestic and international equity, fixed-income and money market funds. Each firm continually evaluates its fund offerings and adds new funds on a regular basis. Additionally, their product offerings reflect diversified asset classes and varied investment styles. We have selling agreements with a number of other fund companies and we believe that, collectively, these asset management firms provide funds that meet the investment needs of our clients.
 During 2018, four of these fund families (Legg Mason, Invesco, American Funds, and Franklin Templeton) accounted for approximately 94% of our mutual fund sales in the United States. Legg Mason and Invesco each have large wholesaling teams that support the sales force in distributing their mutual fund products. Our selling agreements with these firms all have indefinite terms and provide for termination at will.  
 A wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Parent Company and affiliate of PFS Investments, Primerica Shareholder Services, Inc. (“PSS”), provides transfer agent recordkeeping services to investors who purchase shares of mutual funds offered by American Century Investments, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, Legg Mason or Amundi Pioneer through PFS Investments. In exchange for these services, PSS receives recordkeeping and account maintenance fees from the applicable fund company.  PSS has retained BNY Mellon Asset Servicing to perform the necessary transfer agent recordkeeping services for these accounts on its proprietary SuRPASS system.  PFS Investments serves as the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) approved non-bank custodian for customers that open individual retirement accounts (“IRA”) (or certain other retirement accounts) with PFS Investments and invest in shares of mutual funds offered by American Century Investments, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, Legg Mason or Amundi Pioneer. For these services, PFS Investments receives an annual custodian fee.
 In Canada, sales representatives offer Primerica-branded Concert™ Series funds, which accounted for approximately 40% of our Canadian mutual fund product sales in 2018. Our Concert™ Series funds consist of six different asset allocation funds with varying investment objectives ranging from fixed income to aggressive growth. Each Concert™ Series fund is a fund of funds that allocates fund assets among equity and income mutual funds of AGF Investments, a leading asset management firm in Canada. The asset allocation within each Concert™ Series fund is determined on an advisory contract basis by Morneau Shepell Asset and Risk Management Ltd. The principal non-proprietary funds that we offer our clients in Canada are funds of AGF Investments, Mackenzie Investments, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco. Sales of these non-proprietary funds accounted for approximately 52% of mutual fund product sales in Canada in 2018. Like our U.S. fund family list, the asset management partners we have chosen in Canada have a diversified offering of equity, fixed-income and money market funds, including domestic and international funds with a variety of investment styles.
 A key part of our investment philosophy for our clients is the long-term benefits of dollar cost averaging through systematic investing. To accomplish this, we assist our clients by facilitating monthly contributions to their investment account by bank draft against their checking accounts. During the year ended December 31, 2018, average client assets held in individual retirement accounts in the United States and Canada accounted for an estimated 74% and 71% of total average client account assets, respectively. Our individual retirement accounts in Canada are considered registered retirement savings plans (“RRSP”). An RRSP is similar to a traditional IRA, in the United States in that contributions are made to the RRSP on a pre-tax basis and income is earned on a tax-deferred basis. Our high concentration of retirement plan accounts and our systematic savings philosophy are beneficial to us as these accounts tend to have lower redemption rates than the industry and, therefore, generate more recurring asset-based revenues.
 Managed Investments. PFS Investments (dba PFS Advisors) is a registered investment advisor in the United States, and it offers a managed investments program, Primerica Advisors Lifetime Investment Platform (the “Lifetime Investment Platform”), which we launched in 2017. The Lifetime Investment Platform, which replaced our previous Freedom Portfolios managed investments platform, is a robust advisory offering designed for clients who have at least $25,000 of investable assets. It provides our customers access to mutual fund and exchange-traded fund investment models designed and managed by several unaffiliated investment advisers. PFS Investments, as sponsor and portfolio manager of the program, evaluates models for inclusion in the program and conducts ongoing due diligence of the models and unaffiliated investment advisers made available through the program. TD Ameritrade Institutional, an unaffiliated broker-dealer, provides custody, trade execution, clearing, settlement and other services for customer assets invested through the Lifetime Investment Platform.      
 Variable Annuities. U.S. securities licensed sales representatives also distribute variable annuities issued by American General Life Insurance Company and its affiliates (“AIG”), AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company (“AXA Life”), Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and its affiliates (“Lincoln National”), and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (“Brighthouse Life”). Variable annuities are insurance products that enable our clients to invest in accounts with attributes similar to mutual funds, but also have benefits not found in mutual funds, including death benefits that protect beneficiaries from losses due to a market downturn and income benefits that guarantee future income payments for the life of the policyholder(s). We also offer structured variable annuities 
 11

issued by AXA Life and Brighthouse Life. Structured variable annuities are insurance contracts that provide investors with potential growth, subject to a cap, and partial downside protection against losses. Gains and losses are measured over a fixed period, typically three to six years, based on the performance of a securities index. Although linked to an index, an investment in these contracts does not involve ownership of any underlying portfolio securities by the client.  Each of these companies bears the insurance risk on its variable annuities and structured variable annuities that we distribute.
 Fixed Indexed Annuities. We offer fixed indexed annuity products in the U.S. through Lincoln National, AIG, and Universal Life Insurance Company (“Universal Life”) (Puerto Rico). These products combine safety of principal and guaranteed rates of return with additional investment options tied to equity market indices that allow for returns that move based on the performance of an index. We believe these and other fixed annuity products give both life and securities representatives more ways to assist our clients with their retirement planning needs.
 Fixed Annuities. We sell fixed annuities underwritten by Brighthouse in the U.S. Our current offering includes a fixed premium deferred annuity and a single premium immediate annuity. The fixed premium deferred annuity allows our clients to accumulate savings on a tax deferred basis with safety of principal and a guaranteed rate of return. The single premium immediate annuity provides clients with an immediate income alternative. In Puerto Rico, we currently offer two annuity products: a fixed annuity and a fixed bonus annuity underwritten by Universal Life. These products provide guarantees against loss with several income options.
 Segregated Funds. In Canada, we offer segregated fund products, branded as our Common Sense FundsTM, that have some of the characteristics of our variable annuity products distributed in the United States. Our Common Sense FundsTM are underwritten by Primerica Life Canada and offer our clients the ability to participate in a diversified managed investments program that can be opened for as little as $25. While the assets and corresponding liability (reserves) are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, the assets are held in trust for the benefit of the segregated fund contract owners and are not commingled with the general assets of the Company.
 There are three fund products within our segregated funds offerings: the Asset Builder Funds, the Strategic Retirement Income Funds (“SRIF”), and a money market fund known as the Cash Management Fund. The investment objective of Asset Builder Funds is long-term capital appreciation combined with some guarantee of principal. Unlike mutual funds, our Asset Builder Funds product guarantees clients at least 75% of their net contributions (net of withdrawals) at the earlier of the date of their death or at the Asset Builder Funds’ maturity date, which is selected by the client. The portfolio consists of both equities and fixed-income securities with the equity component consisting of a pool of primarily large cap Canadian and U.S. equities and the fixed-income component consisting of Canadian federal government zero coupon treasuries and government-backed floating rate notes. The portion of the Asset Builder Funds’ portfolio allocated to zero coupon treasuries are held in sufficient quantity to satisfy the guarantees payable at the maturity date of each Asset Builder Fund. As a result, our potential loss exposure is very low as it comes from the guarantees payable upon the death of the client prior to the maturity date. 
 The investment objective of the SRIF is to provide income during retirement plus the opportunity for modest capital appreciation. The SRIF product guarantees clients 75% of their net contributions (net of withdrawals) at the earlier of the date of their death or age 100. The portfolio consists of both equities and fixed-income securities, with the equities consisting of a pool of primarily large cap Canadian and U.S. equites that are capped at 25% of the portfolio. The balance is a fixed-income portfolio consisting of investment-grade government and corporate bonds. The high quality of the investments and the percentage cap on equities results in a relatively low potential loss exposure. All accounts in the SRIF are held as Registered Retirement Income Funds which carry government-mandated minimum annual withdrawals. Similar to the Asset Builder Funds, our potential exposure for loss associated with the SRIF is very low as its investment allocations are conservatively aligned with the risks of the client contracts. 
 The Cash Management Fund invests in government guaranteed short-term bonds and short-term commercial and bank papers, with the principal investment objective being the provision of interest income while maintaining liquidity and preserving capital.
 With the guarantee level at 75% and in light of the time until the scheduled maturity of our segregated funds contracts, we currently do not believe it is necessary to allocate any corporate capital as reserves for segregated fund contract benefits.
 Investment and Savings Products Revenue. In the United States, we earn revenue from our ISP business in three ways: commissions and payments earned on the sale of such products; fees and payments earned based upon client asset values; and account-based revenue. On the sale of mutual funds (not including managed investments) and annuities, we earn a dealer re-allowance or commission on new purchases as well as trail commissions on the assets held in our clients’ accounts. We also receive marketing and distribution fees from most of our mutual fund and annuity providers. These payments are typically a percentage of sales or a percentage of the clients’ total asset values, or a combination of both. For investments into the Lifetime Investment Platform, we receive an asset-based fee as compensation for the investment advisory and other administrative services we provide.
 As the IRS approved non-bank custodian for certain funds noted above, PFS Investments receives annual fees on a per-account basis for as long as it services the account.  As explained above, PSS receives transfer agent recordkeeping fees for the services it provides to the five fund families noted above in “Mutual Funds” section. An individual client account may include multiple fund positions for which we earn recordkeeping fees.
 12

Because the total amount of these fees fluctuates with the number of such accounts and positions within those accounts, the opening or closing of accounts has a direct impact on our revenues. From time to time, the fund companies for whom we provide these services request that accounts or positions with small balances be closed.
 In Canada, we earn revenue from the sales of our investment and savings products in two ways: commissions (or dealer reallowance) on mutual fund sales and fees paid based upon clients’ asset values (mutual fund trail commissions and investment advisory fees from segregated funds and Concert™ Series funds). On segregated funds, we also earn deferred sales charges for early withdrawals at an annual declining rate within seven years of an investor’s original contribution. 
 Other Distributed Products
 We distribute other products, including prepaid legal services, auto and homeowners’ insurance referrals, and home automation solutions. In Canada, we also offer mortgage loan referrals and insurance offerings for small businesses. While some of these products are Primerica-branded, all of them are underwritten or otherwise provided by a third party.
 We offer our U.S. and Canadian clients a Primerica-branded prepaid legal services program on a subscription basis that is underwritten and provided by LegalShield. The prepaid legal services program offers a network of attorneys in each state, province or territory to assist subscribers with legal matters such as drafting wills, living wills and powers of attorney, trial defense and motor vehicle-related matters. We receive a commission based on sales and renewals of these subscriptions.
 We have an arrangement with Answer Financial, Inc. (“Answer Financial”), an independent insurance agency, whereby U.S. sales representatives refer clients to Answer Financial to receive multiple, competitive auto and homeowners’ insurance quotes. Answer Financial’s comparative quote process allows clients to easily identify the underwriter that is most competitively priced for their type of risk. We receive commissions based on completed auto and homeowners’ placement of insurance and policy renewals and pay sales representatives a flat referral fee for each completed application and policy renewal.
 We have an arrangement with Vivint, Inc. (“Vivint”), a company that offers homeowners in the U.S. and many provinces in Canada a comprehensive suite of products and services to protect and remotely control, monitor and manage their homes using any Internet-connected smart device. We receive commissions based on referrals that result in a subscription to Vivint’s home services and pay sales representatives a referral fee for each such subscription. 
 In Canada, we have a referral program for mortgage loan products offered by a third-party lender, B2B Bank. Due to regulatory requirements, sales representatives in Canada only refer clients to the lender and are not involved in the loan application and closing process. We receive referral fees based on the funded loan amount and, in turn, pay a commission to sales representatives. 
 In Canada, we offer insurance products, including supplemental medical and dental, accidental death, and disability, to small businesses. These insurance products are underwritten and provided by The Edge Benefits Inc. and its affiliates. We receive a commission based on sales and renewals of these policies.
 Regulation
 Our business is subject to extensive laws and governmental regulations, including administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. The purpose of the laws and regulations affecting our business is primarily to protect our clients and other consumers. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
 Regulatory authorities periodically make inquiries regarding compliance by us and our subsidiaries with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities businesses. At any given time, a number of financial or market conduct examinations of our subsidiaries may be ongoing. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. 
 Regulation of Our Insurance Business. Primerica Life, as a Tennessee-domiciled insurer, is regulated by the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance and is licensed to transact business in the United States (except New York), the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories. NBLIC, as a New York-domiciled life insurance underwriting company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Primerica Life, is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) and is licensed to transact business in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
 State insurance laws and regulations regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance business. Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and, in some instances, discretionary power dealing with many aspects of our business, which may include, among other things, premium rates and increases thereto, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, acquisitions, mergers, and capital adequacy.
 Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file certain annual, quarterly and periodic reports with the supervisory agencies in the jurisdictions in which they do business, and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time. These examinations generally are conducted under National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) guidelines. Under the rules of these jurisdictions, insurance companies are examined periodically (generally every three to five years) by one or more of the 
 13

supervisory agencies on behalf of the states in which they do business. Our most recent examinations of the financial condition and affairs of Primerica Life and NBLIC, as well as Peach Re, Inc. (“Peach Re”) and Vidalia Re, Inc. (“Vidalia Re”), special purpose financial captive insurance companies and wholly owned subsidiaries of Primerica Life, performed by the respective domiciliary state insurance department at the time of the exams, were completed during 2016 with no material findings or recommendations noted.  
 Primerica Life Canada is federally incorporated and provincially licensed and is required to file periodic reports with Canadian regulatory agencies. It transacts business in all Canadian provinces and territories. Primerica Life Canada is regulated federally by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (“OSFI”) and provincially by the Superintendents of Insurance for each province and territory. Canadian federal and provincial insurance laws regulate all aspects of our Canadian insurance business. OSFI regulates insurers’ corporate governance, financial and prudential oversight, and regulatory compliance, while provincial and territorial regulators oversee insurers’ market conduct practices and related compliance.
 Our Canadian insurance subsidiary files quarterly and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and other locally accepted standards with OSFI in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. OSFI conducts periodic detailed examinations of insurers’ business and financial practices, including the control environment, internal and external auditing and minimum capital adequacy, surpluses and related testing, legislative compliance and appointed actuary requirements. These examinations also address regulatory compliance with anti-money laundering practices, outsourcing, related-party transactions, privacy and corporate governance. Provincial regulators conduct periodic market conduct examinations of insurers doing business in their jurisdiction.
 In addition to federal and provincial oversight, Primerica Life Canada is also subject to the guidelines set out by the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (“CLHIA”). CLHIA is an industry association that works closely with federal and provincial regulators to establish market conduct guidelines and sound business and financial practices addressing matters such as sales representative suitability and screening, insurance illustrations and partially guaranteed savings products.
 The laws and regulations governing our U.S. and Canadian insurance businesses include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including policy filings, payment of insurance commissions, disclosures, advertising, product replacement, sales and underwriting practices and complaints and claims handling. The state insurance regulatory authorities in the United States and the federal and provincial regulators in Canada generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.
 In addition, most U.S. states and Canadian provinces and territories, as well as the Canadian federal government, have laws and regulations governing the financial condition of insurers, including standards of solvency, types and concentration of investments, establishment and maintenance of reserves, reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy.  As discussed previously, U.S. state insurance law and Canadian provincial insurance law also require certain licensing of insurers and their agents.
 Insurance Holding Company Regulation; Limitations on Dividends. The states in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled have enacted legislation and adopted regulations regarding insurance holding company systems. These laws require registration of, and periodic reporting by, insurance companies domiciled within the jurisdiction that control, or are controlled by, other corporations or persons so as to constitute an insurance holding company system. These laws also affect the acquisition of control of insurance companies as well as transactions between insurance companies and companies controlling them.
 The Parent Company is a holding company that has no significant operations. Our primary asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries, and our primary liability is $375.0 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the “Senior Notes”). As a result, we depend on dividends or other distributions from our insurance and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet our obligations, including the payment of interest on, and repayment of, principal of any debt obligations.
 The states in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain restrictions on our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends to us. In Canada, dividends can be paid subject to the paying insurance company’s continuing compliance with regulatory requirements and upon notice to OSFI. We determine the dividend capacity of our insurance subsidiaries using statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) promulgated by the NAIC and each subsidiaries domiciliary state in the United States and using IFRS in Canada.
 The following table sets forth the amount of cash and distributions paid or payable by our insurance subsidiaries:
  
 | Year ended December 31, | 
----------------------+-------------------------+--------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
 | (In thousands) | 
Primerica Life | $ | 200,000 | | $ | 138,000 | | $ | 94,700
Primerica Life Canada | | 22,755 | | | 22,924 | | | 22,342

 For additional information on dividend capacity and restrictions, see Note 15 (Statutory Accounting and Dividend Restrictions) to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
 Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency Analysis. Under the laws and regulations of their jurisdictions of domicile, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their life insurance statutory reserves. In addition, other U.S. jurisdictions in which our U.S. subsidiaries are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their 
 14

domiciliary jurisdictions. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the aggregate statutory reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be provided, then the affected insurer must set up additional reserves by moving funds from surplus. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries most recently submitted these opinions without qualification to applicable insurance regulatory authorities.
 Primerica Life Canada is also required to conduct regular analyses of the sufficiency of its life insurance statutory reserves. Life insurance reserving and reporting requirements are completed by Primerica Life Canada’s appointed actuary. Materials provided by the appointed actuary are filed with OSFI as part of our annual filing and are subject to OSFI’s review. Based upon this review, OSFI may institute remedial action against Primerica Life Canada as OSFI deems necessary. Primerica Life Canada has not been subject to any such remediation or enforcement by OSFI.
 Surplus and Capital Requirements. U.S. insurance regulators have the discretionary authority, in connection with the ongoing licensing of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit the ability of an insurer to issue new policies if, in the regulators’ judgment, the insurer is not maintaining a minimum amount of surplus or is in hazardous financial condition. Insurance regulators may also limit the ability of an insurer to issue new life insurance policies and annuity contracts above an amount based upon the face amount and premiums of policies of a similar type issued in the prior year. We do not believe that the current or anticipated levels of statutory surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries present a material risk that any such regulator would limit the amount of new policies that our U.S. insurance subsidiaries may issue.
 The NAIC has established risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards for U.S. life insurance companies, as well as a risk-based capital model act (the “RBC Model Act”) that has been adopted by the state insurance regulatory authorities. The RBC Model Act provides that life insurance companies must submit an annual RBC report to state regulators regarding their RBC based upon four categories of risk: asset risk; insurance risk; interest rate risk; and business risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors that vary based upon the degree of risk to various asset, premium and policy benefit reserve items. The formula is intended to be used by insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action. If an insurer’s RBC falls below specified levels, then the insurer would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level. These actions range from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control. 
 In Canada, OSFI has authority to request an insurer to enter into a prudential agreement implementing measures to maintain or improve the insurer’s safety and soundness. OSFI also may issue orders to an insurer directing it to refrain from unsafe or unsound practices or to take action to remedy financial concerns. OSFI has neither requested that Primerica Life Canada enter into any prudential agreement nor has OSFI issued any order against Primerica Life Canada.
 In Canada, OSFI oversees an insurer’s minimum capital requirement and determines the sum of capital requirements for five categories of risk: asset default risk; mortality/morbidity/lapse risks; changes in interest rate environment risk; segregated funds risk and foreign exchange risk.  
 NAIC Pronouncements and Reviews. The NAIC promulgates model insurance laws and regulations for adoption by the states in order to standardize insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance. Although many state regulations emanate from NAIC model statutes and pronouncements, SAPs continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices. Certain changes to NAIC model statutes and pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, may take effect automatically without affirmative action by a given state. With respect to some financial regulations and guidelines, non-domiciliary states sometimes defer to the interpretation of the insurance department of the state of domicile. However, neither the action of the domiciliary state nor the action of the NAIC is binding on a non-domiciliary state. Accordingly, a non-domiciliary state could choose to follow a different interpretation.
 The NAIC has established guidelines to assess the financial strength of insurance companies for U.S. state regulatory purposes. The NAIC conducts annual reviews of the financial data of insurance companies primarily through the application of 12 financial ratios prepared on a statutory basis. The annual statements are submitted to state insurance departments to assist them in monitoring insurance companies in their state.
 Statutory Accounting Principles. SAP is a basis of accounting developed by U.S. insurance regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies. In developing SAP, insurance regulators were primarily concerned with evaluating an insurer’s ability to pay all of its current and future obligations to policyholders. As a result, statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers, generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer’s domiciliary jurisdiction. Uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the NAIC and generally adopted by regulators in the various U.S. jurisdictions. These accounting principles and related regulations determine, among other things, the amounts our insurance subsidiaries may ultimately pay to us as dividends, and they differ in many instances from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), which are designed to measure a business on a going-concern basis. Under U.S. GAAP, incremental direct costs of successful policy acquisitions are capitalized when incurred and then amortized over the life of the associated policies. The valuation of assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP is based in part upon best estimate assumptions made by the insurer. U.S. GAAP-basis stockholders’ equity represents the ownership interest in the U.S. GAAP-measured net assets held by stockholders. As a result, 
 15

the values for assets, liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP will be different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under SAP.
 State Insurance Guaranty Funds Laws. Under most state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. Most insurance guaranty fund laws currently provide that an assessment may be excused or deferred if it would threaten an insurer’s own financial strength. In addition, assessments may be partially offset by credits against future state premium taxes.
 Other Regulatory Changes. From time to time, various jurisdictions make changes to the state or provincial licensing examination process that may make it more difficult for sales representatives to obtain their life insurance licenses. In addition, certain jurisdictions have passed laws or proposed regulations that require insurers and insurance agents in the sale of life insurance, including term life insurance and annuities, to disclose conflicts of interest to consumers or meet standards of care requiring that their advice be in the customer’s best interest. The impact on our business and the level of resources necessary to conform to such new regulations will vary depending on the extent of changes required and the jurisdictions that adopt such regulations. 
 Regulation of Our Investment and Savings Products Business. PFS Investments is registered with, and regulated by, FINRA and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). It is subject to regulation by the Department of Labor (“DOL”) and by the federal and other state agencies with respect to certain retirement plans, and by state agencies. PFS Investments operates as an introducing broker-dealer, which does not hold client accounts, and is registered in all 50 U.S. states and certain territories and with the SEC. All aspects of PFS Investments’ business are regulated, including sales methods and charges, trade practices, the use and safeguarding of customer securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, conduct and supervision of its independent salespeople. 
 PFS Investments is required to file monthly reports as well as annual audited financial statements with the SEC pursuant to Section 17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and Rule 17a-5 thereunder. As part of filing these reports, PFS Investments is subject to minimum net capital requirements, as mandated by Rule 15c3‑1 of the Exchange Act. 
 The SEC rules and regulations that currently apply to PFS Investments and registered representatives generally require that we make suitable investment recommendations to our customers and disclose conflicts of interest that might affect the recommendations or advice we provide. The SEC proposed new regulations that include: (i) a new rule to establish a “best interest” standard of conduct for broker-dealers and their associated persons when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to a retail customer; (ii) new and amended rules and forms to require registered broker-dealers, investment advisers and their investment professionals to provide a relationship summary to retail investors; (iii) required disclosures in retail communications; and (iv) an SEC interpretation of the fiduciary standard of conduct for investment advisers (together, the “SEC Best Interest Proposal”). The SEC Regulatory Flexibility Agenda, released in December 2018, indicates that final action on the SEC Best Interest Proposal is expected to be taken in September 2019. 
 PFS Investments is also approved as a non-bank custodian under IRS regulations and, in that capacity, may act as a custodian or trustee for certain retirement accounts. In addition, PFS Investments is an SEC-registered investment advisor and, under the name Primerica Advisors, offers managed investment programs. In most states, sales representatives are required to obtain an additional license to offer these programs.
 PSS is registered with the SEC as a transfer agent and, accordingly, is subject to SEC rules and examinations. Acting in this capacity, PSS and third-party vendors employed by PSS are responsible for certain client investment account shareholder services.
 PFSL Investments Canada is a mutual fund dealer registered with and regulated by the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (the “MFDA”), the national self-regulatory organization for the distribution side of the Canadian mutual fund industry. It is also registered with provincial and territorial securities commissions throughout Canada (“Canadian Securities Administrators” or “CSA”). As a registered mutual fund dealer, PFSL Investments Canada performs the suitability review of mutual fund investment recommendations, and like our U.S. broker-dealer, it does not hold client accounts. PFSL Investments Canada is subject to the rules and regulations established by the Canadian Securities Administrators for the sale of securities, which include standards of conduct for the firm and its sales representatives. 
 PFSL Investments Canada is required to file monthly and annual financial statements and reports with the MFDA that are prepared to comply with the prescribed MFDA reporting requirements.  The MFDA has established a risk adjusted capital standard for mutual fund dealers.  Its formula is designed to provide advance warning of a member encountering difficulties.  If a mutual fund dealer falls below specified levels, then restrictions would apply until rectified, including not being able to act on certain matters without prior written consent from the MFDA.
 PFSL Investments Canada sales representatives are required to be registered in the provinces and territories in which they do business, including regulation by the Autorité des marchés financiers in Quebec, and are also subject to regulation by the MFDA. These regulators have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business and impose censures or fines for failure to comply with the law or regulations.
 PFSL Fund Management in Canada is registered as an Investment Fund Manager in connection with our Concert™ Series mutual funds and is regulated by provincial securities commissions.
 16

PFSL Fund Management is required to file quarterly and annual financial statements with the Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”) prepared to meet the requirements of National Instrument 31-103, Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations, based on the financial reporting framework specified in National Instrument 52-107, Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards.  PFSL Fund Management is required to maintain a minimum level of capital and file its quarterly and annual calculation of excess working capital with the OSC. As an investment fund manager, PFSL Fund Management is required to file periodic reports with provincial and territorial securities commissions throughout Canada for its Concert™ Series mutual funds.  Such reports include semi-annual and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
 As the segregated funds are separate accounts of Primerica Life Canada, the segregated funds are also regulated by OSFI and included as part of the quarterly and annual financial statement filings for Primerica Life Canada.  In addition, the segregated funds are also subject to the guidelines set out by the CLHIA.
 Other Laws and Regulations. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.
 U.S. federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions, including insurance companies, to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer financial information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of consumer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Similarly, federal and state laws and regulations also govern the disclosure and security of consumer health information. In particular, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulate the disclosure and use of protected health information by health insurers and others (including certain life insurers), the physical and procedural safeguards employed to protect the security of that information and the electronic storage and transmission of such information. Congress and state legislatures are expected to consider additional legislation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information.
 The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (“FCAC”), a Canadian federal regulatory body, is responsible for ensuring that federally regulated financial institutions, which include Primerica Life Canada and PFSL Investments Canada, comply with federal consumer protection laws and regulations, voluntary codes of conduct and their own public commitments. The Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (“FINTRAC”) is Canada’s financial intelligence unit. Its mandate includes ensuring that entities subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act comply with reporting, recordkeeping and other obligations under that act. We are also subject to privacy laws under the jurisdiction of federal and provincial privacy commissioners, anti-money laundering laws enforced by FINTRAC and OSFI, and the consumer complaints provisions of federal insurance laws under the mandate of the FCAC, which requires insurers to belong to a complaints ombud-service and file a copy of their complaints handling policy with the FCAC.
 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive environment with respect to the sale of financial products and the retention of the more productive members of the sales force. Competitors with respect to our term life insurance products consist both of stock and mutual insurance companies, as well as other financial intermediaries. Competitive factors affecting the sale of life insurance products include the level of premium rates, benefit features, risk selection practices, compensation of sales representatives and financial strength ratings from ratings agencies such as A.M. Best.
 In offering our securities products, sales representatives compete with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers and direct channels, including wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, insurers, banks, asset managers, registered investment advisors, mutual fund companies and other direct distributors. The mutual funds that we offer face competition from other mutual fund families and alternative investment products, such as exchange-traded funds, while our managed investment programs compete with other fee-based advisory services offered by financial services firms. Our annuity products compete with products from numerous other companies. Competitive factors affecting the sale of annuity products include price, product features, investment performance, commission structure, perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, service, and distribution capabilities. 
 Information Technology and Information Security 
 Our business is dependent on maintaining a secure, confidential environment for clients, sales representatives, employees and other partners’ information. Data security and privacy are becoming increasingly important as we depend more and more on Internet-centric and mobile technologies to conduct business and bring solutions to our clients who entrust their data to us. We have built a sophisticated set of information technology platforms to support our clients, operations and sales force. Our data center houses an enterprise-class IBM mainframe that serves as the repository for all client and sales force data and operates as a database server for our distributed environment. This infrastructure also supports a combination of local and remote recovery solutions that are continually tested to ensure we can resume business in the event of a disaster. Our business applications, many of which are proprietary, are supported by experienced application developers and data center staff at our main campus. Our information security teams provide internal services that include project consulting, threat assessments and management, application and infrastructure assessments, secure configuration management, and information security administration. We utilize, continually assess, and update our technical 
 17

tools and process to industry norms, which by way of example include multiple external threat detection services, external Security Operations Centers, host-based threat detections and prevention, application and infrastructure firewalls and prevention systems, sophisticated assessment and patching systems, and multi-factor controls.  
 
We have developed a comprehensive information security risk management program and policies governing privacy and data protection that apply to all business lines and subsidiaries. We have an active Cyber Security Steering Committee (“Steering Committee”) composed of several of the Company’s top executives, including the Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel, Chief Compliance and Risk Officer, Chief Information Officer, and the Chief Governance Officer, among others. The Steering Committee, which holds quarterly meetings, coordinates corporate security initiatives to enable us to optimize spending, manage infrastructure, and minimize security risk. The Steering Committee also provides high-level guidance on technology and security related issues of importance to the Company. We also developed a special cybersecurity program for New York licensees, in connection with the new cybersecurity regulations issued by the NYDFS, that includes information security, compliance training, and incident response planning. As part of the program, we completed a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment, which we update annually.
 
We continually assess information security risks and perform recurring internal and external audits. In 2018, we began a triennial cyber maturity assessment process with a specialized external partner, where they evaluate the actual level of maturity of each of our cyber-related processes against the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. The assessment provides unique insights of our maturity in each area, compared to a large comparable set of firms, to further assist in making strategic investments in each area of risk and control. We also manage regularly scheduled external penetration tests of our infrastructure and application logic against emerging security threats and best practices.  Employees receive regular alerts advising them of the most relevant data security risks as well as privacy-related risks and procedures. Employees and third parties with access are required to receive cyber-related training, with certain positions requiring additional, specialized training. Employees are also subject to quarterly phishing tests.
 
We have an Incident Response Plan (“Plan”) that is reviewed and updated regularly.  Under this Plan, our Incident Response Team consists of employees from our information security, legal, compliance, public relations, and business teams.  This Plan is designed to help us identify and promptly respond to information security incidents, contain, eradicate and recover from such incidents, notify affected parties and, where appropriate, notify government and regulatory authorities. This Plan documents the roles and responsibilities of our personnel and third-party vendors in responding to information security incidents, including when and to whom incidents should be reported based on level of severity.  On a semi-annual basis, the team undertakes facilitator-led trainings and simulations of information security incidents.  We also maintain cyber insurance coverage.
 
The reporting of all cyber-related risks and assessments is ongoing to senior management and to our Board of Directors, and our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for our cyber security program pursuant to our Plan.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,899 full-time employees in the United States and 267 full-time employees in Canada. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had 533 on-call employees in the United States and 68 on-call employees in Canada who provided services on an as-needed hourly basis. None of our employees is a member of any labor union, and we have never experienced any business interruption as a result of any labor disputes.
