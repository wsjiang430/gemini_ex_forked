--------+---------

OUR COMPANY 
 Installed Building Products, Inc. (IBP), a Delaware corporation formed on October 28, 2011, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company and we, us and our) primarily install insulation, waterproofing, fire-stopping, fireproofing, garage doors, rain gutters, window blinds, shower doors, closet shelving and mirrors and other products for residential and commercial builders located in the continental United States.     
 We offer our portfolio of services from our national network of over 175 branch locations serving all 48 continental states and the District of Columbia. Each of our branches has the capacity to serve all of our end markets. We believe we have the number one or two market position for new single-family insulation installation in more than half of the markets in which we operate based on permits issued in those markets. We are committed to delivering quality installation with a commitment to safety, corporate social responsibility and total customer satisfaction. 
 Our business began in 1977 with one location in Columbus, Ohio. In the late 1990s, we began our acquisition strategy with the goal of creating a national platform. Since 1999, we have successfully completed and integrated over 140 acquisitions, which has allowed us to generate significant scale and to diversify our product offerings while expanding into some of the most attractive new construction markets in the United States. We believe we are well positioned to continue to profitably grow our business due to our strong balance sheet, liquidity and acquisition strategy. For a further discussion of our industry and trends affecting our industry, please refer to Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Key Factors Affecting our Operating Results, in this Form 10-K.
OUR OPERATIONS 
 We manage all aspects of the installation process for our customers, from our direct purchase and receipt of materials from national manufacturers to our timely supply of materials to job sites and quality installation. Installation of insulation is a critical phase in the construction process, as certain interior work cannot begin until the insulation phase passes inspection. 
Insulation 
 Overview 
 We are one of the largest new residential insulation installers in the United States based on our internal estimates. Insulation installation comprised approximately 66% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We handle every stage of the installation process, including material procurement, project scheduling and logistics, multi-phase professional installation and quality inspection. 
Insulation Materials 
 We offer a wide range of insulation materials consisting of: 
 

 | Fiberglass and Cellulose Insulation  Fiber glass insulation is made of fibrous glass that is held together by a thermoset resin creating insulating air pockets. It typically contains an average of 50% recycled content. It is primarily available in two forms: batts (also referred to as blankets) and loosefill (also referred to as blown in). Fiberglass is the most widely used residential insulation material in the United States. Cellulose insulation is made primarily of paper and cardboard and has a very high recycled content. Cellulose is only available in loosefill form and is blown into the structure with

specialized equipment. Fiberglass and cellulose insulation accounted for approximately 85% of our insulation sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Spray Foam Insulation  Spray foam insulation, which is generally a polyurethane foam, is applied at a job site by mixing two chemical components together in specialized application equipment. While typically having the highest insulating value per inch and sealing effectiveness of all insulation materials that we offer, spray foam is also typically the most expensive on an installed basis. Spray foam insulation accounted for approximately 15% of our insulation sales for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Insulation Installation Applications 
 Local building codes typically require the installation of insulation in multiple areas of a structure. Each of these areas is frequently referred to as a phase of the insulation installation process and requires a separate trip to the job site by our installers at different points in the construction of a structure. Building practice and the inspection process differ geographically and require our involvement at different times during the construction process. We assist the builders with coordinating inspections. We install insulation and sealant materials in many areas of a structure, including: 

 | Basement and Crawl Space  These spaces often account for the second most energy loss in a residential structure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Building Envelope  We insulate the exterior walls of both residential and commercial structures by applying insulation on the wall or between the studs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Attic  We insulate the attics of new and existing residential structures. The attic is the area where the most energy may be lost in a home.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Acoustical  Many builder or architect specifications call for acoustical insulation for sound reduction purposes in both residential and commercial structures. This product is generally installed in the interior walls to minimize sound transmission.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In each of these applications, we typically use fiberglass batts, except in attic installations where we typically install loosefill fiberglass or cellulose.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Waterproofing 
 Some of our locations install waterproofing, caulking and moisture protection systems for commercial and industrial construction projects. We offer a variety of waterproofing options, including, but not limited to, sheet and hot applied waterproofing membranes, deck coating systems, bentonite systems and air & vapor systems. The installation and service of waterproofing comprised approximately 7% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Shower Doors, Closet Shelving and Mirrors 
 Some of our locations install a variety of shower enclosures, ranging from basic sliding door designs to complex custom designs. We have the ability to meet our customers diverse needs by customizing shower enclosures by size and style according to their specifications, including framing, hardware and glass options. We design and install closet shelving systems in select markets utilizing some of the highest quality products available from national brands. We also offer standard and custom designed mirrors for our customers. Shower doors, closet shelving and mirror installations comprised approximately 7% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 Garage Doors 
 Some of our locations install and service garage doors and openers for new residential construction builders, homeowners and commercial customers. We offer a variety of options from some of the best-known garage door brands. We offer steel, aluminum, wood and vinyl garage doors as well as opener systems. Unlike the other products we install, the garage door business has an ongoing aftermarket service component, which represented almost one-third of the net revenue resulting from garage doors for the year ended December 31, 2018. The installation and service of garage doors comprised approximately 6% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Rain Gutters 
 Some of our locations install a wide range of rain gutters, which direct water from a homes roof away from the structure and foundation. Rain gutters are typically constructed from aluminum or copper and are available in a wide variety of colors, shapes and widths. They are generally assembled on the job site using specialized equipment. The installation of rain gutters comprised approximately 3% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Window Blinds 
 Some of our locations install different types of window blinds, including cordless blinds, shades and shutters. The installation of window blinds comprised approximately 2% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Other Building Products 
 Some of our locations install other complementary building products, none of which is an individually significant percentage of net revenue. Installation of other building products comprised approximately 9% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We seek to attract and retain customers through exceptional customer service, superior installation quality, broad service offerings and competitive pricing. Our strategy is centered on building and maintaining strong customer relationships. We also capitalize on cross-selling opportunities from existing customer relationships and identifying situations where customers may benefit from more than one of our installation service offerings. By executing this strategy, we believe we can continue to generate incremental sales volumes with new and existing customers. 
 Experienced sales and service professionals are important to our customer growth and increasing our profitability. Retaining and motivating local employees has been an important component of our acquisition and operating strategies. As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 600 sales professionals and our sales force has spent an average of almost a decade with our operations. The local sales staff, which is generally led by the branch manager, is responsible for maintaining relationships with our customers. These local teams work diligently to increase sales by supporting our existing customers with excellent service and value while also pursuing new customers with competitive offerings. In addition to the efforts of our sales staff, we market our product and service offerings on the internet, in the local yellow pages, on the radio and through advertisements in trade journals. We primarily conduct our marketing using local trademarks and trade names.

 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES 
 We seek to differentiate ourselves in areas we believe we have a competitive advantage, including: 
 National scale with a local presence. Our national scale gives us access to the best products, training and innovation available, while our local teams provide best in class installation services and outstanding customer service. Our customers generally select their building products installer based on quality and timeliness of service, knowledge of local building codes, product application expertise, pricing, relationships and reputation in the market. For these reasons, we emphasize the importance of developing and maintaining customer relationships at the local level and rely heavily on the knowledge and experience of our branch management and staff. 
 Diversified product lines. Diversifying our product line offerings provides us opportunity to increase sales for each contract and leverage our branch costs to improve profitability. We continue to form synergies by taking advantage of cross-selling opportunities with our existing customers in markets where we have multiple lines of business. 
 Engaged employees. We offer competitive benefits to our employees to ensure an engaged workforce. In addition to offering certain benefits to most employees, including medical insurance, 401k and paid time off benefits, we also offer longevity stock awards, financial wellness training and savings matching in order to recruit and retain employees. Opportunity for professional growth, training and advancement are encouraged. 
 Financial strength. We believe that we are among the most financially sound companies in our industry. We place an emphasis on having a strong balance sheet which allows us to focus on our strategic initiatives and pursue growth opportunities using our proven acquisition strategy, drive profitability and generate cash. We believe that we are well positioned to properly manage most unanticipated cash flow variations and the seasonality of our business. 
 Execution excellence. We believe that our ability to consistently complete our installations within a customers production schedule is recognized by our customers and is a key component of our high level of service. We have a proven track record of customer satisfaction in managing all aspects of the installation process for our customers. Throughout the construction process, our branch sales and supervisory staff and installation teams make frequent site visits to ensure timely and proper installation and to provide general service support. We believe a high level of service is valued by our customers and generates customer loyalty. 
 Broad customer base. We benefit from a customer base which includes production and custom homebuilders, multi-family and commercial construction firms and homeowners. We continue to enhance our longstanding relationships with some of the largest builders in the country. 
 Relationship with suppliers. We have a long standing relationship with many of the manufacturers of the materials we install. This often allows us to negotiate preferred supply contract terms. 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 We believe our geographic footprint, long-standing relationships with national insulation manufacturers, streamlined value chain and proven track record of successful acquisitions provides us with opportunities for continued growth in our existing markets and expansion into new markets. We believe we are well positioned to further improve our profitability and results in 2019 and we will continue to emphasize the following strategic business objectives in 2019: 

 | capitalize on the new residential and commercial construction markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | capitalize on our ability to cross-sell products through existing markets as well as new markets entered as a result of acquisitions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continue to strengthen our market share position by working with the best customers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 


 
 | pursue value enhancing acquisitions by being disciplined in our approach to valuations and pricing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enhance profitability from our operating leverage and national scale; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | continue organic expansion of the commercial end market in existing geographies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 However, we can provide no assurance that the positive trends reflected in our recent financial and operating results will continue in 2019. 
 QUALITY CONTROL AND SAFETY 
 Our quality control process starts with the initial proposal. Our sales staff and managers are knowledgeable about our service offerings and scope of work. They are trained on manufacturers guidelines as well as state and local building codes. Our quality control programs emphasize onsite inspections, training by manufacturers and various certification programs. 
 We consider risk management and safety to be a core business objective. Significant staffing, funding and other resources are allocated to our management that enhances quality and safety for our employees and our customers. Our branch managers are held accountable for the safety of employees and quality of workmanship at their locations. We provide our employees with ongoing training and development programs necessary to improve work quality and safety performance. 
 CUSTOMERS 
 We serve a broad group of national, regional and local homebuilders, multi-family and commercial construction firms, individual homeowners and repair and remodeling contractors. Our top ten customers, which are a combination of national and regional builders, accounted for approximately 14% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. No single customer accounted for more than 4% of net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
BACKLOG 
 Certain of our contracts are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. When the percentage-of-completion method is used, we estimate the costs to complete individual contracts and record as revenue that portion of the total contract price that is considered complete based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to total anticipated costs. The costs of earned revenue include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and repairs. Backlog represents the transaction price for contracts for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential modifications. Backlog is not a guarantee of future revenues as contractual commitments may change. There can be no assurance that backlog will result in revenues within the expected timeframe, if at all. We estimate backlog was $88.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and we estimated it to be $80.8 million as of December 31, 2017. 
SUPPLIERS 
 We have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers and have not experienced any significant disruption in the supply of any of the primary materials we purchase and install. As one of the largest purchasers of insulation in the United States, we believe that we maintain particularly strong relationships with the largest manufacturers of these products. The proximity of certain of our branch locations to insulation manufacturers facilities provides additional mutual benefits, including opportunities for cost savings and joint planning regarding future production. Due to the limited number of large fiberglass insulation manufacturers, our three largest suppliers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 39% of all material purchases for the year ended December 31, 2018. We also believe that we maintain good relationships with suppliers of the non-insulation

5 


  products we install. We have found that using multiple suppliers ensures a stable source of materials and favorable purchasing terms as suppliers compete to gain and maintain our business. In addition, our national purchasing volumes provide leverage with suppliers as we pursue additional purchasing synergies. 
 SEASONALITY 
 We tend to have higher sales during the second half of the year as our homebuilder customers complete construction of homes placed under contract for sale in the traditionally stronger spring selling season. In addition, some of our larger branches operate in states impacted by winter weather and, as such, experience a slowdown in construction activity during the first quarter of the calendar year. This winter slowdown contributes to traditionally lower sales and profitability in our first quarter. 
 The composition and level of our working capital typically change during periods of increasing sales as we carry more inventory and receivables, although these changes are generally offset in part by higher trade payables to our suppliers. Working capital levels increase in the summer and fall seasons due to higher sales during the peak of residential construction activity. Typically, the subsequent collection of receivables and reduction in inventory levels during the winter months has positively impacted cash flow. In the past, we have from time to time utilized our borrowing availability under our credit facilities to cover short-term working capital needs. 
 COMPETITION 
 We believe that competition in our industry is based on quality and timeliness of service, knowledge of local building codes, pricing, relationships and reputation in the market. The building products installation industry is highly fragmented across all of the various products that we install, with the insulation industry being the most consolidated of our products. Our competitors include one other large national contractor, several large regional contractors and numerous local contractors. We expect to continue to effectively compete in our local markets given our long-standing customer relationships, access to capital, tenure and quality of local staff, quality installation reputation and competitive pricing. 
EMPLOYEES 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 7,700 employees, consisting of approximately 5,450 installers, approximately 600 sales professionals, approximately 500 production personnel and approximately 1,150 administrative and management personnel. Approximately 30 of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike, and we believe that we have good relationships with our employees. 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
 JobCORE is our web-enabled internal software technology designed to enhance the effectiveness of our operations and management. In addition, we typically integrate jobCORE into our acquired operations. The jobCORE software provides in-depth operational and financial performance data from individual branches to the corporate office. JobCORE provides our branch managers and our salespeople with an important operational tool for monitoring branch level performance. It assists management in assessing important business questions, including customer analysis, sales staff analysis, branch analysis and other operating activities. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 We possess intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade names and know-how and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. In particular, we maintain registered trademarks and trade names, the majority of which are the trademarks and trade names under which many of our local branches operate. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any one of our trademarks or trade names, we believe that our

  trademarks and trade names are important to the development and conduct of our business as well as to the local marketing of our services. We also maintain domain name registrations for each of our local branch websites. We make efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, although the actions we take may be inadequate to prevent others from using similar intellectual property. In addition, third parties may assert claims against our use of intellectual property and we may be unable to successfully resolve such claims. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS 
 The Department of Energy, or DOE, states that over half of the energy used in the average American home is for heating and cooling due to many homes not having proper insulation. Per an insulation fact sheet provided by the DOE, inadequate insulation and air leakage are leading causes of energy waste in most homes. Through insulating homes and commercial structures, our industry promotes energy efficiency. Our loose-fill cellulose insulation is manufactured from recycled waste paper and our fiberglass insulation is made from recycled glass which helps reuse resources and reduce our global footprint. 
 We are committed to socially responsible corporate practices. Through charitable donations and volunteer opportunities, we give back to the communities we serve. We also provide longevity stock awards and financial wellness training to our employees. 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, workplace safety, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We strive to operate in accordance with applicable laws, codes and regulations. 
 Our transportation operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, which has broad administrative powers. We are also subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. In addition, vehicle dimension and weight and driver hours of service are subject to both federal and state regulation. Our operations are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Labors Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, which has broad administrative powers regarding workplace and jobsite safety. 
 Our operations and properties are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials, substances, waste and petroleum products and the investigation, remediation, removal and monitoring of the presence or release of such materials, substances, waste and petroleum products, including at currently or formerly owned or occupied premises and off-site disposal locations. We have not previously incurred material costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. However, we could be subject to material costs, liabilities or claims relating to environmental compliance in the future, especially in the event of changes in existing laws and regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement. 
 As the nature of our business involves the use or handling of certain potentially hazardous or toxic substances, including spray foam applications and lead-based paint, we may be held liable for claims alleging injury or damage resulting from the release of or exposure to such substances, as well as claims relating to the presence of mold, fungal growth and moisture intrusion alleged in connection with our business activities. In addition, as owners and lessees of real property, we may be held liable for, among other things, releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products on, at, under or emanating from currently or formerly owned or operated properties, or any off-site disposal locations, or for any known or newly discovered environmental conditions at or relating to any of our properties, including those arising from activities conducted by previous occupants or at adjoining properties, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such release. We may be required to investigate, remove, remediate or monitor the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products and may be held liable by a governmental entity for fines and penalties or to any third parties for damages, including for bodily injury, property damage and natural resource damage in connection with the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products.

 To date, costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to pollution or the protection of human health and safety, the environment and natural resources have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results, and we do not anticipate incurring material expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations in the current fiscal year. 
 In conjunction with our lease agreements and other transactions, we often provide reasonable and customary indemnities relating to various matters, including environmental issues. To date, we have not had to pay a material amount pursuant to any such indemnification obligations. 
 In addition, our suppliers are subject to various laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. With our purchase of a cellulose manufacturer in November 2018, we are subject to similar laws and regulations that apply to our suppliers.
