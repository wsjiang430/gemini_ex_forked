Item 1. Business
Company Overview 

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in February 2021 as a spin-off from Singlepoint Inc. in April 2021. We offer nicotine-free and tobacco-free alternatives to traditional cigarettes and vaping products. Our manufacturers use state of the art manufacturing in the United States and a blend of all-natural ingredients to provide smokers aged 21+ an alternative to traditional cigarettes that does not contain nicotine or tobacco, and promote health benefits such as pain management, reduced anxiety and enhanced wakefulness. Our smokable hemp cigarettes are an alternative for customers that currently smoke or want to quit smoking nicotine. All our hemp cigarettes are manufactured with 100% premium hemp flower and are nicotine-free, tobacco-free and organically grown – free of pesticides and other contaminants. Our key customers comprise distributors and retail customers, including convenience stores, smoke shops and individual purchasers.

We are focused on increasing our retail footprint concentrating on regional expansion in addition to continuing to grow our online presence and retail distribution network. We sell our products directly online through our website, www.1606hemp.com, and ship them directly to anywhere within the United States. Our products are also sold in approximately 300 retail stores. 

With our corporate headquarters located in Phoenix, AZ and our executive team experienced in tobacco sales, distribution, commercialization, and marketing, we believe our product “1606 Original Hemp” is positioned to become the market leader in the smokable industrial hemp cigarette marketplace. 

We have released four primary flavor variants namely Original, Smooth, Menthol, and Mango. Original is a full-flavored product which has been developed to closely emulate the taste experience of a regular tobacco cigarette. Smooth has been developed to produce a flavor profile which is milder in taste. Menthol has been developed to mimic the taste profile of a mentholated tobacco cigarette. Mango has been developed to produce a product that appeals to consumers that want a flavored product. 1606 will market its products under the 1606 Hemp brand for the Original Hemp product and under Zero for the product that has no Marijuana smell. Through the application of a flavoring treatment, they can completely transform the raw material into a finished product that tastes and smells similar to tobacco when combusted. This material is referred to as Base Cigarette Material (“BCM”). Similarly, to fine-cut tobacco, BCM is derived entirely from plant matter, however BCM is fundamentally different from fine-cut tobacco in that it has no tobacco content whatsoever. As such, BCM contains no nicotine, is non-addictive, and undergoes substantially different processing than fine-cut tobacco. This process forms a significant part of the value of Zero brand and is a closely guarded trade secret.

Distribution

Through a combination of online, in-store, and digital out-of-home campaigns targeted towards smokers aged 21 or older, the Company has cultivated considerable interest in 1606 across the United States.

We have used our interactive website, 1606hemp.com, for e-commerce sales of 1606 hemp to consumers throughout the United States. The site uses articles and scientific studies to inform the consumer of the benefits of using hemp instead of tobacco and nicotine. Customers are then able to purchase packs and cartons directly from the website and have them shipped to them throughout the U.S. excluding Idaho. 

Our Strategy

The current market for combustible (smokable) products worldwide is valued at $932 billion. The combustible market includes traditional cigarettes, cigars, electronic vapes, and combustible hemp products, but has historically been dominated by traditional cigarettes, which account for 75% of the worldwide tobacco sales. The CDC states that 34 million American adults currently smoke cigarettes and over 70% have some desire to quit. 

While the cannabidiol (“CBD”) market has many products, the combustible market has a smaller number of competitors of which 1606 is one. Grandview Research has shown that the combustible market is projected to increase by 1.3% through the year 2028, with a growing smokable hemp segment as smoking hemp is becoming more acceptable in mainstream society for those who smoke and for its many health benefits. In fact, Hemp Industry Daily reports tobacco smokers are 191% more likely to use hemp pre-rolls than the general population. Approximately 29% of cigarette smokers have indicated interested in smokable hemp. Our strategy is to capitalize on the current growing demand for smokable hemp by offering nicotine-free, tobacco-free and organically grown hemp that commands premium pricing for all of our distributed and proprietary branded products. Moreover, we leverage our impressive social media following to selectively e-market to customers that ordered our products and people engaged in the business of smokables distribution and sales.

After examining the sales landscape for the past 18 months, we believe our prices reflect the best value to customers in terms of price to quality and price to scale to a national market. 

Products

We distribute and market industrial grade smokable filtered hemp, containing less than 0.3% THC levels in accordance with the Farm Bill passed in 2018. We offer pre-rolled hemp cigarettes in the traditional 20-pack casing as well as a single stick offered in a plastic casing that provides customers an opportunity to try the product at a lower price point before buying the 20 pack. We have also engineered an innovative six-pack display that can be placed directly on the point of sales counter. 
Our Competitive Strengths

When compared to producers of hemp cigarettes, our product is unique in that the products made by these other companies do not closely resemble tobacco cigarettes in their taste, smell, or other experiential attributes. Likewise, when compared to producers of tobacco cigarettes, our product is unique in that it is designed to closely replicate the user experience of these products, though it does so with no tobacco or nicotine content. Thus, these are not necessarily “direct” competitors as the companies in question produce either hemp cigarettes which do not taste or smell like tobacco, or tobacco cigarettes with nicotine.

We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to Company’s success and differentiate us from our competitors:


· | An established distribution network through various sales channels; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Sustainable, organically grown hemp free of pesticides and other contaminants; 
· | Although we face competition from other manufacturers and competitors, we believe that our products will appeal to the consumer;
· | Premium customer service; 
· | A management team experienced in tobacco sales, distribution, commercialization, and marketing; 

Employees

We have two full-time employees, which includes our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer. We retain the services of additional personnel on an independent contractor basis. We do not have any part-time employees but work with several consultants.
Corporate Information

Our principal offices are located at 2425 E. Camelback Rd., Suite 150, Phoenix, AZ, 85016. Our main telephone number is (602) 481-1544. Our website address is www.1606hemp.com. We have not incorporated by reference into this prospectus the information that can be accessed through our website and you should not consider it to be part of this prospectus. 
Government Regulation

The 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law on December 20, 2018 and it removed hemp from the CSA, which means it is no longer a controlled substances under federal law.

The 2018 Farm Bill changed federal policy regarding industrial hemp, including the removal of hemp from the Controlled Substances Act and the consideration of hemp as an agricultural product. The 2018 Farm Bill expanded the definition of industrial hemp from the last 2014 Farm Bill. The 2018 Farm Bill also allows states and tribes to submit a plan and apply for primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp in their state or in their tribal territory. A state plan must include certain requirements, such as keeping track of land, testing methods, and disposal of plants or products that exceed the allowed THC concentration.

Additionally, hemp is no longer classified as a Schedule 1 drug. Previously, the 2014 Farm Bill defined industrial hemp and allowed for state departments of agriculture or universities to grow and produce hemp as part of research or pilot programs. Specifically, the law allowed universities and state departments of agriculture to grow or cultivate industrial hemp if: (1) “the industrial hemp is grown or cultivated for purposes of research conducted under an agricultural pilot program or other agricultural or academic research; and (2) the growing or cultivating of industrial hemp is allowed under the laws of the state in which such institution of higher education or state department of agriculture is located, and such research occurs.”

To comply with state regulations for commercial and research programs, growers must be licensed, registered, or permitted with the state agency overseeing the program. Requirements for registration, licenses and permits might include:


· | Criminal background checks; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Periodic renewals, usually every one-to-three years; 
· | Registering the location or Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of grow sites; 
· | Record keeping and reporting any sales or distributions including to whom it was sold or distributed, including processors; and/or 
· | Documentation from the state agency or institution of higher education to prove the grower is participating in an approved program.


The state agencies overseeing these programs are typically authorized to conduct inspections, test the plants and review records. State agencies may revoke licenses and impose civil and criminal penalties against growers who violate regulations.

Any activities involving industrial hemp that fall within the following would require a license: cultivation (including plant breeding/propagation); sale; importation; exportation; cleaning; preparing (conditioning); and, processing (including rendering non-viable and producing derivatives/products).

The USDA announced October 29, 2019, the “U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program”. The interim final rule governs the production of hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill. The interim final rule does not affect industrial hemp that was or is being cultivated under the 2014 Farm Bill programs. That industrial hemp remains subject to the requirements of the 2014 Farm Bill. Key take-aways from the USDA 161 page guidelines are as follows:


· | Federal Pre-emption: The USDA re-confirmed that the 2018 Farm Bill pre-empts state law regarding interstate transport of hemp. Specifically, States and Indian Tribes may not prevent the movement of hemp through their States or Territories even if they prohibit its production. States that regulate hemp must do so in a manner that is at least as strict as the 2018 Farm Bill and the USDA federal plan. Importantly, they are permitted to regulate hemp in a manner that is more stringent than the USDA plan. This includes making the cultivation and commerce of hemp and hemp products unlawful, though it is unlawful for a state or Indian Tribe to prohibit the transport hemp through its borders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Seed Certification Hemp: The USDA will not establish a federal seed certification program. The USDA acknowledged the magnitude of this undertaking and has decided it is not feasible at this time.

· | “Total” THC: The definition of hemp is still based on the delta-9-THC concentration. However, the testing for THC will now include a calculation of THC-A, referred to in the Rule as “potential THC”, contained in a sample. If a testing method, such as gas chromatography, is used that converts THC-A to THC, (a “decarboxylation” method) then the sample must test at or below the 0.3% threshold. If a testing method is used that does not use heat, such as liquid chromatography, and thus does not convert THC-A to THC, the THC-A concentration will be multiplied by a factor of .877, and that value will be added to the THC concentration, which again must test at or below the 0.3% threshold.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | “Acceptable Hemp THC Level” and “Measurement of Uncertainty” (MU): These are new concepts for hemp introduced by the USDA interim rule. The purpose of these concepts is to acknowledge that there is a margin of error with testing, even with the most accurate testing methods. In order for a test to be deemed valid under the rule, the testing facility must provide a “Measurement of Uncertainty” (MU), which roughly correlates to a “margin of error”. The margin of error figure is added to, and subtracted from, the figure that represents the THC concentration to create a range. The 0.3% must fall somewhere within the range. 
· | “Negligence” Standard. The USDA plan creates a framework to protect licensees from criminal prosecution when their failure to produce a compliant hemp crop is the result of negligence. 
· | 15 Day Pre-Harvest Testing Window: Cultivators must submit samples to a certified lab fifteen (15) days prior to the estimated harvest date. Licensees must allow state and local law enforcement unfettered access to the cultivation sites. 


Uncertainty surrounding existing and future laws and regulations may impede our services and increase the cost of providing such services. The cannabis industry, including companies which sell products containing CBD, faces very uncertain regulation by the federal government. While the federal government has for several years chosen to not intervene in the cannabis business conducted legally within the states that have legislated such activities, there is, nonetheless, potential that the federal government may at any time choose to begin enforcing its laws against the manufacture, possession, or use of cannabis-based products such as CBD. Similarly, there is the possibility that the federal government may enact legislation or rules that authorize the manufacturing, possession or use of those products under specific guidelines. Local, state and federal cannabis laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations. In the event the federal government was to tighten its regulation of the industry, we would likely suffer a material adverse effect on our business, including substantial losses.

In addition, we expect that there will be a constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the CBD industry which could affect our operations. Local, state and federal hemp laws and regulations may be broad in scope and subject to changing interpretations. These changes may require us to incur substantial costs associated with legal and compliance fees and ultimately require us to alter our business plan. Furthermore, violations of these laws, or alleged violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business.

Hemp Cigarettes

Hemp cigarettes enjoy a new, semi-regulated market. The product is early in the consumer adoption stage, so new companies have a chance to compete based on service, quality, and niche, and not just on distribution and funding.

Currently, hemp cigarettes are not subject to the same levels of regulation as tobacco cigarettes, however there are a series of bills that are currently circulating throughout state governments in Indiana, South Carolina and North Carolina regarding the legality of the possession, sale, and consumption of smokable hemp flower. Most products currently on the market are unregulated and made with poor or low quality hemp. This can affect the marketplace, the consumer experience, and bring faster regulation into the space.

Law enforcement has stated that smokable hemp and marijuana are indistinguishable based on smell and looks, thus making critical decisions more difficult as adequate training on this topic has not been provided, and many field tests only decipher the presence of THC rather than the concentration being greater than 0.03%.
