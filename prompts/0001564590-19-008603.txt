--------+---------

General 
 
Inland Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (which we refer to herein as the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) was incorporated on August 24, 2011 to acquire and manage a portfolio of commercial real estate investments located in the United States. We have primarily focused on acquiring retail properties and intend to target a portfolio of 100% grocery-anchored properties as described below.  We have invested in joint ventures and may continue to invest in additional joint ventures or acquire other real estate assets such as office and medical office buildings, multi-family properties and industrial/distribution and warehouse facilities if our management believes the expected returns from those investments exceed that of retail properties. We also may invest in real estate-related equity securities of both publicly traded and private real estate companies, as well as commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”). Our sponsor, Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation, referred to herein as our “Sponsor” or “IREIC,” is an indirect subsidiary of The Inland Group, Inc.  Various affiliates of our Sponsor provide services to us. We are externally managed and advised by IREIT Business Manager & Advisor, Inc., referred to herein as our “Business Manager,” an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of our Sponsor. Our Business Manager is responsible for overseeing and managing our day-to-day operations.  Our properties are managed by Inland Commercial Real Estate Services LLC, referred to herein as our “Real Estate Manager,” an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of our Sponsor.
 
On January 16, 2018, we effected a 1-for-2.5 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock whereby every 2.5 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock were converted into one share of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), all share information presented has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
 
We commenced an initial public “best efforts” offering (the “Offering”) on October 18, 2012, which concluded on October 16, 2015.  We sold 33,534,022 shares of common stock generating gross proceeds of $834.4 million from the Offering.  On March 5, 2019, our board of directors determined an estimated per share net asset value (the “Estimated Per Share NAV”) of our common stock as of December 31, 2018 of $20.12.  The previously estimated per share net asset value of $22.35 as of December 31, 2017 was established on March 20, 2018. 
 
At December 31, 2018, we owned 59 retail properties, totaling 6.9 million square feet. At December 31, 2018, our portfolio had weighted average physical and economic occupancy of 94.1% and 94.7%, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, annualized base rent (“ABR”) per square foot averaged $17.30, $17.16 and $17.25, respectively, for all properties owned. ABR is calculated by annualizing the current, in-place monthly base rent for leases, including any tenant concessions, such as rent abatement or allowances, which may have been granted and excluding ground leases. ABR including ground leases averaged $14.94, $14.81 and $15.13 as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 
On February 11, 2019, our board of directors approved a strategic plan with the goals of providing a liquidity event in the next 24 to 36 months, or sooner, market conditions permitting, most likely through a listing on a public securities exchange. The strategic plan centers around owning a portfolio of 100% grocery-anchored properties with lower exposure to big box retailers. As part of this strategy, our management team and our board of directors will consider the opportunistic sale of certain assets with the goal of redeploying capital into the acquisition of strategically located grocery-anchored centers, as well as the redevelopment of select centers within the current portfolio. In connection with the strategic plan, our board approved amendments to the SRP as further described below under “–Share Repurchase Program,” and the business management agreement with the Business Manager was amended and restated on February 11, 2019 to, among other things, eliminate all future acquisition and disposition fees. There can be no assurance that the strategic plan will not evolve or change over time or that we will be able to successfully implement the strategic plan, including listing our common stock.
 We provide the following programs to facilitate additional investment in our shares and to provide limited liquidity for stockholders.
 Distribution Reinvestment Plan
 
Through the distribution reinvestment plan (“DRP”), we provide stockholders with the option to purchase additional shares from us by automatically reinvesting distributions, subject to certain share ownership restrictions. We do not pay any selling commissions or a marketing contribution and due diligence expense allowance in connection with the DRP. The price per share for shares of common stock purchased under the DRP is equal to the Estimated Per Share NAV unless and until the shares become listed for trading. On March 20, 2018, we reported a new Estimated Per Share NAV of $22.35 and on March 11, 2019, we reported a new Estimated Per Share NAV of $20.12.  Beginning with the first quarter 2019 distribution payable in April, shares sold through the DRP will be at a price equal to $20.12 until we update the Estimated Per Share NAV in 2020.
 Distributions reinvested through the DRP were $19.3 million, $27.1 million and $27.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Share Repurchase Program
 We adopted a share repurchase program (as amended, “SRP”) effective October 18, 2012, under which we are authorized to purchase shares from stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares through a non-cash transfer and who have held their shares for at least one year, if requested, if we choose to purchase them. In the case of repurchases made upon the death of a stockholder or qualifying disability, the one year holding period does not apply. The SRP was amended and restated effective January 1, 2018 to change the processing of repurchase requests from a monthly to a quarterly basis to align with the move to quarterly distributions. On February 11, 2019, our board adopted a second amended and restated SRP (the “A&R SRP”), which will become effective on March 21, 2019. 
 Under the A&R SRP, we are authorized to make ordinary repurchases at a price equal to 80.0% of the “share price,” which is defined in the A&R SRP as an amount equal to the lesser of: (A) $25, as adjusted under certain circumstances, including, among other things, if the applicable shares were purchased from the Company at a discounted price; or (B) the most recently disclosed estimated value per share. Prior to the amendment, we were authorized to make ordinary repurchases at a price ranging from 92.5% to 100% of the “share price.” We may repurchase shares upon a stockholder’s death or qualifying disability at a price equal to 100% of the “share price.” Beginning with repurchases in April 2019, the “share price” will be equal to $20.12 per share until we announce a new Estimated Per Share NAV. Accordingly, ordinary repurchases will be at $16.10 per share and repurchases for death or qualifying disability will be at $20.12 per share.
 The A&R SRP provides our board of directors with the discretion to reduce the funding limit for share repurchases.  Prior to the amendment, the funding for ordinary repurchases was limited to the proceeds from the DRP during a particular quarter.  The A&R SRP limits the dollar amount for any repurchases made by us each calendar quarter to an amount equal to a percentage determined in the sole discretion of our board on a quarterly basis that will not be less than 50% of the net proceeds from the DRP during the applicable quarter.  We continue to limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to 5% of the number of shares outstanding on December 31st of the previous calendar year, as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split. 
 If either or both of the repurchase limitations prevent us from repurchasing all of the shares offered for repurchase during a calendar quarter, we will repurchase shares, on a pro rata basis within each category below, in accordance with the repurchase limitations in the following order: (a) first, all repurchases sought upon a stockholder’s death or qualifying disability and (b) second, all ordinary repurchases. Shares not repurchased due to the pro rata impact will be included in the list of requests in the immediately following calendar quarter, unless the request is withdrawn. The A&R SRP provides that a requesting party must own shares of at least $500 after giving effect to any repurchase by the Company. If a requesting party would fail to maintain this minimum balance after giving effect to any repurchase, we may, in our discretion, repurchase the remaining balance of shares which is less than $500, subject to the 5% share limit described above. The SRP will immediately terminate if our shares become listed for trading on a national securities exchange. In addition, our board of directors, in its sole direction, may, at any time, amend, suspend or terminate the SRP.
 
Repurchases through the SRP were $22.5 million, $21.1 million and $9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our liability related to the SRP was $5.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively, recorded in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Segment Data 
 We currently view our real estate portfolio as one reportable segment in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Accordingly, we did not report any other segment disclosure for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.  For information related to our business segment, reference is made to Note 12 – “Segment Reporting” which is included in our December 31, 2018 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.
Tax Status 
 We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“REIT”) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code”), commencing with the tax year ended December 31, 2013. Commencing with such taxable year, we were organized and began operating in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe we have so qualified. As a result, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain) to its stockholders. We will monitor the business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes. The earnings of any taxable REIT subsidiaries, generally will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax.

Competition 
 The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of commercial properties. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on a property’s occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses.
 We are subject to significant competition in seeking real estate investments and tenants. We compete with many third parties engaged in real estate investment activities including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. 
 Employees
 We do not have any employees. In addition, all of our executive officers are officers of IREIC or one or more of its affiliates and are compensated by those entities, in part, for their services rendered to us. We neither separately compensate our executive officers for their service as officers, nor do we reimburse either our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager for any compensation paid to individuals who also serve as our executive officers, or the executive officers of our Business Manager or its affiliates or our Real Estate Manager; provided that, for these purposes, the corporate secretaries of our Company and our Business Manager are not considered “executive officers.” 
Conflicts of Interest 
 Certain persons performing services for our Business Manager and Real Estate Manager are employees of IREIC or its affiliates, and may also perform services for its affiliates and other IREIC-sponsored entities. These individuals face competing demands for their time and services and may have conflicts in allocating their time between our business and assets and the business and assets of these other entities. IREIC also may face a conflict of interest in allocating personnel and resources among these entities. In addition, conflicts exist to the extent that we acquire properties in the same geographic areas where properties owned by other IREIC-sponsored programs are located. In these cases, a conflict may arise in the acquisition or leasing of properties if we and another IREIC-sponsored program are competing for the same properties or tenants in negotiating leases, or a conflict may arise in connection with the resale of properties if we and another IREIC-sponsored program are selling similar properties at the same time.
 Our charter contains provisions setting forth our ability to engage in certain related party transactions. Our board of directors reviews all of these transactions and, as a general rule, any related party transactions must be approved by a majority of the directors, including a majority of the independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction. Further, we may not engage in certain transactions with entities sponsored by, or affiliated with, IREIC unless a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, finds the transaction to be fair and reasonable and on terms no less favorable to us than those from an unaffiliated party under the same circumstances. Our board has adopted a conflicts of interest policy prohibiting us from engaging in the following types of transactions with IREIC-affiliated entities: 
  
• | purchasing real estate assets from, or selling real estate assets to, any IREIC-affiliated entities (excluding circumstances where an entity affiliated with IREIC, such as Inland Real Estate Acquisitions, LLC (“IREA”), from time to time may enter into a purchase agreement to acquire a property and then assign the purchase agreement to us);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | making loans to, or borrowing money from, any IREIC-affiliated entities (this excludes expense advancements under existing agreements and the deposit of monies in any banking institution affiliated with IREIC); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | investing in joint ventures with any IREIC-affiliated entities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 This policy does not impact agreements or relationships between us and IREIC and its affiliates, including, for example, agreements with our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager that relate to the day-to-day management of our business.

Environmental Matters 
 As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws, rules and regulations adopted by various governmental bodies or agencies. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions. We do not believe that our existing portfolio as of December 31, 2018 will require us to incur material expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations.
