 Item 1. Business.
 Founded in 1980, CCC is a leading provider of innovative cloud, mobile, artificial intelligence (“AI”), telematics, hyperscale technologies and applications for the property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance economy. Our software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform connects trading partners, facilitates commerce, and supports mission-critical, AI-enabled digital workflows. Leveraging decades of deep domain experience, our industry-leading platform processes more than $100 billion in annual transaction value across this ecosystem, digitizing workflows and connecting more than 30,000 companies across the P&C insurance economy, including insurance carriers, collision repairers, parts suppliers, automotive manufacturers, financial institutions and others.
 Our business has been built upon two foundational pillars: automotive insurance claims and automotive collision repair. For decades we have delivered leading software solutions to both the insurance and repair industries, including pioneering Direct Repair Programs (“DRP”) in the United States (“U.S.”) beginning in 1992. DRP connects auto insurers and collision repair shops to create business value for both parties, and requires digital tools to facilitate interactions and manage partner programs. Insurer-to-shop DRP connections have created a strong network effect for CCC’s platform, as insurers and repairers both benefit by joining the largest network to maximize opportunities. This has led to a virtuous cycle in which more insurers on the platform drives more value for the collision shops on the platform, and vice versa.
 We believe we have become a leading insurance and repair SaaS provider in the U.S. by increasing the depth and breadth of our SaaS offerings over many years. Our insurance solutions help insurance carriers manage mission-critical workflows across the claims lifecycle, while building smart, dynamic experiences for their own customers. Our software integrates seamlessly with both legacy and modern systems alike and enables insurers to rapidly innovate on our platform. Our repair solutions help collision repair facilities achieve better performance throughout the collision repair cycle by digitizing processes to drive business growth, streamline operations, and improve repair quality. We have more than 300 insurers on our network, connecting with over 28,000 repair facilities through our multi-tenant cloud platform. We believe our software is the architectural backbone of insurance DRP systems and is the primary driver of material revenue for our collision shop customers and a source of material efficiencies for our insurance carrier customers.
 Our platform is designed to solve the “many-to-many” problem faced by the insurance economy. There are numerous internally and externally developed insurance software solutions in the market today, with the vast majority of applications focused on insurance-only use cases and not on serving the broader insurance ecosystem. We have prioritized building a leading network around our automotive insurance and collision repair pillars to further digitize interactions and maximize value for our customers. We have tens of thousands of companies on our platform that participate in the insurance economy, including insurers, repairers, parts suppliers, automotive manufacturers, and financial institutions. Our solutions create value for each of these parties by enabling them to connect to our vast network to collaborate with other companies, streamline operations, and reduce processing costs and dollars lost through claims management inefficiencies, or claims leakage. Expanding our platform has added new layers of network effects, further accelerating the adoption of our software solutions.
 We have processed more than $1 trillion of historical data across our network, allowing us to build proprietary data assets that leverage insurance claims, vehicle repair, automotive parts and other vehicle-specific information. We believe we are uniquely positioned to provide data-driven insights, analytics, and AI-enhanced workflows that strengthen our solutions and improve business outcomes for our customers. Our AI solutions increase automation across existing insurance and repair processes including vehicle damage detection, claim triage, repair estimating, and intelligent claims review. We deliver real-world AI with more than 100 U.S. auto insurers actively using AI-powered solutions in production environments. We have processed more than 14 million unique claims using CCC deep learning AI as of December 31, 2022, an increase of more than 50% over December 31, 2021.
 One of the primary obstacles facing the P&C insurance economy is increasing complexity. Complexity in the P&C insurance economy is driven by technological advancements, Internet of Things (“IoT”) data, new business models, supply-chain disruption, and changing consumer expectations. We believe digitization plays a critical role in managing this growing complexity while meeting consumer expectations. Our technology investments are focused on digitizing complex processes and interactions across our ecosystem, and we believe we are well positioned to power the P&C insurance economy of the future with our data, network, and platform.
 While our position in the P&C insurance economy is grounded in the automotive insurance sector, the largest insurance sector in the U.S. representing nearly half of Direct Written Premiums (“DWP”), we believe our integrations and cloud platform are capable of driving innovation across the entire P&C insurance economy. Our customers are increasingly looking for CCC to expand its solutions to other parts of their business where they can benefit from our technology, service, and partnership. In response, we are investing in new solutions that we believe will enable us to digitize the entire automotive claims lifecycle, and over time expand into adjacencies including other insurance lines. For example, CCC's acquisition of Safekeep in February 2022 added subrogation solutions that can span insurance lines including automotive, property, and worker's compensation.
 We have strong customer relationships in the end-markets we serve, and these relationships are a key component of our success given the long-term nature of our contracts and the interconnectedness of our network. We have customer agreements with more than 300 insurers (including carriers, self-insurers and other entities processing insurance claims), including 18 of the top 20 automotive insurance carriers in the U.S., based on DWP, and hundreds of regional carriers. We have more than 30,000 total customers, including over 28,000 automotive collision repair facilities (including repairers and other entities that estimate damaged vehicles), more than 4,500 parts suppliers, 13 of the top 15 automotive manufacturers, based on new vehicle sales, and numerous other companies that participate in the P&C insurance economy.
 We generate revenue through the sale of software subscriptions and other revenue, primarily from professional services. We generated $782.4 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 13.7% from the prior year. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $38.4 million, compared to a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $248.9 million, mainly due to $209.9 million of stock-based compensation expense recognized in conjunction with the Business Combination in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.8% year-over-year to $305.4 million.


P&C Insurance Economy
 P&C insurance is one of the largest global industries. The U.S. P&C insurance industry alone serviced approximately $700 billion in DWP in 2021. Insurance is a necessity for the majority of businesses and consumers, and, as a result, the P&C insurance industry has seen steady long-term growth.
 P&C insurers face a number of challenging market dynamics in today’s environment, including increasing customer expectations, competition from new entrants and business models, emerging technologies, labor shortages, and cost pressures. Insurers are often reliant on legacy on-premise systems to assist with policy and claims adjustments and processing, which can be inflexible and costly to maintain, challenging their ability to innovate and respond to market dynamics.
 Further complicating matters, the P&C insurance industry is dependent on the P&C insurance economy, an interconnected economy of industries that interact to service, underwrite, finance, and repair insured assets. Insurance carriers invest in data, systems, services and partnerships to manage the many required collaboration points across these industries. To deliver end-to-end digital workflows and improved customer experiences, technology needs to extend beyond insurance organizations and include its supporting economy, in order to enable the many interactions and handoffs required to process insurance events.
 In the automotive insurance sector, which represents nearly half of the U.S. P&C insurance industry, processing a single event, such as a claim, can require hundreds of micro-transactions across its supporting economy, involving consumers, lenders, collision repair facilities, automotive manufacturers, dealers, parts suppliers, medical providers, vehicle auctions, and others. These transactions depend on extensive hyper-local decisions and data, creating a level of complexity that can increase processing costs as well as the potential for fraud and other forms of claims leakage. For automotive claims, the end result is more than one billion days of cumulative claims cycle time (loss date to claim completion date) in the U.S. each year. For our insurance partners, cycle time is costly, which is one reason why, as of 2022, CCC’s platform is relied upon by 18 of the top 20 auto insurers based on DWP in the U.S. to digitize complexity and improve business outcomes.
 


The complexity seen in one auto claim grows exponentially more difficult to manage at scale, and complexity is continuing to increase across the P&C insurance economy. In the automotive sector, this is due to several converging factors including, without limitation:
 •Vehicle parts proliferation: Repairable parts per auto claim have increased 46% since 2011
 •Internal technology systems: The average lines of software code per new vehicle doubled from 100 million in 2015 to 200 million in 2020
 •Growing connected car capabilities: By 2030, 95% of new vehicles sold globally are expected to be connected
 •Transportation as a Service (“TaaS”) and other new business models: 10% of Transportation Network Company (TNC) users postpone the purchase of a new car due to availability of TNCs
 •Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (“ADAS”) and diagnostics systems: The number of vehicles receiving a diagnostic scan as part of a collision repair has increased 1,375% since 2017
 •Vehicle Electrification and related infrastructure: Globally, electrification represented more than 65% of overall end-use investment in the transport sector in 2021 and is estimated to have increased to more than 74% in 2022
 •Supply chain disruption: More than 80% of Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) members reported supply chain disturbances severely or moderately impacting their business in 2021
 We believe the only way to effectively manage increasing complexity is through digitization. Since our inception over forty years ago, we have focused our technology on what we believe to be our customers’ most complex problems. We have digitized total loss valuations, repair

estimates, DRP programs, shop management functions, repair workflows, medical claims, parts ordering, subrogation, and much more. In the process, we have built integrations and facilitated partnerships that enable information sharing across our vast network of customer companies. Our solutions are well-suited for the next wave of complexity, and we believe these trends will continue to accelerate adoption of CCC’s platform and applications.

Sales and Marketing
 CCC marketing and sales organizations directly engage with decision-makers and industry leaders across the P&C insurance economy to drive software adoption. Our digital marketing provides CCC with a platform to execute highly targeted outreach to tens of thousands of active and prospective clients by customizing communications based on specific client needs or marketplace trends.
 Our sales teams are structured to address the different needs of our markets. For our small business sales efforts, CCC employs a geographically dispersed account team structure to facilitate in-person demos and direct sales, along with an inside sales team. For larger insurance and automotive clients, CCC combines both enterprise and regional account teams with solutions and consulting services to lead marketing and sales efforts. Custom analysis, pilot programs, and highly consultative account teams drive customer software expansion and adoption.
 As a thought leader across the P&C insurance economy, CCC delivers valued data and perspectives to these industries. As the publisher of Crash Course, a robust industry dataset on Auto Physical Damage and Casualty claims trends, CCC engages clients and prospects with custom

content, industry analysis, and unique insights. Monthly reports and trends data underpin our marketing outreach generating awareness in trade journals, industry presentations, and online publications. CCC collaborates with partners, clients, and thought leaders to market our solutions and expand our network. Clients participate with us in industry roundtables, including CCC-hosted advisory councils across each of the industries we serve. Additionally, CCC hosts an invitation-only Industry Conference annually.
 We leverage our strategic partnerships and networks to drive sales and market software functionality. Suppliers and clients on the CCC network, including major parts suppliers, diagnostics service providers, and OEM and insurance partners, help to market CCC software. These co-marketing efforts expand our network and reinforce client value.
 Our Customers
 We believe we have strong customer relationships across the more than 30,000 total customers in the end markets we serve, and these relationships are a key component of our success given the long-term nature of our contracts and interconnectedness of our network.
 We have more than 300 total insurance customers in the U.S., comprised of national carriers and regional carriers. In 2022, our national carrier customers included 18 of the top 20 automotive insurers based on DWP, with average customer relationships spanning more than 10 years, and numerous exclusive arrangements. Our national carrier customers also represent 18 of the top 20 overall P&C insurers in the U.S based on DWP. We work with hundreds of regional carriers, and across all our insurance customers our average contract is approximately three to five years in duration.
 We have more than 28,000 automotive collision repair customers, including national MSOs, regional MSOs, independent repair facilities, and automotive dealers that perform collision repair. We partner with all of the national MSOs across the U.S. Our average repair facility contract is approximately 3 years in duration, though MSO customers can have longer contract terms.
 In addition to insurance and repair, our customers include more than 4,500 parts suppliers, 13 of the top 15 automotive manufacturers as of 2022, and other companies that participate in the P&C insurance economy. Our software solutions and platform are designed to create value for our customers by boosting efficiency, improving cycle time, increasing innovation potential, and enhancing end-customer experiences.
 Competition
 The P&C insurance economy software market is highly competitive and fragmented. This market is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and introductions of new and innovative software solutions. Our competitors vary in size, breadth, and scope of their solutions. Our current principal competitors include the following:
 •Internally developed software: Our large customers have sufficient IT resources to maintain and update their own proprietary internal systems and to invest in new technology capabilities. Often these in-house technology programs will be supported by large-scale consulting firms.
 •P&C insurance software vendors: A number of vendors provide software solutions that are specifically designed to meet the needs of the P&C insurance industry, including core systems providers, underwriting data and software providers, and claims software providers. Some of these vendors have supporting ecosystems that enable integration to third parties to facilitate interaction with the supporting P&C insurance economy.
 •Other ecosystem software vendors: Other established vendors and startups offer software targeting specific needs for certain segments of the P&C insurance economy, such as collision repair facility software solutions and parts e-commerce platforms.
 Competitive factors in our industry will vary across solution and ecosystem segments. The principal competitive factors include software functionality, performance and value delivery, innovation potential, network breadth, implementation and support, and customer references. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of each of these factors.
 Intellectual Property
 We own or have pending patents and patent applications, which generally apply to our software. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 27 issued U.S. patents, which are scheduled to expire between October 2023 and December 2040, and 13 patent applications pending for examination in the U.S.
 In addition, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors and business partners, and employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions. As part of our contracting process with third parties, we use contract terms such as limited licenses, restrictions on use, and confidentiality, as additional measures to protect our intellectual property.
 Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
 We are currently formalizing our approach to ESG to ensure that stakeholder needs and material ESG topics have appropriate strategies and governance in place. To date, we have formed a cross-functional ESG working group, conducted an ESG issues assessment, and performed an inaugural greenhouse gas emissions assessment. We are currently finalizing a formal framework for our ESG program that we will report on in the future. We look forward to enhancing our disclosures for ESG as we continue to make progress on this critical initiative.
 Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,375 employees and 500 contingent employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,250 employees in the U.S. and approximately 125 employees internationally. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not had any work stoppages.
 

We have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our employees, offering a flexible work model that balances business requirements and employee preferences. We believe this approach helped us continue to retain our current employees and remain competitive when hiring future talent.
 Our highly engaged workforce is a result of employees’ collective demonstration of our values—integrity, customer-focus, innovation, inclusion and diversity ("I&D"), and tenacity—as well as our collaborative and results-oriented culture. Our annual performance management process embeds behavioral competencies holding our leaders accountable for maintaining highly engaged teams and supporting the development of others. Every employee is encouraged to work with their manager to create an individual development plan focused on their career aspirations and documenting objectives they will strive to achieve through opportunities such as self-directed e-learning, soft-skill and technical/product training via our Learning Academy, professional certifications, stretch assignments, and our formal mentorship program. We also offer tuition reimbursement for employees who wish to continue their formal education.
Our goal is to hire individuals who share the passion for and commitment to the work we do. We offer a comprehensive compensation and benefits program that includes competitive wages, a 401(k) with match, an Employee Stock Purchase Program, and a holistic wellness program. Recognizing the importance of work/life balance to mental and physical health, we offer an Employee Assistance Program and paid time off (“PTO”) plan that we encourage employees to use. To ensure we are advancing our under-represented hiring, we have partnered with several job boards and technical event-based recruiting companies who help to expand our reach to a broader, more diverse set of candidates. We have a formal internship program, targeting leading universities throughout the Midwest and partnering with under-represented university groups. Through our focus on increasing the diversity of our candidate pool, we increased the number of 2022 new hires from under-represented backgrounds as compared to the prior year.
 We believe a diverse workforce at all levels and an inclusive culture are foundational to our success and will enable us to better serve our customers. We have a Diversity Advisory Council (“DAC”) whose mission is to support the development and execution of our I&D strategy. Through the DAC, we organized several unique cultural/heritage events to celebrate and honor the diversity of our team members and support employee-driven employee resource groups (“ERGs”) – the African American Alliance, the Women’s Network, and the Growing Professionals ERG.
 We recognize that women and people of color continue to be under-represented in the technology and collision repair industries, and that is why we prioritize our corporate giving to those organizations whose mission is to increase access and exposure to careers in these fields. In 2022, we continued our support of Black Girls Code and the Thurgood Marshall College Foundation, as well as the Collision Repair Education Foundation, Collision Industry Foundation, and Women’s Industry Network. We also introduced a company-wide volunteer opportunity with Hour of Code whose mission is to introduce young people to computer science, and initiated sponsorships for local chapters of the National Society of Black Engineers.
