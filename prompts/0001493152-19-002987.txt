General
 
Provectus Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (Provectus or the Company), a Delaware corporation formed in 2002, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new class of drugs based on halogenated xanthenes, which are chemical small molecules, such as Rose Bengal, which has a molecular formula of 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2’,4’,5’,7’-tetraiodofluorescein. Intratumoral (IT) (aka intralesional or IL) injection of PV-10, the first small molecule oncolytic immunotherapy, can yield immunogenic cell death and stimulate tumor-specific reactivity in circulating T cells. PV-10 is undergoing clinical study for adult solid tumor cancers, like melanoma and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and preclinical study for pediatric cancers. Topical application of PH-10, an investigational formulation of Rose Bengal for dermatology, can modulate inflammation. PH-10 is undergoing clinical study for inflammatory dermatoses, like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Pathways significantly improved by PH-10 include published psoriasis transcriptomes and cellular responses mediated by IL-17, IL-22, and interferons.
 
Our approach to drug development comprises two related, complementary, clinical program paths based on the features of our respective investigational drugs and their clinically-rational applicability to different patient populations. In solid tumor cancers for adults, for example, we believe PV-10 has important implications as a single-agent for earlier states of disease (e.g., locally advanced disease; Stage III or earlier), while the combination of PV-10 with other classes of therapy (e.g., immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy) is more appropriate for advanced disease states (e.g., widely metastatic disease; Stage IV).

Oncology (PV-10)
 
We are developing PV-10, a formulation of Rose Bengal, for direct injection into tumors as an investigational oncolytic immunotherapy, where it can (a) destroy injected tumors (i.e., oncolytic) and (b) elicit an anti-tumor immune response via the adaptive immune system (i.e., immunotherapy).
Locally Advanced and Widely Metastatic Melanoma
 
Our pivotal Phase 3 randomized controlled trial of PV-10 as single-agent treatment for locally advanced cutaneous melanoma (Stage IIIB-IV M1a), compared to standard therapy (i.e., investigator’s choice of oncolytic viral therapy or systemic chemotherapy), opened to enrollment in 2015. The primary outcome measure of the study is progression-free survival assessed every 12 weeks for up to 18 months. Secondary outcome measures include complete response rate and its duration, and overall survival, all also assessed every 12 weeks up to 18 months. In December 2018, we announced a hold on trial enrollment to allow for a more thorough performance comparison analysis of PV-10 combination therapy (i.e., PV-10 and checkpoint inhibition) and historical single-agent PV-10 treatment for these patients. Systemic therapy with checkpoint inhibition is now recommended in the U.S. for Stage III melanoma patients with satellite or in-transit disease.
 
Mechanism of action and other work previously reported by our research collaborators at Moffitt Cancer Center (Toomey et al., PLOS ONE 2013: 8(7); e68561, Liu et al., Oncotarget 2016; 7: 37893, and Pilon-Thomas et al., Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer 2016; 4(Suppl 1): 73) and the University of Illinois at Chicago (Qin et al., Cell Death and Disease 2017; 8: e2584) indicate that PV-10 functions as an oncolytic immunotherapy in laboratory models of multiple tumor types, such as melanoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Both groups of collaborators definitively classify PV-10 as an oncolytic immunotherapy capable of yielding immunogenic cell death, a primer for adaptive immunity, functioning via multiple immune effector cells, including CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer T cells. By the end of 2018, additional mechanism work was underway to assess the potential breadth of this immunotherapy capability.
 
In April 2018, principal investigators at the Princess Alexandra Hospital published results from an investigator-led, single-center study of patients with in-transit melanoma who received intralesional PV-10 under expanded access detailing the experience of treating 45 patients with almost exclusively Stage III disease from 2008 to 2015, including:
 

- | Baseline characteristics: 60% men; median age of 76 years (range 51-90); 96% Stage IIIIB-C; median of 2 prior directed locoregional therapies, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Median of 6 lesions treated with PV-10 (range 1-31); median of 2 treatments with PV-10 (range 1-4), 
- | Per patient best overall response: 42% complete response, 44% partial response, and 7% stable disease, 
- | 22% durable response rate (an objective response lasting more than 6 months from the time of first PV-10 treatment), 
- | Median overall survival of 25 months from the first PV-10 treatment; 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-month overall survival rates of 90%, 85%, 68% and 65%, respectively, from the time of first PV-10 treatment, and 
- | At least one Grade 1 or 2 treatment-associated adverse event per patient; a total of three treatment-associated Grade 3 adverse events (treatment site ulceration, cellulitis, and photosensitivity reaction). 

 
For those patients with more advanced melanoma that is not fully accessible to injection (Stage III-IV), we are assessing PV-10 in combination with checkpoint inhibition in a Phase 1b/2 clinical study. This study is the result of mechanism of action work on PV-10 showing that it may be complementary to checkpoint inhibition. Interim patient-level data from the fully-enrolled Phase 1b study portion of 23 patients were reported at the SMR annual meeting in October 2018, including:
 

- | Baseline characteristics: 83% men; median age of 70 years (range 28-90) and 70% > 65 years; 91% checkpoint naïve, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- | Disease characteristics: 13% Stage IIIC/IIID and 52% Stage IV M1b/M1c; median of 2 cutaneous/subcutaneous lesions (range 1-15); most subjects had substantial non-injected systemic disease burden in addition to their injectable cutaneous and/or subcutaneous lesions, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Treatment summary: Subjects received a median of 4 cycles of PV-10 (mean 3.7, range 1-5) and a median of 5 injections of PV-10 (range 1-82); PV-10 was not administered after week 12, 
- | Preliminary safety: adverse events were consistent with the established patterns for single-agent use of each drug; there were no unexpected toxicities or evidence of significant overlapping toxicity, 
- | Preliminary target lesion efficacy (best overall response): 43% complete response and 65% objective response, 
- | Preliminary overall efficacy (per RECIST 1.1): 9% complete response, 65% objective response, and 70% clinical benefit; 83% objective response in M1c patients. 

 
The interim data were consistent with preliminary data from the Phase 1b study of 12 patients reported at the SMR annual meeting in October 2017, and demonstrated no compounding of safety risk for the combination (the Phase 1b’s primary endpoint) and likely synergy of efficacy (the Phase 1b’s secondary endpoint).
 Preliminary lesion-level data from the fully-enrolled Phase 1b study were reported at Melanoma Bridge in December 2018, including:
 

- | Complete response of injected target lesions for the combination of PV-10 and pembrolizumab was higher than historical complete response for single-agent PV-10 (NCT00521053) across all disease stages: 77% vs 46%, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Complete response of injected target lesions for the combination was higher than CR for single-agent PV-10 for each of these stages: 


o | 73% vs 0% for Stage IV M1a 
--+----------------------------------
o | 71% vs 4% for Stage IV M1b 
o | 100% vs 17% for Stage IV M1c, 


- | Although data on combination treatment of Stage III disease is currently limited, complete response of injected target lesions for the combination was higher than complete response for single-agent PV-10: 67% vs 54%, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | 40% of injected target lesions achieved complete response after one or two injections. 

 
We expanded the Phase 1b study in 2018 to include a first expansion cohort of up to 24 patients with advanced melanoma (Stage III-IV) who are refractory to checkpoint inhibition and a second expansion cohort of up to 24 patients who have satellite or in-transit disease. Both expansion cohorts are currently enrolling patients.
 
Research collaborators at Moffitt Cancer Center published results from a study investigating cancer combination therapy with PV-10 and checkpoint inhibition (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies) in murine melanoma models (Liu et al., PLOS ONE 2018: 13(4); e0196033), and also examined the role of specific immune cell populations in eliciting and controlling tumor-specific response. The authors showed the impact of combining checkpoint inhibition with the tumor-specific immune response induced by PV-10. Treatment with PV-10 and anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in a delay in tumor growth and enhanced T cell activation in an M05 melanoma tumor model. Similar effects were observed with PV-10 and anti-PD-L1 antibody in a B16 tumor model. The effect of combination therapy with PV-10 and PD-1 blockade is mediated by CD8+ T cells, and depletion of either CD4+ T cells or CD4+CD25+ Tregs enhanced anti-tumor immunity in the M05 melanoma model.

Gastrointestinal Cancers
 
During 2018, we continued our exploratory Phase 1 study of cancers of the liver at five regional centers in the U.S. (St. Luke’s University Health Network in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Florida Hospital Tampa in Tampa, Florida, Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego, California, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas). This “basket study” enrolls patients with HCC and other tumor types that have metastasized to the liver. Patients are treated using percutaneous injection of PV-10 under image guidance into a single liver lesion; patients with multiple lesions may receive additional treatment cycles after initial safety follow-up. To date patients with HCC and liver metastases, including colorectal, lung, breast, cutaneous melanoma, uveal melanoma, ovarian, and pancreatic, have been treated at the five centers. The non-clinical mechanism of action work reported by Qin et al. was consistent with clinical observations reported for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer participating in our Phase 1 basket study.
 
In July 2018, we announced that the Phase 1 study had expanded to include a single-site (MD Anderson Cancer Center) cohort of 10 uveal melanoma patients with hepatic metastases. Eligible metastatic uveal melanoma patients may receive either single agent PV-10 or PV-10 in combination with standard of care checkpoint inhibition. Initial data were reported at the SMR annual meeting in October 2018, including:
 

- | A total of four patients received PV-10 to at least one uveal melanoma liver tumor; two patients received a second round of PV-10 treatment to an additional liver tumor; one patient initiated standard of care immunotherapy (YERVOY and OPDIVO) between PV-10 treatments, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Treatment-related adverse events were consistent with established patterns, and 
- | Tumor reduction was observed in 5 of 6 PV-10-injected tumors. 

 
In 2016, we initiated a Phase 1 study to assess PV-10 as an oncolytic immunotherapy for patients with symptomatic metastases of NETs metastatic to the liver. This study was open to enrollment at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide, Australia in 2017 and uses a treatment protocol comparable to that employed in the Phase 1 liver cancer basket study. Because the NET study is focused on a single tumor type, it includes radiologic (medical imaging), blood biomarker, and quality of life assessments specific to NETs. The study was the subject of a trials in progress poster presented at the ESMO annual meeting in October 2018. Six patients in the first cohort each received one injection of PV-10 to one target lesion per treatment cycle. Patients are currently being enrolled into the second cohort that allows for injection of up to three lesions per cycle.
 
Pediatric Cancers
 
In December 2016, we announced a joint research agreement with POETIC to investigate the potential of PV-10 for pediatric cancers. This collaboration involves National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers that are part of the POETIC group such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Alberta Children’s Hospital, and other cancer centers.
 
In June 2018, POETIC researchers presented non-clinical PV-10 data from their pediatric cancer research at ASCO annual meeting. PV-10 induced cell death in pediatric solid tumor cell lines derived from relapsed pediatric neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma with a measurable therapeutic window compared to normal cells. Western blot analyses of cells treated with PV-10 indicated induction of apoptosis. Drug combination studies showed synergy with radiation and agents that target mitosis. Xenograft studies showed significant reduction of tumor burden in PV-10-treated mice compared to control animals, with a corresponding increase in overall survival.

In November 2018, the Company was granted orphan drug designation by FDA for PV-10 for the treatment of neuroblastoma. Initial non-clinical testing of PV-10 in treatment-refractory neuroblastoma has closely paralleled previous non-clinical and clinical study of PV-10 for murine and human adult solid tumors, at both the tumor (selective destruction of injected tumors) and cellular (immunogenic cell death) levels. Non-clinical investigation by POETIC has confirmed that immunogenic cell death also occurs in neuroblastoma. The FDA grants orphan drug designation status to medicines intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US. Orphan drug designation status qualifies companies for benefits that include seven years of market exclusivity following marketing approval, tax credits on U.S. clinical trials, eligibility for orphan drug grants, and waiver of certain administrative fees.
 
Dermatology (PH-10)
 
We are developing PH-10, an aqueous hydrogel formulation of rose bengal disodium, for topical administration to the skin for inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
 
In January 2015, we commenced a mechanism of action study of PH-10 to characterize its immunologic signaling aspects, safety, and efficacy. The clinical portion of this study was completed in January 2016. Advanced immunologic profiling of clinical samples obtained from that work was completed in June 2017 and data were reported at Psoriasis Gene to Clinic in London, England in November 2017. These data demonstrated downregulation of more than 500 disease-related genes, including central “psoriasis-related” genes that were normalized to levels consistent with non-lesional skin, and established that PH-10 has a novel mechanism of action in inflammatory dermatoses.
 
Work has begun in support of extended 12-week administration (proof-of-concept or POC) for PH-10. In 2018, we finished two toxicology-focused, non-clinical, single administration studies using 14C-labeled Rose Bengal to demonstrate lack of systemic uptake. Radio-labeled Rose Bengal is easier to detect in plasma and tissues at very low levels than Rose Bengal itself. These data suggest there is minimal potential of visceral target organ effects from topical application of PH-10. The goal of a planned, non-clinical, toxicology-focused, 12-week administration study would be to demonstrate local effects in the skin from the extended use of PH-10 and identify any potential systemic toxicities. When completed, the 12-week POC program may allow for direct comparison of PH-10 to approved topical treatments for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.
 
Research and Development

Our approach to drug development comprises two related, complementary, clinical program paths based on the features of our respective investigational drugs and their clinically-rational applicability to different patient populations. In solid tumor cancers for adults, for example, we believe PV-10 has important implications as a single-agent for earlier states of disease (e.g., locally advanced disease; Stage III or earlier), while the combination of PV-10 with other classes of therapy (e.g., immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy) is more appropriate for advanced disease states (e.g., widely metastatic disease; Stage IV).

Competition
 
In general, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are competitive, characterized by advances in products and technology. A number of companies have developed and continue to develop products that address the areas we have targeted. Some of these companies are pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that are international in scope and very large in size, while others are small companies that have been successful in one or more areas we are targeting. Existing or future pharmaceutical, device, or other competitors may develop products that accomplish similar functions to our technologies in ways that may be less expensive, receive faster regulatory approval, or receive greater market acceptance than our products. Many of our competitors have been in existence longer than we have, have greater capital resources, broader internal structure for research, development, manufacturing and marketing, and may be further along in their respective product cycles.

Federal Regulation of Therapeutic Products
 
All of the prescription drug candidates we currently contemplate developing will require approval by the FDA prior to sales within the U.S. and by comparable international governmental healthcare regulatory agencies prior to sale outside the U.S. The FDA and comparable international agencies impose substantial requirements on the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety and effectiveness claims, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, and promotion of our prescription drug candidates. While we attempt to minimize and avoid significant regulatory bars when formulating our products, some degree of regulation from these regulatory agencies is unavoidable.
 
The regulatory process required by the FDA, through which our prescription drug candidates must successfully pass before they may be marketed in the U.S., generally involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing, submission of an application that must become effective before clinical trials may begin, adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication, and FDA approval to market a given product for a given indication after the appropriate application has been filed. For pharmaceutical products, pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. Where appropriate (for example, for human disease indications for which there exist inadequate animal models), we will attempt to obtain preliminary data concerning safety and efficacy of prescription drug candidates using carefully designed human pilot studies. We will require sponsored work to be conducted in compliance with pertinent local and international regulatory requirements, including those providing for Institutional Review Board approval, national governing agency approval, and patient informed consent, using protocols consistent with ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and other internationally recognized standards and delineated by the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.
 
If the FDA is satisfied with the results and data from pre-clinical tests, it will authorize human clinical trials. Human clinical trials traditionally are conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap. Each of the three phases involves testing and study of specific aspects of the effects of the investigational product on human subjects, including testing for safety, dosage tolerance, side effects, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and clinical efficacy.
 
Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans, or via a new route of administration or new organ system if previously investigated in humans. These studies are closely monitored and may be conducted in patients but may also be conducted in healthy volunteer subjects. These studies are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. While the FDA can cause us to end clinical trials at any phase due to safety concerns, Phase 1 clinical trials are primarily concerned with safety issues. We also attempt to obtain sufficient information about the drug candidate’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects during Phase 1 clinical trials to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies.
 
Phase 1 studies also evaluate drug metabolism, structure-activity relationships, and the mechanism of action in humans. These studies also determine which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. The total number of subjects included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug but is generally in the range of 10 to 80.

Phase 2 clinical trials include the early controlled clinical studies conducted to obtain some preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition. This phase of testing also helps determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving up to several hundred people.
 
Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained in Phase 2 and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug. Phase 3 studies also provide an adequate basis for extrapolating the results to the general population and transmitting that information in the physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand people.
 
We have established a core clinical development team and have been working with external and FDA-experienced consultants to assist us in developing product-specific development and approval strategies, preparing the required submittals, guiding us through the regulatory process, and providing input into the design and site selection of human clinical studies.
 
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we may not obtain FDA approval on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. The FDA or research institution conducting the trials may suspend clinical trials or may not permit trials to advance from one phase to another at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw a prescription drug approval if we do not comply with pertinent regulatory requirements and standards or if problems are identified after the product reaches the market. If the FDA grants approval of a prescription drug candidate, the approval may impose limitations, including limits on the indicated uses for which we may market a drug product. In addition, the FDA may require additional testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety and/or effectiveness of approved drug products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Further, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug product may result in restrictions on the product, including withdrawal from the market.
 
Marketing our prescription drug candidates abroad will require similar regulatory approvals by equivalent national authorities and is subject to similar risks. To expedite development, we may pursue some or all of our initial clinical testing and approval activities outside the U.S., and in particular in those countries where our prescription drug candidates may have substantial medical and commercial relevance. In some such cases, any resulting drug products may be brought to the U.S. after substantial offshore experience is gained. Accordingly, we intend to pursue any such development in a manner consistent with U.S. and ICH standards so that the resultant development data is maximally applicable for potential global approval.
