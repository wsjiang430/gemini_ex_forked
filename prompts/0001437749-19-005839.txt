Company Overview
 
We are a next generation “low-carbon” fuel company focused on the development and commercialization of renewable alternatives to petroleum-based products. Low-carbon fuels reduce the carbon intensity, or the level of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, compared to standard fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle. The most common low-carbon fuels are renewable fuels. We are focused on the development and production of mainstream fuels like jet fuel and gasoline using renewable feedstocks that have the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions at a meaningful scale and enhance agricultural production, including food and other related products. In addition to serving the low-carbon fuel markets, we can also serve markets for the production of chemical intermediate products for solvents, plastics, and building block chemicals using our technologies.
 
Our proven production technologies target what we believe to be large potential markets of renewable fuels and related chemicals that can compete directly against petrochemical products depending on the price of oil and the value of carbon intensity reductions. Renewable fuels are one of the few fuel products where the value for renewable carbon has already been established, particularly in the United States and the European Union. We believe that the demand for low-carbon fuels and renewable chemicals will continue to grow in the future.
 
Our renewable isobutanol production technology has been proven to work in a 1.5 million gallon per year (“MGPY”) capacity production line, (~265,000 gallon fermenter scale) at our production facility in Luverne, Minnesota (the "Luverne Facility"). We have concluded that the technology works as we expected at this scale. Our technology to convert our renewable isobutanol to ATJ, isooctane, isooctene, and para-xylene (building block for polyester) has been proven at our hydrocarbons demonstration plant located at a hydrocarbons production facility located in Silsbee, Texas (the "Silsbee facility"). We currently have the capacity to produce approximately 100,000 gallons per year of hydrocarbon products at that production facility. 
 
In addition to our isobutanol production line, our Luverne Facility has production capacity of about 20 MGPY of ethanol, 45-50 kilotons of animal feed, and 3 million pounds of corn oil. 
 
Our technology is designed to permit (i) the modification of an existing ethanol production facility whereby equipment is added to the facility and the existing fermenters are used to produce isobutanol rather than ethanol, or (ii) the modification of an existing ethanol facility to add fermenters and other equipment such that the facility is capable of producing both ethanol and isobutanol simultaneously "side-by-side" (collectively referred to as “Retrofit”).
 
Having the flexibility to switch between the production of isobutanol and ethanol, or produce both products simultaneously, should allow us to optimize asset utilization and cash flows at a facility by taking advantage of fluctuations in market conditions. Our technology is also designed to allow relatively low capital expenditure Retrofits of existing ethanol facilities, enabling a relatively rapid route to isobutanol production from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks. Alternatively, our technology can be deployed at a greenfield or brownfield site to produce isobutanol and hydrocarbons without producing ethanol.  
 
Decarbonization
 
We believe that we have the technology and production platform to produce renewable fuels that reduce the emission of additional GHGs into the atmosphere as compared to the burning of fossil-based carbon fuels, and to do so profitably. Low-carbon fuels can best be produced by (i) replacing fossil-based carbon with renewable carbon, and (ii) replacing some or most of the fossil-based energy sources needed for heat and electricity during the fuel production process. Renewable carbon comes from growing plants and crops. Growing plants efficiently provides the opportunity to capture carbon in the soil and generate protein, further lowering the carbon intensity of fuels produced from these renewable feedstocks. Eliminating or reducing fossil-based carbon is referred to as “decarbonization,” and the products resulting from such a decarbonization process are rewarded with a lower carbon intensity score, which increases the market value of certain products. In addition to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) policy that rewards low-carbon fuels, certain markets in North America such as California, Oregon, Washington and Canada and countries such as Japan, China, India, and other Asian countries either already have or are adopting statutes and regulations that ascribe economic value to decarbonization. In Europe, the European Parliament has adopted the Renewable Energy Directive to promote the use of energy from renewable sources. We believe that decarbonization is an emerging market opportunity, and that we have the technologies, products and a base production facility to take advantage of this opportunity.
 
The State of California is a leader in the push for decarbonization with its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”), which is a market-based cap and trade approach to lowering the GHG emissions from petroleum-based transportation fuels. We believe that the LCFS approach to reducing GHGs will be implemented by Canada and other states in the United States and eventually could be implemented at the Federal level, which should create more demand for low-carbon fuel products. The demand and value for low-carbon fuel products in California has sharpened our focus on low carbon intensity ethanol. Our current production facility is small enough and specialized enough so that, with certain process optimizations, we could reduce our demand for fossil-based energy required in the production process. By doing this, we would increase the value of our ethanol because it would carry a lower carbon intensity score, which should translate into increased revenues for us as a result of the credits associated with our renewable fuels under LCFS and/or RFS. Certain improvements we make to produce low-carbon ethanol, are also expected to benefit any other low-carbon products we produce, such as our renewable isobutanol, jet fuel and isooctane (gasoline).
 
Low-Carbon Ethanol Opportunity
 
The Luverne Facility has the capability, with certain capital improvements, to produce low-carbon ethanol side-by-side with low-carbon isobutanol, in addition to renewable jet fuel and isooctane and other related products that can be made from isobutanol. By focusing on low-carbon ethanol in the near term, debottlenecking production, while adapting and optimizing the Luverne Facility’s energy and equipment infrastructure to reduce the reliance on fossil-based energy sources, we believe we can increase revenues. In order to accomplish this, we may undertake further capital investments to improve our Luverne Facility, including but not limited to: (i) improvements at the Luverne Facility to further lower the carbon intensity score of our fuel products; (ii) adding wind power to provide a portion of the electricity needed for biofuel production; (iii) adding renewable natural gas to provide a portion of the natural gas needed for biofuel production; and (iv) installing fractionation technologies at the Luverne Facility to produce value added protein feed products, food grade corn oil, as well as products using the fiber fraction of corn. Concurrently, while focusing on low-carbon ethanol, subject to securing adequate financing, we plan to expand our hydrocarbon production capabilities by constructing a new larger production facility at the Luverne Facility for specialty hydrocarbon fuels (ATJ and isooctane).

The future improvements that we are planning for the Luverne Facility will lower the carbon intensity of the Luverne Facility and should benefit both ethanol and isobutanol production. The smaller size of our Luverne Facility compared to other ethanol production facilities means that the Luverne Facility offers opportunities to lower carbon intensity that other larger scale plants might not possess. For example, we could install small cogeneration units or make certain changes to unit operations to improve water removal efficiency given the lower power demands for steam and electricity which would result in lower ongoing capital expenditures. We believe that smaller, specialized biofuel production facilities aimed at low-carbon specialty fuels, related specialty protein products, and food oils, will have an advantage over large scale ethanol plants that, out of necessity, have to focus on commodity products for industrial markets. In other words, as these low carbon intensity markets further develop, tracking carbon lifecycles will be important. Tracking carbon means knowing the supply of feedstock and how it is grown. We believe a smaller production facility like our Luverne Facility will be well positioned to source sustainably grown feedstocks.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our strategy to grow our business is to become profitable by investing capital to upgrade and “decarbonize” the Luverne Facility to primarily produce low-carbon ethanol for the California market. We plan to use low-carbon ethanol to achieve positive cash flows, which should provide us the time to execute on our ultimate business goal of producing and selling isobutanol and its derivative hydrocarbon products such as ATJ and isooctane. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Undertake process improvements to lower energy consumption and implement lower-carbon process energy options at the Luverne Facility. By investing additional capital to “decarbonize” the Luverne Facility, we believe that we can lower the carbon intensity score (i.e. lower the carbon dioxide emissions from the plant) creating additional profit margin opportunities in low-carbon markets such as California under LCFS and in Europe under the Renewable Energy Directive for our ethanol, as well as for our isobutanol and derivative hydrocarbon products produced from isobutanol. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Implement fractionation technology at the Luverne Facility. We have chosen an innovative corn fractionation technology to deploy at the Luverne Facility in order to generate additional revenue from incremental volumes of alcohol, distiller grains and corn oil, as well as generate new revenue opportunities from the production and sale of corn fiber-based feed products. 
• | Enter into supply agreements for isobutanol and its derivative hydrocarbon products with customers to support capacity growth using project financing or other less expensive and less dilutive forms of capital. We intend to build on our existing customer contracts, such as our isooctane supply agreements with HCS Group GmbH ("HCS"), to obtain additional binding off-take agreements that would economically support converting the Luverne Facility primarily to the production of isobutanol and its derivative hydrocarbon products. If we are able to obtain sufficient new supply agreements, we expect to be able to raise capital to fund such conversion of the Luverne Facility using project financing or other less expensive and less dilutive forms of capital as compared to the equity offerings that we are conducting hereby and have used in the past. 
• | Implement a hydrocarbon production unit in the next two years. Subject to receipt of financing, and pending detailed engineering, we plan to implement a hydrocarbon production unit that would have a capacity up to ten times our current production capacity for renewable hydrocarbons, or 1 MGPY. Doing this would allow us to meet the growing market demand for isooctane and jet fuel more timely and cost effective than a large commercial plant. This 1 MGPY hydrocarbon capability could be built at our existing Luverne facility where we have the capability to produce isobutanol. In addition to adding this 1 MGPY hydrocarbon unit, we expect to install equipment to enable lower production cost for isobutanol and profitably produce the 1 MGPY hydrocarbons. We expect products from this capability would be sold to our existing customer base and enable us to serve new customers and markets. 
• | Subject to receipt of financing, we plan to scale up the Luverne Facility for the production of isobutanol and its derivative products. Upon, and subject to, securing adequate financing agreements and binding supply agreements, we plan to build out the Luverne Facility to enable the production of isobutanol and its derivative products at levels sufficient to supply our initial larger scale off-take agreements with our customers. 
• | Expand the global production capacity of isobutanol and its derivative hydrocarbon products via licensing. We have proven that the isobutanol production process works in full scale fermenter systems at the Luverne Facility, and we have also proven that our renewable isobutanol can be readily converted to hydrocarbon products at the Silsbee Facility. We intend to expand the global production of isobutanol and its derivative hydrocarbon products beyond the Luverne Facility through a low-cost, high-margin licensing model, in collaboration with partners such as Praj Industries, with whom we have previously announced a joint development agreement. 

Markets
 
Ethanol Markets
 
The primary applications for fuel-grade ethanol in the United States include:
 

• | Octane enhancer. On average, regular unleaded gasoline has an octane rating of 87 and premium unleaded gasoline has an octane rating of 91. In contrast, pure ethanol has an average octane rating of 113. Adding ethanol to gasoline enables refiners to produce greater quantities of lower octane blend stock with an octane rating of less than 87 before blending. In addition, ethanol is commonly added to finished regular grade gasoline as a means of producing higher octane mid-grade and premium gasoline.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Fuel blending. In addition to its performance and environmental benefits, ethanol is used to extend fuel supplies. In light of the need for transportation fuel in the United States, the United States is increasingly seeking domestic sources of fuel. Much of the ethanol blending throughout the United States is done for the purpose of extending the volume of fuel sold at the gasoline pump. 
• | Renewable fuels. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to enable gasoline refiners to comply with a variety of governmental programs, in particular, RFS, which was enacted to promote alternatives to fossil fuels. 

 
According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the domestic ethanol industry produced a record 15.8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2017. We believe that the ethanol market in California alone represented approximately 10% of the national market. However, the Western United States has relatively few ethanol facilities and local ethanol production levels are substantially below the local demand for ethanol. The balance of ethanol is shipped via rail from the Midwest to the Western United States.

We believe that approximately 90% of the ethanol produced in the United States is made in the Midwest from corn. According to the Department of Energy, or DOE, ethanol is generally blended at a rate of 10% by volume, but is also blended at a rate of up to 85% by volume for vehicles designed to operate on 85% ethanol. The EPA has increased the allowable blend of ethanol in gasoline from 10% by volume to 15% by volume for model year 2001 and newer automobiles, pending final approvals by certain state regulatory authorities. Some retailers have begun blending at higher rates in states that have approved higher blend rates.
 
             Compared to gasoline, ethanol is generally considered to be cleaner burning and contains higher octane. We anticipate that the increasing demand for renewable transportation fuels coupled with limited opportunities for gasoline refinery expansions and the growing importance of reducing CO2 emissions through the use of renewable fuels will generate additional growth in the demand for ethanol.
 
             According to the DOE, total annual gasoline consumption in the United States is approximately 143 billion gallons and total annual ethanol consumption represented approximately 10% of this amount in 2017. The domestic ethanol industry has substantially reached this 10% blend ratio, and we believe the industry has significant potential for growth in the event the industry can migrate to an up to 15% blend ratio, which would translate into an annual demand of up to 20 billion gallons of ethanol.
 

Isobutanol Direct Use Markets
 
Without modification, isobutanol has applications in the specialty chemical and gasoline blendstock markets. Since our potential customers in these markets would not be required to develop any additional infrastructure to use our isobutanol, we believe that selling into these markets should result in a relatively low risk profile and produce attractive margins.
Gasoline Blendstocks
 

• | Isobutanol has direct applications as a gasoline blendstock. Fuel-grade isobutanol may be used as a high energy content, low Reid Vapor Pressure (“RVP”), gasoline blendstock and oxygenate. Based on isobutanol’s low water solubility, in contrast with ethanol, we believe that isobutanol will be compatible with existing refinery infrastructure, allowing for blending at the refinery rather than blending at the terminal.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Further, based on isobutanol’s high energy content and low water solubility, as well as testing completed by the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute and Briggs & Stratton, we believe that isobutanol has direct applications as a blendstock in high value specialty fuels markets serving marine, off-road vehicles, small engine and sports vehicle markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We estimate the total addressable worldwide market for isobutanol as a gasoline blendstock to be approximately 43 billion gallons per year (“BGPY”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The market size for ethanol free (E0) gasoline, a large niche, is estimated by the EIA to be about 5 BGPY, outside of reformulated gasoline ("RFG") regions. RFG areas are required to sell gasoline containing an oxygenate. Up to this point, ethanol was the only gasoline oxygenate available. We believe our isobutanol enables ethanol free gasoline in RFG areas, a market estimated to be about 2 BGPY. When RFG regions are included in the total US market size estimation, the total ethanol free market is expected to be about 7 BGPY.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specialty Chemicals
 

• | Isobutanol has direct applications as a specialty chemical. High-purity and chemical-grade isobutanol can be used as a solvent and chemical intermediate. We plan to produce high-purity and chemical-grade isobutanol that can be used in the existing butanol markets as a cost-effective, environmentally sensitive alternative to petroleum-based products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe that our production route will be cost-efficient and will allow for significant expansion of the historical isobutanol markets within existing butanol markets through displacing n-butanol, a related compound to isobutanol that is currently sold into butanol markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We estimate the total addressable worldwide market for isobutanol as a specialty chemical to be approximately 1.2 BGPY.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Butene and Hydrocarbon Markets Derived from Isobutanol
 
Beyond direct use as a specialty chemical and gasoline blendstock, isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes which can then be converted into other products such as para-xylene, jet fuel and many other hydrocarbon fuels and specialty blendstocks, and specialty chemicals offering substantial potential for additional demand. The conversion of isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical in multiple markets.
Jet Fuel
 

• | According to the International Air Transport Association (the "IATA"), the year-on-year growth for jet fuel is about 3 BGPY and is expected to continue at approximately the same growth rate for the next decade. From 2020 onward, the airline industry has pledged to hold its annual emission of fossil carbon constant after 2020. By the year 2027, IATA expects that the airline industry will have adopted penalties tied to GHG emissions. This means that the emissions from jets need to be mitigated. As part of the mitigation of fossil based GHGs, IATA expects that renewable resource based low carbon fuels will be needed. We have developed a jet fuel made from our isobutanol, commonly referred to as ATJ.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In April 2016, ASTM International completed its process of approving a revision of ASTM D7566 (Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons) to include alcohol to jet synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from renewable isobutanol. This allows our renewable jet fuel to be used as a blending component in standard Jet A-1 for commercial airline use in the United States and around the globe.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have delivered ATJ, which was used by nine airlines for Fly Green Day, sponsored by the O’Hare Fuel Committee, at Chicago O’Hare International Airport ("Chicago O'Hare"). This event is the first time renewable jet fuel has been supplied at Chicago O’Hare using the existing airport fueling infrastructure, such as pipelines, terminals and tankage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have previously delivered ATJ to Alaska Airlines, which successfully flew multiple commercial flights using our fuel in 2016, including what we believed was the first commercial flight using a cellulosic jet fuel derived from wood waste.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have successfully delivered to the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy a combined total of approximately 90,000 gallons of our ATJ. Military and commercial airlines are currently looking to form strategic alliances with biofuels companies to meet their renewable fuel needs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We estimate the global market for jet fuel to be approximately 89 BGPY.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Hydrocarbon Fuels
 

• | Isooctane, isooctene, diesel fuel and bunker fuel may also be produced from our isobutanol. We have been producing jet fuel and isooctane for renewable gasoline at our demonstration plant located at South Hampton Resources in Silsbee, Texas since 2011. The products produced at our hydrocarbon plant are sold on a commercial basis to develop the markets. We continue to optimize the technologies and production systems, but we believe this technology is ready to scale up on a full commercial basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Para-xylene (“PX”) and Polyethylene Terephthalate (“PET”)
 

• | Isobutanol can be used to produce PX, polyester and their derivatives, which are used in the beverage, food packaging, textile and fibers markets. PX is a key raw material in PET production.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We estimate the global market for PET to be approximately 50 million metric tons per year, of which approximately 30% is used for plastic bottles and containers. We have demonstrated the conversion of our isobutanol into renewable PX at the demonstration plant in Silsbee, Texas. This demonstration plant produced renewable PX from October 2013 through March 2014, and, in May 2014, we shipped renewable PX to Toray Industries, Inc. under the terms of a supply agreement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Butenes
 

• | Traditionally butenes have been produced as co-products from the process of cracking naphtha in the production of ethylene. Historically, lower natural gas prices and reported reductions in the use of naphtha as the feedstock for the production of ethylene have resulted in a projected reduction in the volume of available butenes. This structural shift in feedstocks increases the potential market opportunity for our isobutanol in the production of butenes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Isobutanol can be sold to isobutylene and n-butene (butenes) chemicals users for conversion into lubricants, methyl methacrylate and rubber applications.
 
Distillers Grains Market
 
Distillers grains are produced as a co-product of ethanol production and isobutanol production.  Distillers grains are valuable components of feed rations primarily to dairies and beef cattle markets, both nationally and internationally. The Luverne Facility has the capability to produce distillers grains from both ethanol and isobutanol.  Producing distillers grains also allows us to lower the carbon footprint of our Luverne Facility, thereby increasing demand in California where premiums are paid for the low-carbon attributes.
 
Historically, the market price for distillers grains has generally tracked the value of corn. We believe that the market price of distillers grains is determined by a number of factors, including the market value of corn, soybean meal and other competitive ingredients, the performance or value of the distillers grains in a particular feed formulation and general market forces of supply and demand, including export markets for these co-products. The market price of distillers grains is also often influenced by nutritional models that calculate the feed value of distillers grains by nutritional content, as well as reliability of consistent supply.

Our Retrofit at the Luverne Facility
 
In September 2010, we acquired the Luverne Facility, a 22 MGPY ethanol production facility in Luverne, Minnesota. Since 2010, we made improvements and modifications to the Luverne Facility to add isobutanol production capabilities. The Luverne Facility is currently configured to produce ethanol and isobutanol, side-by-side.
Third Party Retrofit and Construction Activities
 
We have commenced a licensing strategy whereby a licensee would invest the capital for the Retrofit of its own ethanol plant or for a new greenfield build out of an isobutanol-producing plant. In return, we, as the licensor, would expect to receive an up-front license fee and ongoing royalty payments from the projects, as well as other potential revenue streams such as yeast sales. This licensing strategy is expected to take some time to develop, and we cannot assure that it will be successful. The ability to license a technology is generally related to the commercial track record of the underlying technology itself. In addition, revenues from licensing our isobutanol and/or hydrocarbon technologies are expected to be directly linked to the build out of specific projects, which may take multiple years to construct.
Our Production Technology Platform
 
We have used tools from synthetic biology, biotechnology, chemical catalysis, and process engineering to develop a proprietary set of technologies that enable the potential of cost effective production of isobutanol and hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals. We believe the technologies to be proven to work, having made and sold products using these technologies.  
 
We have a proprietary fermentation yeast biocatalyst that effectively produces isobutanol. The advantage of this biocatalyst is that it (i) works in large scale fermentation systems, and (ii) can operate in complex biological mixtures such as corn mash or molasses and produce a suitable clean isobutanol product.  The technology is designed to use similar carbohydrate feedstocks, similar to ethanol technology. For example, carbohydrates from non-food corn, sugar cane, molasses or cellulosic sugars each could be used depending upon cost and availability.  We believe that our technology has the potential to add value to existing ethanol production sites by increasing the site profitability if our technologies are deployed.  
 
We have demonstrated that our isobutanol to hydrocarbon technologies for the production of jet fuel, isooctane, isooctene, and paraxylene appear to be viable from a technical and process point of view.  These catalytic technologies appear to be effective and scalable.  
 
Animal feed, protein, and oil are important products produced at our Luverne Facility.  Animal feed is made from the spent grain mash from isobutanol and ethanol fermentations. We market our distiller’s grains to the, beef, swine and poultry industries as a high-protein, high-energy animal feed. The spent yeast from fermentation adds protein to the mix, resulting in a higher protein content than corn itself. By selling the feed, protein, and oil products, we generate additional revenues and effectively reduce the net cost of fermentation feedstock.  Going forward we see opportunity to further add value to animal feed, protein, and oil products, thereby benefiting the site margin at the Luverne Facility, whether we produce isobutanol, ethanol, or both.

Biocatalyst Overview
 
Our biocatalysts are microorganisms that have been designed to consume carbohydrates and produce isobutanol as a product. Our technology team developed these proprietary biocatalysts to efficiently convert fermentable sugars of all types into isobutanol by engineering isobutanol pathways into the biocatalysts.  We designed our biocatalysts to equal or exceed the performance of the yeast currently used in commercial ethanol production in yield (percentage of the theoretical maximum percentage of isobutanol that can be made from a given amount of feedstock) and rate (how fast the sugar fed to the fermentation is converted to isobutanol). To achieve this, we believe that more than 100 genetic changes have been made to our yeast biocatalyst.  We achieved our target fermentation performance goals at our Luverne Facility at a commercial scale. We continue to seek to improve the performance parameters of our biocatalyst with a goal of reducing projected capital and operating costs, increasing operating reliability and increasing the volume of isobutanol production.
 
In 2016, in a project sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture, we used our 1 MGPY demonstration facility located at ICM, Inc.’s St. Joseph, Missouri facility to convert hydrolyzed wood feedstocks into isobutanol. The isobutanol produced was converted to jet fuel and used for flights on Alaska Airlines.  
 
While we believe that the majority of the development work on a commercially viable isobutanol producing yeast is complete, we expect to continue to make incremental improvements targeted to its commercial performance.
 
Feedstocks
 
In the U.S., non-food corn is a commercially attractive feedstock for both ethanol and isobutanol, because it is abundant and readily available, but more importantly because this corn generates low cost carbohydrates, protein and feed and corn oil for the food chain.  In other parts of the world, sugar or molasses from cane, beets, or other sugar producing crops could be used.  In the future, certain types of cellulosic sugars could be used once the cost to acquire those sugars becomes cost effective. We have designed our biocatalyst platform to be capable of producing isobutanol from any fuel ethanol feedstock currently in commercial use, which we believe, in conjunction with our proprietary isobutanol separation unit, will permit us to modify any existing fuel ethanol facility to produce our products.
 
Our Luverne Facility is currently set up to use non-food corn as a feedstock. The starch is fermented to isobutanol and or ethanol, the fiber and protein are isolated from the process and sold as animal feed, and the corn oil is sold for industrial use.  
 
We expect that our feedstock flexibility will allow our technology to be deployed worldwide and will enable us to offer our customers protection from the raw material cost volatility historically associated with petroleum-based products. For example, in some parts of the world, it may be that molasses is a lower cost feedstock, in others, sugar from beets or cane might be the lower cost feedstock. As cellulosic sugars become economical, we expect that these could be viable as a feedstock too.
 
In the future we expect feedstocks to be chosen on the collective basis of (i) cost, (ii) carbon and or sustainability footprint with associated value, (iii) positive contribution to food chain where possible, and (iv) availability of the feedstock at a practical scale.
 
In June 2015, Agri-Energy, LLC ("Agri-Energy"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Price Risk Management, Origination and Merchandising Agreement, as amended as of December 21, 2017 (the “Origination Agreement”), with FCStone Merchant Services, LLC (“FCStone”) and a Grain Bin Lease Agreement with FCStone, as amended as of December 21, 2107 (the “Lease Agreement”). Pursuant to the Origination Agreement, FCStone will originate and sell to Agri-Energy, the owner of the Luverne Facility, and Agri-Energy will purchase from FCStone, the entire volume of corn grain used by the Luverne Facility in Luverne, Minnesota.
 
Conversion of Isobutanol into Hydrocarbons
 
We have demonstrated conversion of our isobutanol into a wide variety of hydrocarbon products that are currently used to produce plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers and hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrocarbon products consist entirely of hydrogen and carbon and are currently derived almost exclusively from petroleum, natural gas and coal. Importantly, isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes, which are an intermediate product in the production of hydrocarbon products with many industrial uses. The straightforward conversion of our isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical. Much of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into butenes and subsequently into these hydrocarbon products is commonly known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. For example, the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, which uses a similar process and technology to the dehydration of isobutanol, is practiced commercially today to serve the ethylene market. The dehydration of isobutanol into butenes is not commercially practiced today because isobutanol produced from petroleum is not cost-competitive with other petrochemical processes for generation of butenes. We believe that our efficient fermentation technology for producing isobutanol will promote commercial isobutanol dehydration and provide us with the opportunity to access hydrocarbon markets. To assist in accessing these markets, we have developed a hydrocarbon processing demonstration plant (“Hydrocarbons Demo Plant”) near Houston, Texas, in partnership with South Hampton Resources, Inc. (“South Hampton”). The Hydrocarbon Demo Plant can process approximately 6,000 to 8,000 gallons of our isobutanol per month into a variety of renewable hydrocarbons for use as fuels and chemicals. We have been selling products from this plant since 2011.

Our ETO Technology
 
We have also developed new technologies using ethanol as a feedstock for the production of hydrocarbons, renewable hydrogen, and other chemical intermediates, which we describe as our ethanol-to-olefins (“ETO”) technologies. The process produces tailored mixes of isobutylene, propylene, hydrogen and acetone, which are valuable as standalone molecules, or as feedstocks to produce other chemical products and longer chain alcohols. This technology has the potential to address additional markets in the chemicals and plastics fields, such as renewable polypropylene for automobiles and packaging and renewable hydrogen for use in chemical and fuel cell markets. At this time, this technology has only been operated at a laboratory scale, but if successfully scaled up to commercial level, this technology may provide the estimated 25 BGPY global ethanol industry a broader set of end-product market and margin opportunities.
 
Underpinning the ETO technology is our development of proprietary mixed metal oxide catalysts that produce either propylene, isobutylene or acetone in high yields in a single processing step. One of the benefits of the technology is that we can use conventional fuel grade specification ethanol that can be sourced from a variety of feedstocks with no apparent adverse impact on end product yields. Water, which is co-fed with the ethanol, is able to be recycled resulting in a process which generates minimal waste. The ethanol and water mixture is vaporized and fed across a fixed catalyst bed resulting in a gaseous product mix consisting of the propylene, isobutylene or acetone, in addition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, along with lesser amounts of methane and ethylene. Separation of gaseous products can be achieved via conventional process technologies and unit operations within the petroleum industry.
 
We have found that our ETO technology is effective at converting fusel oils into flavors, fragrances, and certain specialty chemicals. We are evaluating the business opportunities and commercial potential.
 
Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC
 
Between 2011 and 2015, we were involved in an intellectual property dispute with Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC (“Butamax”). We believe the dispute was satisfactorily resolved, enabling each of our companies to pursue their respective businesses.
Cross License Agreement
 
On August 22, 2015, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Butamax, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (“DuPont”) and BP Biofuels North America LLC (“BP” and, together with Butamax and DuPont, the “Butamax Parties”), that resolves the various disputes, lawsuits and other proceedings between one or more of the Butamax Parties and us, as previously disclosed and as specifically identified in the Settlement Agreement (the “Subject Litigation”), and creates a new business relationship pursuant to which we and Butamax and we have granted rights to each other under certain patents and patent applications in accordance with the terms of a Patent Cross-License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), which was entered into by us and Butamax concurrently with the Settlement Agreement. For additional information concerning the settlement agreement, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2015 — Item 3 Legal Proceedings.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, each party receives a non-exclusive license under certain patents and patent applications owned or licensed (and sublicensable) by the other party for the production and use of biocatalysts in the manufacture of isobutanol using certain production process technology for the separation of isobutanol, and to manufacture and sell such isobutanol in any fields relating to the production or use of isobutanol and isobutanol derivatives, subject to the customer-facing field restrictions described below. Each party also receives a non-exclusive license to perform research and development on biocatalysts for the production, recovery and use of isobutanol.
 
Each party may produce and sell up to 30 MGPY of isobutanol in any field on a royalty-free basis. Butamax will be the primary customer-facing seller of isobutanol in the field of fuel blending (subject to certain exceptions, the “Direct Fuel Blending” field) and we will be the primary customer-facing seller of isobutanol in the field of jet fuel for use in aviation gas turbines (the “Jet” field, also subject to certain exceptions). As such, subject to each party’s right to sell up to 30 MGPYof isobutanol in any field on a royalty-free basis, other than with Butamax’s written consent, we will only sell isobutanol through Butamax in the Direct Fuel Blending field subject to a royalty based on the net sales price for each gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by us, our affiliates or sublicensees within the Direct Fuel Blending field (whether through Butamax or not) and on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties and Butamax will only sell isobutanol through us in the Jet field subject to a royalty based on the net sales price for each gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by Butamax, its affiliates or sublicensees within the Jet field (whether through us or not) and on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties; provided, that each party may sell up to 15 MGPY of isobutanol in a given year directly to customers in the other party’s customer-facing field on a royalty-free basis so long as the isobutanol volumes are within the permitted 30 MGPY of isobutanol sold or otherwise transferred per year in any field described above and, in certain instances, each party may then sell up to the total permitted 30 MGPY in the other party’s customer-facing field on a royalty-free basis. In addition, in order to maintain its status as the primary customer-facing seller in these specific fields, each party must meet certain milestones within the first five years of the License Agreement. If such milestones are not met as determined by an arbitration panel, then a party will have the right to sell directly to customers in the other party’s customer-facing field subject to the payment of certain royalties to the other party on such sales.
 
 10


In addition to the royalties discussed above for sales of isobutanol in the Direct Fuel Blending field, and subject to our right to sell up to 30 MGPY of isobutanol in any field on a royalty-free basis, we will pay to Butamax a royalty per gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by us, our affiliates or sublicensees within the field of isobutylene (a derivative of isobutanol) applications (other than isobutylene for paraxylene, isooctane, Jet, diesel and oligomerized isobutylene applications). Likewise, in addition to the royalties discussed above for sales of isobutanol in the Jet field, and subject to Butamax’s right to sell up to 30 MGPY of isobutanol in any field on a royalty-free basis, Butamax will pay to us a royalty per gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by Butamax, its affiliates or sublicensees within the fields of marine gasoline, retail packaged fuels and paraxylene (except for gasoline blending that results in use in marine or other fuel applications). The royalties described above will be due only once for any volume of isobutanol sold or transferred under the License Agreement, and such royalties accrue when such volume of isobutanol is distributed for end use in the particular royalty-bearing field. All sales of isobutanol in other fields will be royalty-free, subject to the potential technology fee described below.
 ﻿
 In the event that we, our affiliates or sublicensees choose to employ a certain solids separation technology for the production of isobutanol at one of their respective plants (“Solids Separation Technology”), we are granted an option to license such technology from Butamax on a non-exclusive basis subject to the payment of a one-time technology license fee based on the rated isobutanol capacity for each such plant (subject to additional fees upon expansion of such capacity). We also receive the option to obtain an engineering package from Butamax to implement the Solids Separation Technology on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties and subject to the technology fee described above and an additional technology licensing fee for use of the Solids Separation Technology applicable to ethanol capacity as provided in such engineering package from Butamax (which capacity is not duplicative of the rated isobutanol capacity referenced above) in instances where Butamax provides an engineering package for use at a particular plant that will run isobutanol and ethanol production side-by-side using the licensed Solids Separation Technology at such plant.
 
The License Agreement encompasses both parties’ patents for producing isobutanol, including biocatalysts and separation technologies, as well as for producing hydrocarbon products derived from isobutanol, including certain improvements and new patent applications filed within seven years of the date of the License Agreement. While the parties have cross-licensed their patents for making and using isobutanol, the parties will not share their own proprietary biocatalysts with each other. The parties may use third parties to manufacture biocatalysts on their behalf and may license their respective technology packages for the production of isobutanol to third parties, subject to certain restrictions. A third party licensee would be granted a sub-license, and would be subject to terms and conditions that are consistent with those under the License Agreement.
 
Under the License Agreement, the parties also agreed to certain limitations on the making or participating in a challenge of the other party’s patents that are at issue in the Subject Litigation. The parties have also made certain representations, warranties and covenants to each other including, without limitation, with respect to obtaining certain consents, indebtedness, rights in the licensed patents, and relationships with certain other ethanol plant process technology providers.
 
The License Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated by a party as provided in the License Agreement. The parties also have certain termination rights with respect to the term of the license granted to the other party under the License Agreement upon the occurrence of, among other things, a material uncured breach by the other party. In the event that a party’s license is terminated under the License Agreement, such party’s sublicense agreements may be assigned to the other party, subject to certain restrictions.
 
The parties may not assign the License Agreement or any right or obligation thereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. However, the parties may assign the License Agreement to an affiliate or a person that acquires all of the business or assets of such party, subject to certain restrictions.
 
Competition
 
Our isobutanol is targeted for use in the following markets: direct use as a solvent and gasoline blendstock, use in the chemicals industry for producing rubber, plastics, fibers, polyester and other polymers and use in the production of hydrocarbon fuels. We face competitors in each market, some of which are limited to individual markets, and some of which will compete with us across all of our target markets. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do. If we fail to raise sufficient capital for our business and strategy, we may not be able to successfully compete.
 
 11


Renewable isobutanol. We are a leader in the development of renewable isobutanol via fermentation of renewable plant biomass. While the competitive landscape in renewable isobutanol production is limited at this time, we are aware of other companies that are seeking to develop isobutanol production capabilities, including Butamax with whom we have entered into the License Agreement. See —"Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC—Cross License Agreement".
 
Solvent markets. We also face competition from companies that are focused on the development of n-butanol, a related compound to isobutanol. These companies include Cathay Industrial Biotech Ltd., METabolic EXplorer S.A., Eastman Chemicals Company, and Green Biologics Ltd. We understand that these companies produce n-butanol from an acetone-butanol-ethanol (“ABE”) fermentation process primarily for the small chemicals markets. ABE fermentation using a Clostridia biocatalyst has been used in industrial settings since 1919. As discussed in several academic papers analyzing the ABE process, such fermentation is handicapped in competitiveness by high energy costs due to low concentrations of butanol produced and significant volumes of water processed. It requires high capital and operating costs to support industrial scale production due to the low rates of the Clostridia fermentation, and results in a lower butanol yield because it produces ethanol and acetone as by-products. We believe our proprietary process has many significant advantages over the ABE process because of its limited requirements for new capital expenditures, its production output of only isobutanol as a primary product and its limited water usage in production. We believe these advantages will produce a lower cost isobutanol compared to n-butanol produced by ABE fermentation. N-butanol’s lower octane rating compared to isobutanol gives it a lower value in the gasoline blendstock market, but n-butanol can compete directly in many solvent markets where n-butanol and isobutanol have similar performance characteristics.
 
Gasoline blendstocks. In the gasoline blendstock market, isobutanol competes with non-renewable alkylate and renewable ethanol. We estimate the total potential global market for isobutanol as a gasoline blendstock to be approximately 43 BGPY. Alkylate is a premium value gasoline blendstock typically derived from petroleum. However, petroleum feeds for alkylate manufacture are pressured by continued increases in the use of natural gas to generate olefins for the production of alkylate, due to the low relative cost of natural gas compared to petroleum. Isobutanol has fuel properties similar to alkylate and, as such, we expect that isobutanol could be used as a substitute for some alkylate in fuel applications. Ethanol is renewable and has a high octane rating, and although it has a high RVP, ethanol receives a one pound RVP waiver in a large portion of the U.S. gasoline market. Renewability is important in the U.S. because the Renewable Fuels Standard program mandates that a minimum volume of renewable blendstocks be used in gasoline each year. A high octane rating is important for engine performance and is a valuable characteristic because many inexpensive gasoline blendstocks have lower octane ratings. Low RVP is important because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) sets maximum permissible RVP levels for gasoline. In markets where low RVP is important, isobutanol can enable refiners to meet fuel specifications at lower cost. Ethanol’s vapor pressure waiver is valuable because it offsets much of the negative value of ethanol’s high RVP. We believe that our isobutanol will be valued for its combination of low RVP, low water solubility, relatively high octane and renewability.
 
Many production and technology supply companies are working to develop ethanol production from cellulosic feedstocks, including Shell Oil Company, DuPont-Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol LLC, POET, LLC, ICM, Inc., Mascoma Corporation, Inbicon A/S, INEOS New Planet BioEnergy LLC, Archer Daniels Midland Company, BlueFire Renewables, Inc., ZeaChem Inc., Iogen Corporation, Qteros, Inc., and many smaller startup companies. Successful commercialization by some or all of these companies will increase the supply of renewable gasoline blendstocks worldwide, potentially reducing the market size or margins available to isobutanol.
 
Of particular interest to us is the “ethanol free” gasoline blendstock market. This market segment is estimated by the EIA to be approximately 5 BGPY in non RFG regions.  In the past, ethanol free gasoline could not be sold in RFG areas because RFG areas require oxygen in gasoline.  Isobutanol can now be used in the RFG areas to make an ethanol free gasoline.  The estimated potential of isobutanol blended gasoline is estimated to be about 2 BGPY.  Isobutanol containing gasoline has been successfully introduced in the Houston region. It appears that isobutanol is uniquely suited to address the market for ethanol free gasoline in RFG areas.  We are unaware of any other viable alternative.
 
Plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers. Isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes, hydrocarbon intermediates currently used in the production of plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers. The straightforward conversion of our isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical in multiple markets. These markets include butyl rubber, lubricants and additives derived from butenes such as isobutylene, poly methyl methacrylate from isobutanol, propylene for polypropylene from isobutylene, polyesters made via PX from isobutylene and polystyrene made via styrene.
 
In these markets, we compete with the renewable isobutanol companies and renewable n-butanol producers described previously, and face similar competitive challenges. Our competitive position versus petroleum-derived plastics, fibers, rubber and other polymers varies, but we believe that the high volatility of petroleum prices, often tight supply markets for petroleum-based petrochemical feedstocks and the desire of many consumers for goods made from more renewable sources will enable us to compete effectively. However, petrochemical companies may develop alternative pathways to produce petrochemical-based hydrocarbon products that may be less expensive than our isobutanol or more readily available or developed in conjunction with major petrochemical, refiner or end user companies. These products may have economic or other advantages over the plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers developed from our isobutanol. Further, some of these companies have access to significantly more resources than we do to develop products.
 
 12


Additionally, Global Bioenergies, S.A. is pursuing the direct production of isobutylene from renewable carbohydrates. Through analysis of the fermentation pathway, we believe that the direct production of butenes such as isobutylene via fermentation will have higher capital and operating costs than production of butenes derived from our isobutanol.
 
Hydrocarbon fuels. Beyond direct use as a fuel additive, isobutanol can be converted into many hydrocarbon fuels and specialty blendstocks, offering substantial potential for additional demand in the fuels markets. We will compete with the incumbent petroleum-based fuels industry, as well as biofuels companies. The incumbent petroleum-based fuels industry makes the vast majority of the world’s gasoline, jet and diesel fuels and blendstocks. The petroleum-based fuels industry is mature, and includes a substantial base of infrastructure for the production and distribution of petroleum-derived products. However, the industry faces challenges from its dependence on petroleum. High and volatile oil prices will provide an opportunity for renewable producers relying on biobased feedstocks like corn, which in recent years have had lower price volatility than oil, to compete.
 
Biofuels companies will provide substantial competition in the gasoline market. These biofuels competitors are numerous and include both large established companies and numerous startups. Government tax incentives for renewable fuel producers and regulations such as the RFS Program help provide opportunities for renewable fuels producers to compete. In particular, in the gasoline and gasoline blendstock markets, Virent Energy Systems, Inc. (“Virent”) offers a competitive process for making gasoline and gasoline blendstocks. However, we have the advantage of being able to target conversion of isobutanol into specific high-value molecules such as isooctane, which can be used to make gasoline blendstocks with a higher value than whole gasoline, which we do not believe Virent’s process can match. In the jet fuel market, we may face competition from companies such as Synthetic Genomics, Inc., Sapphire Energy, Inc. and Exxon-Mobil Corporation, which are pursuing production of jet fuel from algae-based technology. Renewable Energy Group, Inc. and others are also targeting production of jet fuels from vegetable oils and animal fats. Red Rock Biofuels LLC, Fulcrum BioEnergy, Inc. and others are planning to produce jet fuel from renewable biomass.  In the diesel fuels market, competitors such as Amyris Biotechnologies, Inc. (“Amyris”) provide alternative hydrocarbon diesel fuel. We believe our technology provides a higher yield on feedstock than the isoprenoid fermentation pathway developed by Amyris, which we believe will yield a production cost advantage.
 
Ethanol. We compete with numerous ethanol producers located throughout the U.S., many of which have much greater resources than we do, including Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Green Plains, Inc., POET, LLC and Valero Energy Corporation. Competition for corn supply from other ethanol plants and other corn consumers will likely exist in all areas and regions in which our current and future plants will operate. We also face competition from foreign producers of ethanol and such competition may increase significantly in the future. Large international companies have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities. Brazil is the world’s second largest ethanol producing country. Brazil’s ethanol production is sugarcane-based, as opposed to corn-based, and has historically been less expensive to produce.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary products and technology for which we seek protection under patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Such protection is also maintained in part using confidential disclosure agreements. Protection of our technologies is important so that we may offer our customers and partners proprietary services and products unavailable from our competitors, and so that we may exclude our competitors from using technology that we have developed or exclusively licensed. If competitors in our industry have access to the same technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected.
 
We have submitted hundreds of patent applications in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. These patent applications are directed to our technologies and specific methods and products that support our business in the biofuel and bioindustrial markets. We continue to file new patent applications, for which terms extend up to 20 years from the filing date in the U.S.
 
We have been issued multiple patents in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.
 
In addition to the patents and applications described above, we have a global cross-license to certain patents and applications relating to the production, recovery, and use of isobutanol that are owned or licensed by Butamax. The global cross-license allows us to freely practice the licensed inventions, subject to the terms of the cross-license. For information regarding this license, see —"Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC—Cross License Agreement".
 
 13


We intend to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain trade secrets, as is consistent with our business plan, in an ongoing effort to protect our intellectual property. It is possible that our licensors’ current patents, or patents which we may later acquire or license, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our filed applications, and may not be able to obtain patents regarding other inventions we seek to protect. We also may not file patents in each country in which we plan to do business or actually conduct business. Under appropriate circumstances, we may sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we may subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we will develop products or technologies that will not be patentable or that the patents of others will limit or preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity.
 
We have obtained registered trademarks for Gevo Integrated Fermentation TechnologyTM, GIFTTM, and Gevo® in the U.S. These registered and pending U.S. trademarks are also registered or pending in certain foreign countries.
 
Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to or compete with ours. Patent, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology platform and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to operate using aspects of our intellectual property or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable. In addition, if any of our products or technologies is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future.
 
Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation or other allegations. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. We may be unable to finance litigation costs, which may harm our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to make, use or sell the products or technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology.
 
Customers, Partnerships and Collaborations
 
In 2018, Eco-Energy, LLC ("Eco-Energy") accounted for approximately 72% of our consolidated revenue. In 2017 and 2016, C&N Ethanol Marketing, LLC (C&N Ethanol") accounted for approximately 76%, 71% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. In the same years, Purina Animal Nutrition, LLC, formerly Land O'Lakes Purina Feed LLC ("Purina") accounted for approximately 21%, 17% and 17% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Both are customers of our Gevo Development/Agri-Energy segment (see Note 18). Given the production capacity compared to the overall size of the North American market and the fungible demand for our products, we do not believe that a decline in a specific customer's purchases would have a material adverse long-term effect upon our financial results.
 
As of the date of the filing of this Report, we had entered into the following key arrangements:
 

● | HCS Group GmbH – In February 2019, we entered into a long-term, “take or pay” renewable isooctane purchase and sale agreement with HCS to supply renewable isooctane. We believe that this long-term, “take or pay” purchase and sale agreement with HCS is an important step forward in our previously-announced strategy to build out our advanced biofuels production facility in Luverne, Minnesota to increase the production of isobutanol and renewable jet fuel and isooctane derived from renewable isobutanol.

● | Eco-Energy. In February 2018, we entered into an ethanol and isobutanol purchase and marketing agreement with Eco-Energy, which provides for the sale and marketing of ethanol and isobutanol produced at our Luverne Facility. Eco-Energy will purchase at least 90% of our ethanol production for its own use or account, or purchase such amounts of ethanol to sell and market to third parties, at market prices at the time of a purchase order for the sale of the ethanol. Agri-Energy will also pay Eco-Energy a marketing fee for any product sold to third parties under the terms of the agreement. Agri-Energy may also sell isobutanol to Eco-Energy under the terms of the agreement, however, Agri-Energy is under no obligation to sell any isobutanol to Eco-Energy.

● | Purina Animal Nutrition, LLC. In December 2011, we entered into a commercial iDG's™ off-take and marketing agreement with Purina for the sale of iDGs™ produced by the Luverne Facility. Purina provides farmers and ranchers with an extensive line of agricultural supplies (feed, seed, and crop protection products) and services. In February 2019, we amended and restated the agreement with Purina. Pursuant to the amended and restated agreement, Purina will be the exclusive marketer of all of our animal feed products. The amended and restated agreement has an initial three-year term with one-year renewals thereafter if the parties so agree. Further, we plan to work with Purina to explore opportunities to upgrade our animal feed products for special value-added applications in feed markets.

Research and Development
 
Our strategy depends on continued improvement of our technologies for the production of isobutanol, as well as next generation chemicals and biofuels based on our isobutanol technology. Accordingly, we annually devote significant funds to research and development. Our research and development activities are currently being performed primarily in our corporate headquarters located in Englewood, Colorado and the Hydrocarbons Demo Plant in Silsbee, Texas.
Government Regulation - Environmental Compliance Costs
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of second-generation biofuels. Our isobutanol and the next generation products isobutanol will be used to produce may require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, biofuels are subject to rigorous testing and premarket approval requirements by the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, storage and use of biofuels. The process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of the next generation products isobutanol is used to produce, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the uses for which our isobutanol and these next generation products may be marketed.
 
When built at a dry-mill facility, our GIFT™ fermentation process creates iDGs™, a potential animal feed component, as a co-product. We are currently approved to sell iDGs™ as animal feed through the self-assessed Generally Regarded as Safe (“GRAS”) process of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) via third party scientific review. While we believe we can rely on the GRAS process, as we update our biocatalysts to increase isobutanol production, for further customer assurance, we also intend to pursue approval upon a completed biocatalyst from the Center for Veterinary Medicine of the FDA. Even if we receive such approval, the FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, delay or require regulatory approval of our co-products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulations that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
Our process contains a genetically engineered organism which, when used in an industrial process, is considered a new chemical under the EPA’s Toxic Substances Control Act program (“TSCA”). The EPA’s Biotechnology Program under TSCA requires the submission of certain information of the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxic Substances. Due to the nature of our microorganism we can utilize the TSCA Biotechnology Program Tier I and Tier II exemption criteria at our Luverne Facility..  As we expand our business activities, we will pursue the EPA’s Microbial Commercial Activity Notice process for future plants. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements. However, the TSCA new chemical submission policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulations that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
There are various third-party certification organizations, such as ASTM International and Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”), involved in certifying the transportation, dispensing and use of liquid fuel in the U.S. and internationally. In 2013, a specification for fuel grade isobutanol titled ASTM D7862 “Standard Specification for Butanol for Blending with Gasoline for Use as Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel” was published. In April 2016, ASTM International completed its process of approving the revision of ASTM D7566 (Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons) to include alcohol to jet synthetic paraffinic kerosene (ATJ-SPK) derived from renewable isobutanol. In addition, UL has published guidance on the use of isobutanol-gasoline blends in its UL87A fuel dispensers. When ATJ-SPK which meets the specifications of ASTM D7566 is blended at a level of 30% or lower with petroleum based jet fuel which meets the specifications of ASTM D1655, the entire blended product meets the specifications of ASTM D1655, conventional jet fuel. In other words, the blend containing the ATJ-SPK is completely fungible with any conventional D1655 jet fuel. Voluntary standards development organizations may change and additional requirements may be enacted that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our products. The process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial conditions as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements, but we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse third-party requirements that might arise from future action, either in the U.S. or abroad.

We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations require us to obtain environmental permits and comply with numerous environmental restrictions as we construct and operate isobutanol assets. They may require expensive pollution control equipment or operation changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns.
 
There is a risk of liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances. If these substances are or have been disposed of or released at sites that undergo investigation or remediation by regulatory agencies, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of investigation and remediation. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from the properties. Some of these matters may require us to expend significant amounts for investigation and cleanup or other costs. We are not aware of any material environmental liabilities relating to contamination at or from our facilities or at off-site locations where we have transported or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances.
 
In addition, new laws, new interpretations of existing laws, increased governmental enforcement of environmental laws or other developments could require us to make significant additional expenditures. Continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues can be expected to result in increased future investments in environmental controls at our facilities which cannot be estimated at this time. Present and future environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, more vigorous enforcement policies and discovery of currently unknown conditions could all require us to make substantial expenditures. For example, our air emissions are subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and similar state and local laws and associated regulations. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has promulgated National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”), which could apply to facilities that we own or operate if the emissions of hazardous air pollutants exceed certain thresholds. If a facility we operate is authorized to emit hazardous air pollutants above the threshold level, then we might still be required to come into compliance with another NESHAP at some future time. New or expanded facilities might be required to comply with both standards upon startup if they exceed the hazardous air pollutant threshold. In addition to costs for achieving and maintaining compliance with these laws, more stringent standards may also limit our operating flexibility.
 
As a condition to granting the permits necessary for operating our facilities, regulators could make demands that increase our construction and operations costs, which might force us to obtain additional financing. For example, unanticipated water discharge limits could sharply increase construction costs for our projects. Permit conditions could also restrict or limit the extent of our operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or comply with the terms of all necessary permits to complete the Retrofit of an ethanol plant. Failure to obtain and comply with all applicable permits and licenses could halt our construction and could subject us to future claims.
 
Our products benefit from the RFS Program in that our ethanol and isobutanol are currently eligible for Renewable Identification Numbers or RINS that have value based on the current RFS Program. The RFS Program could change, impacting our products, positively or negatively.
 
Various systems are being put in place around the workd to measure carbon intensity and reduction of GHGs, with the intent of creating a system to monetize the value of the reduction of carbon. LCFS in CA is a good example. In order to benefit from such systems, companies need to have their products qualified through a regulatory process. There is no guarantee that any benefit could be gained. Gevo has not yet attempted to gain approval for programs such as LCFS.
