Item 1.Business
Overview
Vertex is a leading provider of enterprise tax technology solutions. Our software, content, and services help customers stay in compliance with indirect taxes that occur in taxing jurisdictions all over the world.
Collectively, indirect taxes refer to taxes that are collected and remitted to the government by an entity other than the one being taxed. As an example, sales tax is paid by a person or entity that is purchasing a product or service, but it is collected and remitted by the company or entity selling that product or service. This contrasts with direct taxes, such as income tax, which are paid directly by the entity being taxed.
Indirect taxes, such as sales tax, use tax, and value-added tax (“VAT”) are complex. In the United States (“U.S.”) alone, Vertex tax content addresses indirect taxes for over 13,000 unique taxing jurisdictions. Compounding the complexity, rules, regulations, and indirect tax rates are constantly changing. For a company doing business in multiple jurisdictions, compliance with these taxes is a significant challenge and one they encounter in literally every sale or purchase transaction they execute on a daily basis.
Vertex helps companies with complex tax operations to automate their indirect tax processes. Our software, content and services address the increasing complexities of global commerce and compliance by reducing friction, enhancing transparency, and enabling greater confidence in meeting indirect tax obligations. As a result, our software is ubiquitous within our customers' business systems, touching nearly every line item of every transaction that an enterprise can conduct. 
The rapid changes taking place in today's global business, technology and regulatory environments are having a compounding effect on the complexity of indirect tax management. As companies expand their business models by entering new geographies, enhancing their distribution channels, adding eCommerce capabilities, or transforming their digital footprint, they increase their exposure to indirect tax obligations. Additionally, as they expand their core offerings to incorporate new digital products and services, they are increasingly impacted by new tax regulations being pursued by jurisdictions. This complexity demands intelligent solutions that enable businesses to satisfy tax obligations and support growth opportunities.
We have pioneered tax technology for over 40 years. Today, we have over 4,200 customers, including the majority of the Fortune 500, and provide our customers with tax support in over 130 countries. Our software enables tax determination, compliance and reporting, tax data management and document management, and analytics and insights with powerful pre-built integrations to core business applications used by most companies, particularly those applications that have a significant impact on global commerce transactions. Our software is fueled by over 500 million data-driven effective tax rules and supports indirect tax compliance in more than 19,000 jurisdictions worldwide. Our solutions can be deployed in the cloud, on-premise environments, or at the network edge, all with implementation services available to enable optimal customer outcomes and satisfy unique business requirements.
Our Solutions
Our Vertex solutions can automate the end-to-end indirect tax processes for all companies with complex tax operations and audit risk. Our software includes tax determination, compliance and reporting, tax data management and document management tools, analytics and insights, as well as pre-built integrations to major business applications. Customers can utilize these solutions individually or as part of a broader suite and can choose the delivery model that best aligns to their enterprise technology environments.

● | Tax Determination. Our tax determination solutions enable real-time calculation of indirect taxes and applicable fees for sale and purchase transactions. This solution includes a powerful indirect tax calculation engine that applies rules-based logic from our proprietary content database to determine taxability, identify

precise taxing jurisdictions, and consistently apply the appropriate amount of tax to each transaction in real-time. Our solution supports determination for sales tax, consumer and seller use tax, VAT, communications tax, leasing tax, payroll tax and lodging and occupancy tax.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance and Reporting. Our compliance and reporting solutions enable the automation of signature-ready returns and remittance of indirect tax to appropriate jurisdictions. Companies use these solutions to leverage tax data files imported from Vertex or third-party applications to establish visible audit trails of tax determinations and user-made adjustments. Our solutions also include workflow management tools, such as calendar and document management, and role-based security and event logging, which supports our customers' internal control over financial reporting and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We support e-filing and print formats for returns, schedules, worksheets, tax reports and payment requests, and provide archiving and retrieval of all filings.

● | Tax Data Management. Our tax data management tools enable enterprises to unify transaction data from multiple business applications and sources. These solutions enable tax teams to view detailed transaction-level tax data, identify anomalies or errors, and establish necessary rules to address gaps in data and audit logs for any adjustments or corrections that have been made. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Document Management. Our document management solutions automate the validation and storage of, and tax audit support for, sales tax exemptions and reseller certificates, enabling enterprises to manage large quantities of documents, such as tax exemption certificates. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Analytics and Insights. Our analytics and insights tools improve data quality and provide data intelligence to optimize the end-to-end tax process and improve business outcomes. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pre-Built Integrations. Our solutions are supported by a suite of powerful, pre-built integrations that enable real-time coordination between our solutions and major business applications, such as Adobe/Magento, Coupa, Microsoft Dynamics, NetSuite, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, SAP Ariba, Workday and Zuora, among many others. Much more than traditional application programming interfaces, our integrations include mapping data fields, business logic and configurations to improve the processing of transactions to and from our solutions. The majority of our integrations are designed, tested and supported by us. We also allow for partner-developed integrations as part of a rigorous certification program. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industry-Specific Solutions. We offer a range of solutions that support certain industries that have specific indirect tax needs, such as retail, communications, and leasing. For example, our retail solution supports omnichannel transactions spanning store kiosks, eCommerce websites, catalog sales and mobile device transactions. Our communications solution supports the determination of taxes, surcharges and fees affecting U.S. providers of communication services, including wireless, voice-over-IP, satellite, internet and video and audio streaming services. We have pre-built integrations specific to the leading providers of business applications used by these industries. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technology Specific Solutions – Chain Flow Accelerator, SAP-specific tools. We offer a number of technology solutions that offer tools and enhancements to certain ecosystems, like SAP or Oracle, that are deeply integrated into their technology stack. For example, our Chain Flow Accelerator tool allows configuration of tax specific flows within the SAP stack. In addition, through the acquisition of LCR-Dixon Corporation (“LCR-Dixon”), in 2021, we acquired an SAP specific tool set that provides customers the ability to maintain, analyze and validate tax data in procure-to-pay as well as sales and billing systems that enhance its usefulness for indirect taxes as well as other business applications. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implementation Services. Due to the ubiquitous nature of our software in our customers' technology environments, we also offer implementation services to enable our customers to realize the full benefit of our solution at initial deployment. These software implementation services include configuration, data migration and implementation, and premium support and training.

Our Tax Content
All our software and solutions are underpinned by our proprietary content database, which currently supports over 500 million effective tax rules. Our content quality and accuracy are key components of our software subscriptions revenue and customer value. Our content quality and accuracy are critical to the longevity of our customer relationships. On a monthly basis, our content team combines legislative research, analysis, technical logic, and automation to embed updated rules into our software. Unlike many enterprise software solutions where maintenance and support are focused solely on periodic technology upgrades, our monthly updates are a critical element of allowing our customers to ensure that they are utilizing the latest tax changes to accurately calculate their indirect taxes.
Our Technology
Our software and solutions are built upon a robust set of technology capabilities designed for the flexibility, configurability, speed, and scale to handle complex tax scenarios and processing volumes and interoperability across core business applications.

● | Real-Time Engine. Our real-time engine determines the appropriate tax rules to apply to a line item in a transaction through a sequence of real-time processes that combine tax algorithms and tax content with transaction line-item level detail. Combining tax content stored as structured data with sequencing and decision tree logic results in one or more individual tax rules that are applied to each line item in a transaction. This is built within memory and cached for performance. The in-memory processes of the core calculation engine are tuned to accommodate high-volume and complex transactions at speed and scale. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Configuration. Our solutions are built to be highly configurable. Through our graphical user interfaces, users can configure and map their taxability to ensure the correct tax rules are executed. Our flexibility in configuration also extends to users who can create their own taxability rules, as appropriate. These user-defined taxability rules act as an override, providing flexibility to ensure that non-standard tax scenarios and processes can be addressed. Additionally, users can augment transactions entering and exiting the engine by building their own logic through our drag-and-drop experience. This logic is saved to then execute within the engine. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tax Geography. Accuracy in determining the appropriate taxation of a transaction depends on many factors, including detailed location information for where a transaction is occurring. We designed and created a proprietary solution for tax jurisdiction identification that leverages industry geographic information system tools and geospatial data. With our proprietary technology we are able to create and map multiple tax jurisdictions for a particular location and assign a unique identifier to each location so that it can be used by the engine to allow for higher accuracy. This technology is highly relevant to emerging economic shifts, such as the sharing economy, where the physical nexus of transactions is unclear, such as ride-sharing services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Security. Our application security framework allows our customers to define how users can interact with sensitive enterprise data and how they are authorized to use certain aspects of our software. Users are mapped to a set of predefined roles, and we provide our customers with the ability to create user-defined roles. User-defined role-based access can be defined on a screen-by-screen level and further refined with read and/or write privileges. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cloud Solutions. We provide cloud services from six geographically separate data centers located on two continents: North America and Europe. The data centers are paired for failover of operations to an alternate, geographically separate production facility in case any single data center becomes unavailable. All data centers are operated by leading vendors providing physical security, internet access, environmental controls, and data retention services.

Our Customers
Today, we serve a large, diverse, and growing global customer base. Our market leadership in key industries can be demonstrated by our relationships with many of the largest and most well-known companies in retail trade, wholesale trade, and manufacturing. Our customers include the majority of the Fortune 500, as well as a majority of the top 10 companies by revenue in industries such as retail, technology, and manufacturing, in addition to leading digital marketplaces. We have significant expansion opportunities with these customers driven by our growing product portfolio and geographic coverage.
A distinct and growing subset of our customer base includes digital marketplaces and various professional service providers, including accounting firms and outsourcing firms. Our robust technology and deep tax content differentiate us in our ability to serve the indirect tax needs of 7 of the top 10 digital marketplace providers in North America by revenue. These customers support tens of thousands of merchants who rely on their platform for their eCommerce transaction processing. We also support service providers such as outsourcing and accounting firms who use our technology to calculate tax and file tax returns for their end-customers. While we include these marketplaces and service providers in our customer counts, the tens of thousands of their end-user customers are not included in our customer counts.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 4,289 customers and our Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) per customer was over $100,500. While most of our revenue is currently generated by customers domiciled in the U.S., many of our customers are multinational organizations with global business operations. We also provide tax software solutions outside the U.S., primarily in Canada and Europe. No single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
Our Growth Strategies
We believe today's global commerce environment provides durable growth opportunities for our business. Our growth strategies include:

● | Retention and expansion of revenues from existing customers. The breadth of our solutions allows us to continually meet our customer needs, even as their needs expand in scope. For example, customers initially investing in sales tax determination may need support for other tax types, jurisdictions, and capabilities to manage their indirect tax lifecycle over time. As our customers evolve through acquisitions, expand their products and services, enter new geographies, and enhance their distribution channels, we believe their need for our software, services, and content will also grow. We plan to continue to invest in new innovations and enhance our solutions to support the ongoing retention and expansion of revenue from our existing customers. Our flexible, tiered revenue-based pricing model also results in our customers growing their spend with us as they grow and continue to use our solutions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acquire new customers. We believe the market for our software and solutions is large and underpenetrated, both in the U.S. and globally. As enterprise and mid-market companies continue to expand their business operations and their tax complexity grows, we expect demand for our solutions to increase among new customers and partners. We also expect these companies to adopt our solutions much earlier in their corporate lifecycle. This adoption is driven by advances in cloud computing and digital commerce, which enable more companies to accelerate new product delivery and scale their business through online marketplaces and emerging commerce platforms. These increases in business complexity necessitate advanced tax solutions for a broader number of companies. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales, indirect sales, and partnership marketing teams, and our solution development to capture this demand increase and acquire new customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broaden and deepen our partner ecosystem. We integrate with key technology partners that span enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), procurement, billing, point of sale (“POS”), and eCommerce platforms. Our partners enhance our go-to-market capacity and extend our brand leadership and reach. We leverage our partnerships to maximize the benefits of our solutions for our customers and to identify new growth opportunities. We believe expanding our strategic alliances with emerging participants who are fueling global commerce, such as payment and digital commerce platforms, will create new value for our customers and new sources of revenue. Future partnerships with large-scale

digital payments players will allow us to develop additional customer-centric solutions and further expand our customer base.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extend global footprint. We have a significant opportunity to further expand internationally, in terms of our regional operations, content depth and go-to-market coverage. We expect to continue to invest in our software and solutions outside of the U.S., most notably in Latin America and Europe. These jurisdictions are among the most complex and the largest international markets for our customers. We have also made significant investments in our own operations in these regions. In Europe and Brazil, for example, we have tailored our go-to-market strategy, enhanced our country-specific content database, and furthered our investment in our global compliance reporting solution. By extending our global footprint, we believe we will also expand account penetration of existing customers with operations around the globe. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sustained investment in new product innovation. With the pace of change in commerce and compliance, we believe it is important to continue innovating and extending the functionality and breadth of our software and solutions. Our approach to innovation is driven by our relationships with our customers and partners, with whom we create new solutions, align product roadmaps, and embed our software within their applications and platforms. We have also created and invest in an innovation lab where we design, test, and incubate next generation tax solutions and adjacent market opportunities. Over time, we expect such investment will bring additional value to existing customers and help us acquire new customers.

These partners include value-added resellers, service providers and original equipment manufacturer relationships with technology firms, system integrators, tax consultants and industry groups such as Avanade, Acumatica and CPA.com. These investments enable certification, training, and enablement to deliver rapid time-to-value and scale. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development
Our research and development team consists of our architecture, software engineering, user experience, infrastructure development operations automation and technical production support teams. This organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and delivery of new technologies, features and integrations of our tax software and solutions, as well as the continued improvement of our existing solutions.

We continue to invest in our research and development capabilities with significant focus on emerging technologies such as edge computing, artificial intelligence/machine learning, data fabric/mesh platforms, blockchain, application programming interface/microservices, and containerization to extend our solutions further into the cloud and partner ecosystems to continuously deliver more value.
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Businesses employ a mix of approaches to address their indirect tax obligations, including:

● | in-house practices and spreadsheets that result in custom transaction-specific research, manual determination, static tax tables or rate calculator services, as well as manual filing and remittance activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | businesses utilizing native ERP capabilities with rudimentary tax determination capabilities, which are typically not designed for complex tax support and lack tax rates, rules and complex calculation functionality and require the user to manually track, input, maintain and update all tax law changes that occur;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | outsourced transaction tax compliance services offered by accounting and specialized consulting firms; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | tax-specific solutions from other vendors.
--+-------------------------------------------

We believe customers consider the following factors when selecting indirect tax technologies:

● | ability to minimize compliance risk exposure associated with inaccurate and/or inconsistent determination and remittance of taxes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7





● | ability to deliver real time tax determinations;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | ease of deployment and use;
--+----------------------------


● | ease of integration with the customer's business applications, across multiple systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to address multiple transaction tax compliance functions, from initial taxability and tax rate determination through compliance and remittance of funds;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lower total cost of ownership; and
--+-----------------------------------


● | continuously updated tax content applicable to the customer's business.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depending on the importance and complexity associated with these factors for each customer we maintain varying competitive advantages. We monitor these factors and adjust our functionalities, service offerings, pricing structures and overall solution delivery approach to continually strengthen our position.
Intellectual Property
Our success has resulted in part from our proprietary methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret law, as well as contractual restrictions such as confidentiality and non-compete provisions to protect our intellectual property rights, including our brand, technology, and confidential information. We have policies related to security, privacy, confidentiality, ownership, and the use and protection of our intellectual property. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment/proprietary rights agreements with our consultants, employees and other third parties as appropriate that protect and control access to our intellectual property, and we enforce these agreements where necessary. We recognize the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace and vigorously identify, create, and protect it. We believe the innovation of our employees and our continued enhancement of the features and functionality of our solutions is the keystone of our success.
Human Capital 
Our culture is the foundation of everything we do, guided by a common purpose to build trusted relationships at work, in business and in our communities. We strive to be a values-driven employer of choice who attracts, retains, and inspires talented professionals to achieve their full potential. We have been recognized as one of the best places to work in Philadelphia for the past eight years according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. We create and nurture an engaging work environment that embodies our core values of collaboration, performance, integrity, innovation, and fun, and we actively support our employees' participation in community service and philanthropy. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 1,400 full-time employees. Of these employees, 89% were based in the U.S., 10% based in Europe and 1% in Latin America. We believe we have a strong relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages.
We have designed the following dashboards to power the business with human capital data to inform leaders on the development, attraction, and retention of personnel: Board Reporting, SEC Reporting and Program Management Reporting. These dashboards are maintained by our People and Culture and Recruiting teams. These dashboards present information regarding recruiting time to fill averages, retention of employees, workforce costs, diversity, employee engagement, training and development, culture initiatives, and workforce skills and capabilities.
