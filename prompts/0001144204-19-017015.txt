ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Village Bank and Trust Financial Corp. (“Company”) was incorporated in January 2003 and was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia as a bank holding company. The Company has three active wholly owned subsidiaries: Village Bank (the “Bank”), Southern Community Financial Capital Trust I, and Village Financial Statutory Trust II. The Bank has one active wholly owned subsidiary: Village Bank Mortgage Corporation (the “Mortgage Company”), a full service mortgage banking company. The Company is the holding company of and successor to the Bank. Effective April 30, 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of the Bank in a statutory share exchange transaction. Unless the context suggest otherwise, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer collectively to the Company, the Bank, and the Mortgage Company.
 
The Bank is the primary operating business of the Company. The Bank offers a wide range of banking and related financial services, including checking, savings, certificates of deposit and other depository services, and commercial, real estate and consumer loans, primarily in the Richmond, Virginia and Williamsburg, Virginia metropolitan areas. The Bank was organized in 1999 as a Virginia chartered bank to engage in a general banking business to serve the communities in and around Richmond, Virginia and expanded its services to Williamsburg, Virginia in 2017. Deposits with the Bank are insured to the maximum amount provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank offers a comprehensive range of financial services and products and specializes in providing customized financial services to small and medium sized businesses, professionals, and individuals. The Bank provides its customers with personal customized service utilizing the latest technology and delivery channels.
 
Bank revenues are derived from interest and fees received in connection with loans, deposits, and mortgage services. Administrative and operating expenses are the major expenses, followed by interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Revenues from the Mortgage Company consist primarily of gains from the sale of loans and loan origination fees and its major expenses consist of personnel, occupancy, data processing, and other operating expenses. In 2018, revenue (after intercompany eliminations) generated by the Bank totaled $22.8 million and the Mortgage Company generated $6.2 million in revenue.
 
Segment Reporting
 
The Company has two reportable segments: traditional commercial banking and mortgage banking. For more financial data and other information about each of the Company’s operating segments, refer to Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections, “Segment Information – Commercial Banking Segment” and “Segment Information – Mortgage Banking Segment”, and to Note 19 “Segment Reporting” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Business Strategy
 
We are implementing strategies that we believe will help us achieve our goal of delivering long-term total shareholder returns that rank in the top quartile of a nationwide peer group.  To achieve this goal, we believe that we will need to become a top performer in return on equity, produce sustainable earnings growth, achieve best quartile earnings volatility in our industry and deliver best quartile asset quality in the worst part of the economic cycle.  Our current business strategies include the following:

· | Build full service banking relationships with high quality local companies by being problem solvers and business builders, not just bankers. We will continue to build a team of bankers and leaders who are both great bankers and exceptional business people. We will have the capital, capabilities and connections to help business owners achieve their goals and overcome obstacles to their success. We target win-win outcomes. We expect to be disciplined lenders during the good times so that during difficult times we can support our good clients, win high quality relationships and recruit talented bankers while other banks focus on their own challenges. Real estate lending will continue to be an important part of our business. We intend to be diligent in managing overall portfolio concentrations, and we will focus on real estate sectors and sponsors that we expect to perform better during difficult times. We will understand the needs and goals of our business clients and their owners so that we can help them fulfill those needs and achieve those goals. We will target deposit only relationships as actively as we will target full loan and deposit relationships. Wherever possible and prudent, we will purchase products and services from the companies that do business with us to support our clients and thank them for their business.

· | Build long-term, mutually beneficial banking relationships with individuals and families in our market area. We will offer the basic financial products and services individuals and families in our communities need backed by exceptionally professional and caring service. We offer convenience and flexibility through in person, online, mobile and telephonic options for enrolling in new services, handling transactions and seeking service. We want to help our clients thrive on their journey through life. Through our own team members and business partners, we will help clients develop plans for handling the big moments they will encounter along the way. We will be experts at using technology to understand our clients, serve their needs and grow our business.

· | Grow the Mortgage Company’s profitability and positive contribution to our brand. We intend to add loan officers and production teams, more fully identify and serve the mortgage needs of bank clients, appropriately leverage available grant programs, offer portfolio mortgage products, and enhance our marketing efforts to grow mortgage banking revenues. We plan to continue to treat mortgage banking as a specialty line of business. We will continue to differentiate ourselves by treating the homeowners, realtors, builders and financial advisors who work with us to exceptionally professional and caring service.

· | Improve and sustain the economics of our balance sheet, income statement and business model: 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Defend and expand our Net Interest Margin by improving the mix of both assets and funding wherever possible. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Build and grow other non-interest income services to leverage our return on assets (“ROA”) and return on equity (“ROE”). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Streamline and rationalize our processes and organization to improve productivity and efficiency. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Include a prudent amount of debt in our holding company capital structure to leverage a strong ROA into an even stronger ROE. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Achieve excellence in risk management. We strive to achieve best quartile performance on credit quality metrics in the worst part of the business cycle and sustainable earnings growth over the long term. Risk taking is a fundamental part of banking. Top performing banks are very good at identifying, understanding, measuring, monitoring, managing, mitigating and getting paid for the risks the organization takes. We are committed to building and sustaining the culture, talent, tools, policies, processes and discipline needed to be a top performer in our risk management functions.

· | Be the place where exceptional people want to work. We are committed to achieving great things and need teammates who share that commitment. We will sustain our fun, fulfilling and rewarding work environment built on trust and teamwork. We know that we will achieve our goals by fielding a team of champions, not by building our business around individual stars. We are a meritocracy where every individual knows he or she can make a difference every day, where their individual contributions are valued, where we invest in our teammates, and where we hold people accountable. We will invest in technology to leverage the talents of our associates and provide the flexibility to allow them to manage their work and life priorities effectively. We will offer benefits and resources intended to help our team members be fit to thrive on their journey through life. When we make difficult business decisions, we will do so with sensitivity to and understanding of the consequences of those decisions.

· | Make a lasting difference in our communities. We will invest our work, wisdom and wealth to help our communities prepare young people for success in life, help families navigate the complex maze of modern life and support and honor the individuals who serve and protect us. We believe that we can be particularly effective in serving our many stakeholders by being a leader in education and workforce development initiatives in our community because success in these areas will help individuals and families provide for themselves and will provide businesses with the talented employees they need to grow and prosper.

We strongly believe that there is a continuing need for banks like Village with deep community roots and that a well-run community based bank can generate attractive returns for shareholders over the long term. 
 
Market Area 
 
The Company, the Bank, and the Mortgage Company are headquartered in Chesterfield County and primarily serve the Central Virginia region and the Richmond and Williamsburg Metropolitan Statistical Areas. We currently conduct business from ten full-service branch banking offices, and a mortgage loan production office in Central Virginia in the counties of Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico, Powhatan and James City. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded into the Williamsburg, Virginia market through the opening of a new Village Bank branch. At the end of the first quarter of 2017, we closed our Manassas, Virginia mortgage production office after the departure of its long term leader.
Banking Services
 
Deposit Services. Deposits are a major source of our funding. The Bank offers a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most banks and other financial institutions including checking accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer term certificates of deposit and Individual Retirement Accounts. These deposit accounts are offered at rates competitive with other institutions in our market area. We service our deposit clients in our full-service branches, at drive-up windows, at our ATMs, through our customer care team and through technology such as online banking, mobile banking applications and remote deposit capture for business clients. We have not applied for permission to establish a trust department and offer trust services. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. Deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (the “FDI Act”) to the limits provided thereunder.
Lending Services. We offer a full range of short-to-medium term commercial and personal loans. We also provide a wide range of real estate finance services. Our primary focus is on making loans in the Central Virginia and greater Williamsburg markets where we have branch banking offices. We offer residential construction-to-permanent financing to clients of the Mortgage Company.

· | Commercial Business Lending. We make secured and unsecured loans to small- and medium-sized businesses for purposes such as funding working capital needs (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisition of real estate and improvements) and purchase of equipment and machinery. We also make loans under Small Business Administration and state sponsored business loan programs. In our underwriting, we evaluate the earnings and cash flows of the business, guarantor support and both the need for and the protection offered by the collateral for the loan.

· | Commercial Real Estate Acquisition, Development, Construction and Mortgage Lending. We make loans to our clients for the purposes of acquiring, developing, constructing and owning commercial real estate. These properties may be owner-occupied or may be held for investment purposes and repaid from rental income or from the sale of the property. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer Lending. Consumer loans include secured and unsecured loans for financing automobiles, home improvements, education and personal investments. We also originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans and real estate construction and acquisition loans. Residential loans originated by our mortgage company are usually sold in the secondary mortgage market. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Loan Participations. We sell loan participations in the ordinary course of business when a loan originated by us exceeds our legal lending limit or we otherwise deem it prudent to share the risk with another lending institution. Additionally, we purchase loan participations from other banks, usually without recourse against that bank. We underwrite purchased loan participations in accordance with normal underwriting practices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Loan Purchases. We purchase Federal Rehabilitated Student Loan portfolios when approved by the board of directors. These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (“DOE”) which covers approximately 98% of the principal and interest. These loans are serviced by a third party servicer that specializes in handling these types of loans. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also purchase the guaranteed portion of United State Department of Agriculture Loans (“USDA”) which are guaranteed by the USDA for 100% of the principal and interest. The originating institution holds the unguaranteed portion of the loan and services the loan. These loans are typically purchased at a premium. In the event of a loan default or early prepayment the Bank may need to write off any unamortized premium.
 
Lending Limit. As of December 31, 2018, our legal lending limit for loans to one borrower was approximately $7,489,000. However, we generally limit credit to any one individual or entity to a maximum of $5,000,000.
Competition
 
We encounter strong competition from other local commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds, financial technology companies, and other financial institutions. A number of these competitors are well-established. Competition for loans is keen, and pricing is important. Most of our competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than ours and offer certain services, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services, which we do not provide at the present time. Deposit competition also is strong, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits. Nationwide banking institutions and their branches have increased competition in our markets, and federal legislation adopted in 1999 allows non-banking companies, such as insurance and investment firms, to establish or acquire banks. We believe that the Company can capitalize on recent merger activity to attract customers from the acquired institutions.
 
At June 30, 2018, the latest date such information is available from the FDIC, the Bank’s deposit market share in Chesterfield County was 4.75%, 4.15% in Hanover County, 8.89% in Powhatan County, 0.40% in the Richmond metropolitan statistical area and 0.10% in Henrico County and 0.51% in James City County.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
We are subject to extensive regulation by certain federal and state agencies and receive periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. As a consequence, our business is affected by state and federal legislation and regulations.

The discussion below is only a summary of the principal laws and regulations that comprise the regulatory framework applicable to us. The descriptions of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations.
 
General.  The Company is qualified as a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"), and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve").  As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file various reports and additional information with the Federal Reserve.  The Company is also registered under the bank holding company laws of Virginia and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the "BFI"). The Bank is a Virginia chartered bank and is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.  The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC and the BFI.
The Dodd-Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, although many of its provisions (e.g., the interchange and trust preferred capital limitations) apply to companies that are significantly larger than the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act directs applicable regulatory authorities to promulgate regulations implementing its provisions, and its effect on the Company and on the financial services industry as a whole will be clarified as those regulations are issued. Major elements of the Dodd-Frank Act are described below.
Increased Capital Standards.  The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies. See “Capital Adequacy” below for a discussion of these requirements.
Deposit Insurance.  The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the FDI Act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) are calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base is no longer the institution’s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act made changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that depository institutions may pay interest on demand deposits.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).  The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, an independent federal agency with broad rule-making, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more of assets. Smaller institutions, such as the Company, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but are examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes.
Limits on Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to, among other things, require that debit card interchange fees must be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost incurred by the institution with respect to the transaction. In June 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted regulations applicable to institutions with $10 billion or more of assets that established a maximum permissible interchange fee that an institution may charge. Under the regulations, the maximum permissible interchange fee for such institutions is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional adjustment of up to one cent per transaction if the institution implements additional fraud-prevention standards. Although institutions that have assets of less than $10 billion are exempt, these regulations are expected to significantly affect the interchange fees that institutions with less than $10 billion of assets are able to collect.

Recent Amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, which was signed into law on May 24, 2018 (the “EGRRCPA”), amended the Dodd-Frank Act to provide regulatory relief for certain smaller and regional financial institutions. The EGRRCPA, among other things, provides financial institutions with less than $10 billion of assets with relief from certain capital requirements and exempts banks with less than $250 billion of total consolidated assets from the enhanced prudential standards and the company-run and supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and may in the future have, a material impact on the Company’s operations, particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from new and possible future consumer and fair lending regulations.
 
Reporting Obligations Under Securities Laws. The Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including the requirement to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) annual, quarterly and other reports on the financial condition and performance of the organization. The Company’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and, as a result, the Company is subject to the rules and listing standards adopted by The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”). The Company is also affected by the corporate responsibility and accounting reform legislation signed into law on July 30, 2002, known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “SOX Act”), and the related rules and regulations. The SOX Act includes provisions that, among other things, require that periodic reports containing financial statements that are filed with the SEC be accompanied by chief executive officer and chief financial officer certifications as to the accuracy and compliance with law, additional disclosure requirements and corporate governance and other related rules. The Company has expended considerable time and money in complying with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, and with the SOX Act, and expects to continue to incur additional expenses in the future.
Bank Holding Company Act.  The Federal Reserve has jurisdiction under the BHC Act to approve any bank or non-bank acquisition, merger or consolidation proposed by a bank holding company. The BHC Act, and other applicable laws and regulations, generally limit the activities of a bank holding company and its subsidiaries to that of banking, managing or controlling banks, or any other activity that is so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.
 
In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve must consider whether the performance of such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company may result from such an activity.
 
Support of Subsidiary Institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, and previously under Federal Reserve policy, the Company is required to act as a source of financial strength for the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. This support can be required at times when it would not be in the best interest of the Company’s shareholders or creditors to provide it. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. The Company has periodically raised capital and contributed it to the Bank to support the Bank’s operations.

Privacy Legislation. Several laws, including the Right To Financial Privacy Act and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, provide protections against the transfer and use of customer information by financial institutions. Financial Institutions generally are prohibited from disclosing customer information to non-affiliated third parties, unless the customer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions must disclose their specific privacy policies to their customers annually and must conduct an internal risk assessment of their ability to protect customer information.
Mergers and Acquisitions. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the "Interstate Banking Act"), generally permits well capitalized and adequately managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, and preempts all state laws restricting the ownership by a bank holding company of banks in more than one state. The Interstate Banking Act also permits a bank to merge with an out-of-state bank and convert any offices into branches of the resulting bank if both states have not opted out of interstate branching; and permits a bank to acquire branches from an out-of-state bank if the law of the state where the branches are located permits the interstate branch acquisition. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company or bank must be well capitalized and well managed to engage in an interstate acquisition. Bank holding companies and banks are required to obtain prior Federal Reserve approval to acquire more than 5% of a class of voting securities, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company, bank or savings association. The Interstate Banking Act and the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish and operate de novo interstate branches to the same extent a bank chartered by the host state may establish branches. Virginia law permits branching across state lines, provided there is reciprocity with the state in which the out-of-state bank is based.
 
Limits on the Payment of Dividends. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. Virtually all of the Company’s cash revenues will result from dividends paid to it by the Bank, which is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends that it can pay. Under Virginia law, a bank may not declare a dividend in excess of its accumulated retained earnings without approval by the BFI. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank did not have any accumulated retained earnings. In addition, the Bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the Bank would be "undercapitalized," as defined in FDIC regulations.
 
The FDIC and the state have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if the payment is deemed an unsafe and unsound practice. Both the FDIC and the state have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice.
 
In addition, the Company is subject to certain regulatory requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. These regulatory requirements regarding capital affect our dividend policies. Regulators have indicated that holding companies should generally pay dividends only if the organization's net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidelines that bank holding companies should inform and consult with the Federal Reserve in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization’s capital structure.
 
Insurance of Accounts, Assessments and Regulation by the FDIC. Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law, currently $250,000. We are subject to the deposit insurance assessments of the DIF. On April 1, 2011, the deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity, pursuant to a rule issued by the FDIC as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC changed its deposit insurance pricing to a “financial ratios method” based on CAMELS composite ratings to determine assessment rates for small established institutions with less than $10 billion of assets, such as the Bank. The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk (“CAMELS”). CAMELS composite ratings set a maximum assessment for CAMELS 1 and 2 rated banks, and set minimum assessments for lower rated institutions.

The FDIC is authorized to prohibit any DIF-insured institution from engaging in any activity that the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the respective insurance fund. Also, the FDIC may initiate enforcement actions against banks, after first giving the institution’s primary regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any depository institution if it determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If deposit insurance is terminated, the deposits at the institution at the time of termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period from six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. We are aware of no existing circumstances that could result in termination of our deposit insurance.
 
Capital Adequacy. Both the Company and the Bank are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, in the case of the Company, and the FDIC, in the case of the Bank. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Capital Rules”).  The Basel III Capital Rules implement minimum capital ratios and establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules require banks and bank holding companies to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (1) a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer” (effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); (2) a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%); (3) a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%); and (4) a leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until it was fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.  Banking organizations with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
 
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Among other things, these standards revise the standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the proposed framework, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2022, with an aggregate output floor phasing-in through January 1, 2027. Under the current capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulatory agencies.

The Company meets the eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (the “SBHC Policy Statement”). On August 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule required by the EGRRCPA that expands the applicability of the SBHC Policy Statement to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $3 billion (up from the prior $1 billion threshold). Under the SBHC Policy Statement, qualifying bank holding companies, such as the Company, have additional flexibility in the amount of debt they can issue and are also exempt from the Basel III Capital Rules. The SBHC Policy Statement does not apply to the Bank and the Bank must comply with the Basel III Capital Rules. The Bank must also comply with the capital requirements set forth in the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDI Act, as described below.
 
On November 21, 2018, the federal bank regulators jointly issued a proposed rule required by the EGRRCPA that would permit qualifying banks and bank holding companies that have less than $10 billion of assets, like the Company and the Bank, to elect to be subject to a 9% leverage ratio that would be applied using less complex leverage calculations (commonly referred to as the community bank leverage ratio or “CBLR”). Under the proposed rule, banks and bank holding companies that opt into the CBLR framework and maintain a CBLR of greater than 9% would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and would be deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the “prompt corrective action” framework. The rule is in proposed form so the content and scope of the final rule, and its impact on the Company and the Bank (if any), cannot be determined.
 
Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking agencies have broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” These terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies regulating these institutions. An insured depository institution that is less than adequately capitalized must adopt an acceptable capital restoration plan, is subject to increased regulatory oversight and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities.
 
To be well capitalized under these regulations, a bank must have the following minimum capital ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%; (2) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%; and (4) a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.70%, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.70%, its total risk-based capital ratio was 12.46% and its leverage ratio was 9.15%.  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, the Bank met the minimum ratios to be classified as well capitalized.  More information concerning our regulatory ratios at December 31, 2018 is included in Note 13 to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
As described above, on November 21, 2018, the federal bank regulators jointly issued a proposed rule required by the EGRRCPA that would permit qualifying banks and bank holding companies that have less than $10 billion of consolidated assets to elect to opt into the CBLR framework. Banks opting into the CBLR framework and maintaining a CBLR of greater than 9% would be deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the “prompt corrective action” framework. The rule is in proposed form so the content and scope of the final rule, and its impact on the Company and the Bank (if any), cannot be determined.
 
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. Both the Company and the Bank are subject to the provisions of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 23A places limits on the amount of: (1) a bank’s loans or extensions of credit, including purchases of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, to affiliates; (2) a bank’s investment in affiliates; (3) assets a bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; (4) the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or debt obligations of affiliates; (5) transactions involving the borrowing or lending of securities and any derivative transaction that results in credit exposure to an affiliate; and (6) a bank’s guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate.

The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank’s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid acquiring low-quality assets from its affiliates.
 
The Company and the Bank are also subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.
 
The Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and (2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to a bank insider (or their related interests) unless (1) the transaction is conducted on market terms between the parties, and (2) if the proposed transaction represents more than 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured institution, it has been approved in advance by a majority of the institution’s non-interested directors.
 
Incentive Compensation Policies and Restrictions. In July 2010, the federal banking agencies issued guidance that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies (thereby including both the Company and the Bank). Pursuant to the guidance, to be consistent with safety and soundness principles, a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should: (1) provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; (2) be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organization’s board of directors. Monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation. At December 31, 2018, we had not been made aware of any instances of non-compliance with this guidance. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the appropriate federal regulators to establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or bank that provides an insider or other employee with “excessive compensation” or that could lead to a material financial loss to such firm. These standards have not yet been established.
Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), which is intended to require financial institutions to develop policies, procedures and practices to prevent and deter money laundering, mandates that every bank have a written, board-approved program that is reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA. The program must, at a minimum: (i) provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance; (ii) provide for independent testing for compliance; (iii) designate an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance; and (iv) provide training for appropriate personnel. In addition, a bank is required to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose.  The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, requires bank regulators to consider a financial institution’s compliance with the BSA when reviewing applications from a financial institution.  In May 2016, the regulations implementing the BSA were amended to explicitly include risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, to include understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile. In addition, banks must identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers (other than those that are excluded) at the time a new account is opened (other than accounts that are exempted). These amendments and new requirements became effective for the Bank on May 11, 2018.

Reporting Terrorist Activities. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which is a division of the Department of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to insure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with “enemies” of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent, and will send, our banking regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the FBI. The Bank has appointed an OFAC compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications. The Bank actively checks high-risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. The Bank performs these checks utilizing software, which is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.
Mortgage Banking Regulation. The Mortgage Company is subject to the rules and regulations by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Administration, the Department of Veteran Affairs and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing, servicing and selling mortgage loans. Those rules and regulations, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and, in some cases, restrict certain loan features, and fix maximum interest rates and fees. In addition to other federal laws, mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. These laws prohibit discrimination, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level.
Other Safety and Soundness Regulations. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on depository institutions by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insurance funds in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default. The Federal banking agencies also have broad powers under current Federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, as defined by the law. Federal regulatory authorities also have broad enforcement powers over us, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver in order to conserve the assets of any such institution for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. At December 31, 2018, the Bank met the ratio requirements to be classified as a well capitalized financial institution.
 
Loans-to-One Borrower. Under applicable laws and regulations the amount of loans and extensions of credit which may be extended by a bank to any one borrower, including related entities, generally may not exceed 15% of the sum of the capital, surplus, and loan loss reserve of the institution.
 
Community Reinvestment. The requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) are applicable to the Company. The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A financial institution’s efforts in meeting community credit needs currently are evaluated as part of the examination process pursuant to 12 assessment factors. These factors also are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility.

Cybersecurity. In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Company fails to observe the regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. To date, we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.
Tax Reform. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”). The legislation made key changes to the U.S. tax law, including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 and recognized $4,181,000 in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. Although the Tax Reform Act had a significant negative impact on the Company’s earnings for 2017 because of the re-valuation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% had a positive benefit to the Company in 2018 and is expected to have a continued positive benefit in future periods.
Future Legislation and Regulation. Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which we operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to business strategy, and limit the ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.
