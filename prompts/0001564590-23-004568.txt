Item 1. Business. 
Business Overview
 Adit EdTech Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as an “initial business combination”. Our Sponsor is an affiliate of Adit, an investment adviser whose principals have combined investment experience of over 150 years and a track record of value creation in portfolio companies operating in the public markets.
 On January 14, 2021, we completed our IPO of 24,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (our “common stock”), and one-half of one redeemable IPO warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, pursuant to our registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-251641 and 333-252021). The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $240,000,000.
 On January 14, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we completed a private placement (the “private placement”) of an aggregate of 6,550,000 warrants (such warrants, the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $6,550,000.
 A total of $240,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the private placement was deposited in a trust account (the “trust account”) established for the benefit of our public stockholders.
 On January 19, 2021, pursuant to an exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, the underwriters purchased an additional 3,600,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $36,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional units, we sold an additional 720,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $720,000. As of January 19, 2021, an aggregate amount of $276,000,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO (including the additional 3,600,000 units and additional 720,000 private placement warrants) were deposited in our trust account.
 On December 23, 2022, we held a special meeting of our stockholders (the “extension meeting”), at which our stockholders approved a proposal to extend the extension date up to six times at the election of the board of directors for an additional one month each time for a maximum of six one-month extensions. We provided holders of IPO Shares with the ability to redeem such IPO Shares in connection with the  extension meeting. Stockholders holding 25,132,578 IPO Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds then on deposit in the trust account for approximately $253.6 million (approximately $10.09 per share). As of December 31, 2022 there is currently approximately $25 million held in the trust account and $0.1 million in cash held outside of the trust account available for working capital.
 Proposed Merger with GRIID
 On November 29, 2021, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with ADEX Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our wholly owned direct subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), and GRIID, which was amended by the first amendment to the Merger Agreement, dated December 23, 2021, the second amendment to the Merger Agreement, dated October 17, 2022 and the third amendment to the Merger Agreement, dated February 8, 2023 (such agreement, as amended, the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into GRIID, the separate limited liability company existence of Merger Sub will cease and GRIID, as the surviving company of the Merger, will continue its existence under the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of ADEX. The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were unanimously approved by the board of directors of ADEX and the board of managers of GRIID.

Consideration and Structure
 At the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), the limited liability company membership interests of Merger Sub will be converted into an equivalent limited liability company membership interest in GRIID and each limited liability company membership unit of GRIID that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will automatically be converted into and become the right to receive such unit’s proportionate share, as determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement, of 58,500,000 shares of our common stock.
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
 The parties to the Merger Agreement have agreed to customary representations and warranties for transactions of this type. In addition, the parties to the Merger Agreement agreed to be bound by certain customary covenants for transactions of this type, including, among others, covenants with respect to our conduct and the conduct of GRIID and each of our respective subsidiaries during the period between execution of the Merger Agreement and Closing, and restrictions on GRIID’s and our ability to solicit or enter into agreements with respect to any alternative transactions to the Merger. The representations, warranties, agreements and covenants of the parties set forth in the Merger Agreement will terminate at Closing, except for those covenants and agreements that, by their terms, contemplate performance after Closing. Each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and things reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Conditions to Closing
 Under the Merger Agreement, the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including, without limitation: (i) the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby by requisite vote of our stockholders (the “ADEX Stockholder Approval”); (ii) the approval of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby by the written consent of GRIID members that hold at least the requisite number of issued and outstanding units of GRIID (the “GRIID Written Consent”); (iii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iv) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (v) in the case of GRIID, the absence of an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect or Acquiror Impairment Effect (each, as defined in the Merger Agreement), and in our case, the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect or Company Impairment Effect (each, as defined in the Merger Agreement) since the date of the Merger Agreement that, in the case of an Acquiror Impairment Effect or Company Impairment Effect, is continuing; (vi) after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, we have net tangible assets (“NTA”) of at least $5,000,001 upon consummation of the Merger; (vii) our listing application with the NYSE American (or such other stock exchange on which our shares are listed as of such time) in connection with the Merger has been approved and, immediately following the effective time of the Merger, we will satisfy any applicable initial and continuing listing requirements of NYSE American (or such other stock exchange on which our shares are listed as of such time), and we have not received any notice of non-compliance therewith that has not been cured or would not be cured at or immediately following the effective time, and the shares of common stock have been approved for listing on NYSE American; (viii) the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary materiality and material adverse effect standards; (ix) the other party’s compliance in all material respects with its covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement; and (x) the Registration Statement on Form S-4 related to the shares of our common stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (the “S-4 Registration Statement”) has become effective, no stop order has been issued by the SEC and remains in effect with respect to the S-4 Registration Statement, and no proceeding seeking such a stop order has been threatened or initiated by the SEC and remains pending. We intend to solicit at a special meeting of stockholders votes to approve a proposal to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to remove the requirement in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that we have at least $5,000,001 of NTA to effect any redemptions. The parties to the Merger Agreement intend to amend the Merger Agreement prior to Closing to remove the condition that we have at least $5,000,001 of NTA remaining after our stockholders have exercised their right to redeem their shares in connection with the Closing.
 
7

Termination
 The Merger Agreement includes a remedy of specific performance for the parties. The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary circumstances at any time prior to the Closing, including, (i) by mutual written consent of GRIID and us; (ii) by us or GRIID, if (a) the other party has breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in the Merger Agreement and such breach has caused the failure of the closing condition related to the accuracy of such other party’s representations and warranties or such other party’s compliance with its covenants (subject to a cure period), (b) any governmental entity has issued a final, non-appealable order or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (c) our stockholder meeting to vote on the Merger has been held and the ADEX Stockholder Approval has not been obtained or (d) the GRIID Written Consent has not been obtained in the time period set forth in the Merger Agreement; or (iii) by us if the Closing has not occurred on or before January 14, 2023 (the “termination date”); provided, that the right to terminate the Merger Agreement under this section will not be available to us, if any breach by us of our covenants or obligations under the Merger Agreement proximately caused the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on or before the termination date, or if any proceeding for specific performance to compel the closing is pending as of the termination date; provided, that the termination date may be extended for successive 90 day periods by us in our sole discretion;.
 If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, none of the parties to the Merger Agreement will have any liability or any further obligation under the Merger Agreement other than customary confidentiality obligations, except in the case of Willful Breach or Fraud (each, as defined in the Merger Agreement).
 Other Agreements
 The Merger Agreement contemplates the execution of various additional agreements and instruments, on or before the Closing, including, among others, the following:
 Voting Agreement
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a Voting Agreement with Griid Holdings LLC (the “Voting Agreement”) covering approximately 64.0% of GRIID’s membership units. The Voting Agreement requires, among other things, that Griid Holdings LLC vote all of its membership units of GRIID in favor of, or execute written consents to approve, upon effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and against alternative transactions.
Investor Rights Agreement
 In connection with the Closing, we, our initial stockholders and certain GRIID members will enter into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) to provide for certain registration rights related to shares of our common stock and private placement warrants held by such parties. We have agreed to, among other things, file within 30 days of Closing a resale shelf registration statement covering the resale of all securities registrable under the Investor Rights Agreement.
 Copies of the Merger Agreement; the first, second and third amendments to the Merger Agreement; the Voting Agreement and the form of Investor Rights Agreement are filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibits 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing descriptions of such agreements and the Merger do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference thereto.
 The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the parties made to each other as of the date of the Merger Agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement is being filed to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the parties to the Merger Agreement and neither the copy of the Merger 
 
8

Agreement filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report nor the description of the Merger Agreement above is intended to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about us contained in our other public reports filed with the SEC. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties (including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts) and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors, security holders and reports and documents filed with the SEC. Investors and security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and other terms of the Merger Agreement may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe:

• | are fundamentally sound and that we believe are underperforming their potential;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are in a position to utilize our management team’s global network of contacts, which can provide access to differentiated deal flow and significant deal-sourcing capabilities following a business combination;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise or new operational techniques to drive improved financial performance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital and a need for capital to achieve the company’s growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders; the potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have been materially impacted by possible market dislocations or that have new market opportunities and would benefit from capital markets access.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this annual report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
 Initial Business Combination
 The NYSE American rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a 
 
9

definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE American, these rules will not be applicable to us.
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we expect to only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the NYSE American’s 80% fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 Our Sponsor
 Our Sponsor is a special purpose vehicle affiliated with Adit. Our Sponsor is majority-owned by an affiliate of Adit and our management team. Adit, which was founded in 2014, is a New York-based investment adviser with a fundamental approach to investing primarily in late-stage growth capital investments in top performing pre-IPO companies. Adit seeks to produce superior risk-adjusted returns by employing a disciplined, fundamentally based, value-driven, thematic portfolio construction. Adit’s management team invests in every deal on the same terms as its investors.
 The following characteristics summarize Adit’s investment portfolio:
  
• | market-leading companies with proven management, backed by top-tier venture capital investors, with strong cash flows and profitability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | dynamic and sustainable businesses with large addressable markets, scalable revenue models, and strong management teams with proper governance, positive environmental and sustainability record; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | diversified across industry, geography and economic sectors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 Adit’s investment team conducts substantial business, financial and legal due diligence on every investment opportunity. We believe Adit’s platform will provide us with key advantages, including (i) extensive research capabilities and industry expertise, (ii) deal flow from institutional client relationships, banks, brokers and other intermediaries, (iii) a strong network of proven operators, executives, board members and industry advisors with expertise across various industries, (iv) an ability to attract talented investment professionals and advisors, and (v) significant experience in positioning companies for success in the public equity markets through a focus on operational value creation implemented according to specific, executable plans, along with enhanced corporate governance. Additionally, we believe that Adit’s reputation with institutional equity investors will ensure that investors consider the pro-forma impact of a business combination and the value creation plan that we intend to implement.
 
10

Other Interests
 Our management team are not required to commit any specific amount of time to our affairs, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. Accordingly, our founders and management team may have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.
 We believe our Sponsor’s, management team’s and their affiliates’ operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Our Sponsor and management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our Sponsor’s and management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our Sponsor in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. 
 We also may engage Adit, or another affiliate of our Sponsor, as our lead financial advisor in connection with our initial business combination and may pay such affiliate a customary financial advisory fee in an amount that constitutes a market standard financial advisory fee for comparable transactions.
 Lack of Business Diversification
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors or industry advisors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
11

Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest will be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding  IPO Shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the representative of the underwriters. Our Sponsor, directors and officers have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the founder shares and any IPO Shares they may acquire after the IPO in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
 Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination.
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
  
• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our initial stockholders will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our IPO Shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, we will not redeem any IPO Shares unless our NTA will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
12

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
  
• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the then outstanding shares of common stock present and entitled to vote at the meeting to approve the initial business combination are voted in favor of the business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its IPO Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our Sponsor, directors and officers have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the shares of common stock they hold in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our IPO Shares unless our NTA are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 However, in connection with our proposed business combination with GRIID, we expect to seek stockholder approval to remove from our current amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to the Closing (i) the limitation on our ability to redeem or repurchase IPO Shares in connection with the consummation of an initial business combination to the extent such redemption would result in our failure to have NTA in excess of $5 million after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (the “redemption limitation), and (ii) the limitation that we shall consummate an initial business combination following stockholder approval thereof only if the redemption limitation is not exceeded.
 Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any excess shares (such shares, “Excess Shares”). We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our Sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares issued in the IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business 
 
13

combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with Redemption Rights
 In connection with any stockholder meeting to approve an initial business combination, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials mailed to such holders. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our proxy materials until the date set forth in such proxy materials to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their IPO Shares.
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker such nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used historically by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business combination is approved.
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials. Furthermore, if a holder of an IPO Share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our IPO Shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 If our initial proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until the applicable extension deadline.

Redemption of  IPO Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
 On December 23, 2022, we held the extension meeting, at which our stockholders approved a proposal to extend the date by which we must complete an initial business combination up to six times at the election of our board of directors for an additional one month each time for a maximum of six one-month extensions. We provided holders of IPO Shares with the ability to redeem such IPO Shares in connection with the extension meeting. Stockholders holding 25,132,578 IPO Shares exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds then on deposit in the trust account for approximately $253.6 million (approximately $10.09 per share), leaving approximately $25.0 million in the trust account as of December 31, 2022.
 We will have until the applicable extension date, the latest of which is July 14, 2023 if our board of directors approves all six one-month extensions allowed under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination by the applicable extension date (and our stockholders have not amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend this time period), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the IPO Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding IPO Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by the applicable extension date.
 Our Sponsor, directors and officers have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the applicable extension date. However, if they acquire IPO Shares after the IPO, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such IPO Shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the applicable extension date.
 Our Sponsor, directors and officers have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or to redeem 100% of our IPO Shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the applicable extension date or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations divided by the number of then outstanding IPO Shares. However, under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we may not redeem our IPO Shares unless our NTA are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of a business combination.
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
 However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay our tax obligations, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver.
 In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a definitive agreement for a business combination, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per IPO Share or (ii) such lesser amount per IPO Share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations and up to $100,000 for liquidation expenses, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account (even if such waiver is deemed to be unenforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy this indemnity obligation nor have we asked it to reserve for such eventuality and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per IPO Share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of the shares of common stock held by our public stockholders. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per IPO Share or (ii) such lesser amount per IPO Share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations and up to $100,000 for liquidation expenses, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligation or that it has no indemnification obligation related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligation. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligation to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the 
 
16

independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per IPO Share.
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors and the underwriters in the IPO), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.  In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our IPO Shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by the applicable extension date may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our IPO Shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by the applicable extension date, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by the applicable extension date, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the IPO Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding IPO Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our IPO Shares as soon as reasonably possible after the applicable extension date, and therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors and the underwriters in the IPO), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our 
 
17

Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per IPO Share or (ii) such lesser amount per IPO Share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay our tax obligations and up to $100,000 for liquidation expenses, and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our IPO Shares if we do not complete our business combination by the applicable extension date or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 Additional Information Regarding Our Proposed Initial Business Combination
 We have filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a proxy statement and a prospectus, and we will file other documents regarding the Merger. The definitive proxy statement/prospectus will also be sent to our stockholders and GRIID’s members, seeking any required stockholder approvals. We urge you to carefully read the entire registration statement and proxy statement/prospectus and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, including any amendments or supplements to these documents, because they contain important information about the proposed transactions, including detailed descriptions of the Merger and a discussion of historical information and risks relating to the Merger. The documents filed by us with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the Merger described above.
 Employees
 We currently have three executive officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 We registered our units, common stock and IPO Warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
18

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th; and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th and our annual revenues exceeds $100 million during such completed fiscal year or (2) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th.
