 GENERAL
 We design and market Skechers-branded lifestyle footwear for men, women and children, and performance footwear for men and women under the Skechers Performance brand name. Our footwear reflects a combination of innovation, style, comfort, quality and value that appeals to a broad range of consumers. Our brands are sold through department and specialty stores, athletic and independent retailers, boutiques and internet retailers. In addition to wholesale distribution, our footwear is available at our e-commerce websites and our own retail stores. As of February 1, 2019, we owned and operated 113 concept stores, 170 factory outlet stores and 187 warehouse outlet stores in the United States, and 134 concept stores, 78 factory outlet stores, and 10 warehouse outlet stores internationally. Our objective is to profitably grow our operations worldwide while leveraging our recognizable Skechers brand through our diversified product lines, innovative advertising and diversified distribution channels.
 We seek to offer consumers a vast array of stylish and comfortable footwear that satisfies their active, casual, dress casual and athletic footwear needs. Our core consumers are style-conscious men and women attracted to our relevant brand image, fashion-forward designs and affordable product, as well as athletes and fitness enthusiasts attracted to our performance footwear. Many of our best-selling and core styles are also developed for children with colors and materials that reflect a playful image appropriate for this demographic. Further, we offer children a unique collection of footwear designed just for them, including those with innovative light technology.
 We believe that brand recognition is an important element for success in the footwear business. We have aggressively marketed our brands through comprehensive marketing campaigns for men, women and children. During 2018, the Skechers brand was supported by print, television, digital and outdoor campaigns for men and women; animated and live action kids’ television and digital campaigns; marathons and other events for Skechers Performance and BOBS from Skechers divisions. To further drive recognition, we have enlisted numerous celebrities, former and current athletes, and influencers to appear in our campaigns, including globally-known recording artists Camila Cabello; sports legends Sugar Ray Leonard, Howie Long, David Ortiz, and Tony Romo; and television personalities and actresses Brooke Burke-Charvet and Kelly Brook. For the Skechers Performance Division, we also had Olympians Meb Keflezighi, Kara Goucher, and Matt Kuchar; and professional golfers Ashlan Ramsey, Belen Mozo, Brooke Henderson, Russell Knox, Wesley Bryan, Billy Andrade, Colin Montgomerie and Edward Cheserek, who won 17 National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”) distance running titles.
 Since 1992, when we introduced our first line, Skechers USA Sport Utility Footwear, we have expanded our product offering and grown our net sales while substantially increasing the breadth and penetration of our account base. Our men’s, women’s and children’s product lines benefit from the Skechers reputation for styling, quality, comfort, innovation and affordability. Our performance lines benefit from our marketing, product development, manufacturing support, and management expertise. To promote innovation and brand relevance, we manage our product lines separately by utilizing dedicated sales and design teams. Our product lines share back office services in order to limit our operating expenses and fully utilize our management’s vast experience in the footwear industry.
SKECHERS LINES
 We offer a wide array of Skechers-branded footwear lines for men, women and children, many of which have categories that have developed into well-known names. Most of these categories are marketed and packaged with unique shoe boxes, hangtags and in-store support, and are generally sold through department stores, footwear specialty stores, athletic retailers, Skechers retail stores as well as skechers.com and numerous online accounts. Management evaluates segment performance based primarily on net sales and gross margins; however, sales and costs are not allocated to specific product lines.

This helped more than 583,000 shelter pets in the United States, including saving the lives of more than 241,000 animals. Skechers also continues to donate new shoes to children in need through the BOBS program for which more than 15.6 million pairs of new kids’ shoes have been donated, including approximately 395,000 pairs in 2018.  The charitable shoes are primarily donated to charity partner Delivering Good, which then donates the shoes to various reputable charity organizations in the United States and around the world.

 Skechers Kids lines include shoes that are designed as “takedowns” of their adult counterparts, allowing the younger consumers the opportunity to wear the same popular styles as their older siblings and schoolmates. This “takedown” strategy maintains the product’s integrity by offering premium leathers, hardware and outsoles without the costs involved in designing and developing new products. In addition, we adapt current fashions from our men’s and women’s lines by modifying designs and choosing colors and materials that are more suitable for the playful image that we have established in the children’s footwear market. Each Skechers Kids line is marketed and packaged separately with a distinct shoe box.

The Skechers Work line incorporates design elements from other Skechers men’s and women’s lines. The uppers are comprised of high-quality leather, nubuck, trubuck and durabuck.

PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
 Our principal goal in product design is to generate fresh and innovative footwear in all of our product lines. Targeted to the active, youthful and style-savvy, we design our lifestyle line to be comfortable, fashionable and marketable to the 12- to 24-year-old consumer, with broader appeal to 5- to 50-year olds, and an exclusive selection for infants and toddlers. Designed by the Skechers Performance Division, our performance products are for professional and recreational athletes who want a technical fitness shoe. 
 We believe that our products’ success is related to our ability to recognize trends in the footwear markets and to design products that anticipate and accommodate consumers’ ever-evolving preferences. We are able to quickly translate the latest fashion trends into stylish, quality footwear at a reasonable price by analyzing and interpreting current and emerging lifestyle trends. Lifestyle trend information is compiled and analyzed by our designers in various ways, including reviewing and analyzing pop culture, clothing, and trend-setting media; traveling to domestic and international fashion markets to identify and confirm current trends; consulting with our retail and e-commerce customers for information on current retail selling trends; participating in major footwear trade shows to stay abreast of popular brands, fashions and styles; and subscribing to various fashion and color information services. In addition, a key component of our design philosophy is to continually reinterpret and develop our successful styles in our brands’ images.
 The footwear design process typically begins about nine months before the start of a season. Our products are designed and developed primarily by our in-house design staff. To promote innovation and brand relevance, we utilize dedicated design teams, who report to our senior design executives and focus on each of the men’s, women’s and children’s categories. In addition, we utilize outside design firms on an item-specific basis to supplement our internal design efforts. The design process is extremely collaborative, as members of the design staff frequently meet with the heads of retail, merchandising, sales, production and sourcing to further refine our products to meet the particular needs of the target market.
 After a design team arrives at a consensus regarding the fashion themes for the coming season, the designers then translate these themes into our products. These interpretations include variations in product color, material structure and embellishments, which are arrived at after close consultation with our production department. Prototype blueprints and specifications are created and forwarded to our manufacturers for design prototypes. The design prototypes are then sent back to our design teams. Our major retail customers may also review these new design concepts. Customer input not only allows us to measure consumer reaction to the latest designs, but also affords us an opportunity to foster deeper and more collaborative relationships with our customers. We also occasionally order limited production runs that may initially be tested in our concept stores with our test and react program, which gives us further insight into the strength of particular styles and allow our design teams to quickly modify and refine our designs. Generally, the production process can take six to nine months from design concept to commercialization.
 For disclosure of product design and development costs during the last three fiscal years, see Note 1 - The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report.
 SOURCING
 Factories. Our products are produced by independent contract manufacturers located primarily in China and Vietnam. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We believe that the use of independent manufacturers substantially increases our production flexibility and capacity, while reducing capital expenditures and avoiding the costs of managing a large production work force. For disclosure of information regarding the risks associated with having our manufacturing operations abroad and relying on independent contract manufacturers, see the relevant risk factors under Item 1A of this annual report.
 When possible, we seek to use manufacturers that have previously produced our footwear, which we believe enhances continuity and quality while controlling production costs. We source product for styles that account for a significant percentage of our net sales from at least five different manufacturers. During 2018, five of our contract manufacturers accounted for approximately 41.9% of total purchases. One manufacturer accounted for 12.8%, and another accounted for 10.1% of our total purchases. To date, we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining manufacturing services or with the availability of raw materials.
 We finance our production activities in part through the use of interest-bearing open purchase arrangements with certain of our contract manufacturers. These facilities currently bear interest at a rate between 0.0% and 0.5% for 30- to 60-day financing, depending on the factory. We believe that the use of these arrangements affords us additional liquidity and flexibility. We do not have any long-term contracts with any of our manufacturers. However, we have long-standing relationships with many of our contract manufacturers and believe our relationships to be good.
 6


We closely monitor sales activity after initial introduction of a product in our concept stores to determine whether there is substantial demand for a style, thereby aiding us in our sourcing decisions. Styles that have substantial consumer appeal are highlighted in upcoming collections or offered as part of our periodic style offerings, while less popular styles can be discontinued after a limited production run. We believe that sales in our concept stores can also help forecast sales in national retail stores, and we share this sales information with our wholesale customers. Sales, merchandising, production and allocations management analyze historical and current sales, and market data from our wholesale account base and our own retail stores to develop an internal product quantity forecast that allows us to better manage our future production and inventory levels. For those styles with high sell-through percentages, we maintain an in-stock position to minimize the time necessary to fill customer orders by placing orders with our manufacturers prior to the time we receive customers’ orders for such footwear. 
 Production Oversight. To safeguard product quality and consistency, we oversee the key aspects of production from initial prototype manufacture, through initial production runs, to final manufacture. Monitoring of all production is performed in the United States by our in-house production department and in Asia through a 343-person staff working from our offices in China and Vietnam. We believe that our Asian presence allows us to negotiate supplier and manufacturer arrangements more effectively, decrease product turnaround time, and ensure timely delivery of finished footwear. In addition, we require our manufacturers to certify that neither convicted, forced nor indentured labor (as defined under U.S. law), nor child labor (as defined by law in the manufacturer’s country) is used in the production process, that compensation will be paid according to local law, and that the factory is in compliance with local safety regulations.
 Quality Control. We believe that quality control is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products. Our quality control program is designed to ensure that not only finished goods meet our established design specifications, but also that all goods bearing our trademarks meet our standards for quality. Our quality control personnel located in China and Vietnam perform an array of inspection procedures at various stages of the production process, including examination and testing of prototypes of key raw materials prior to manufacture, samples and materials at various stages of production and final products prior to shipment. Our employees are on-site at each of our major manufacturers to oversee production. For some of our lower volume manufacturers, our staff is on-site during significant production runs, or we will perform unannounced visits to their manufacturing sites to further monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications.
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
 With a marketing philosophy of “Unseen, Untold, Unsold,” we take a targeted approach to marketing to drive traffic, build brand recognition and properly position our diverse lines within the marketplace. Senior management is directly involved in shaping our image and the conception, development and implementation of our advertising and marketing activities. Our marketing plan has a multi-pronged approach: traditional print and television advertising, supported by digital, outdoor, trend-influenced marketing, public relations, social media, promotions, events and in-store. In addition, we utilize celebrity endorsers in some of our advertisements. We also believe our websites and trade shows are effective marketing tools to both consumers and wholesale accounts. We have historically budgeted advertising as a percentage of projected net sales. 
 The majority of our advertising is conceptualized by our in-house design team. We believe that our advertising strategies, methods and creative campaigns are directly related to our success. We generally seek to build and drive brand awareness, create purchase intent and inform the consumer about new innovations and lines. Our campaigns are designed to provide merchandise flexibility and to facilitate the brand’s direction. 
 To further build brand awareness and influence consumer spending, we have selectively signed endorsement agreements with celebrities whom we believe will reach new markets. In 2018, our Skechers lifestyle endorsees included Camila Cabello, Brooke Burke-Charvet, Kelly Brook, Sugar Ray Leonard, Howie Long, David Ortiz, and Tony Romo. Our Skechers Performance Division 2018 endorsees included elite runner and Olympic medalist Meb Kelfezighi, elite runners Kara Goucher and Edward Cheserek, and professional golfers Matt Kuchar, Belen Mozo, Brooke Henderson, Ashlan Ramsey, Billy Andrade, Russell Knox, Wesley Bryan and Colin Montgomerie. Additionally, several international markets signed local ambassadors for marketing campaigns. Along with these global ambassadors, we also had local or regional ambassadors including pop groups for numerous countries in Asia.  From time to time, we may sign other celebrities to endorse our brand name and image in order to strategically market our products among specific consumer groups in the future.
 With a targeted approach, our print ads appear in popular fashion, lifestyle and pop culture publications in the United States and around the world.
 Our television commercials are produced both in-house and through producers that we have utilized in the past who are familiar with our brands. In 2018, we developed commercials for men, women and children for our Skechers brands, including our animated spots for kids featuring our own action heroes, as well as live action commercials that appeal to older kids and tweens. We also had commercials for our golf collection lines that featured our elite golfers, and for our lifestyle lines that feature musicians, actors and retired athletes. We have found these to be cost-effective ways to advertise on key national and cable programming during high-selling seasons. In 2018, many of our television commercials were translated into multiple languages and aired in numerous markets around the world. Further, select markets have created television commercials specific to their market with local celebrities.

Outdoor. In an effort to reach consumers where they shop and in high-traffic areas as they travel to and from work, at times we execute outdoor campaigns that may include mall and telephone kiosks, billboards, transportation systems and airports, and the covering of large stadiums and buildings around the world. In many markets these now include LED billboards that broadcast our commercials. In addition, we advertised on perimeter boards at soccer matches and professional sporting events in Japan, Europe, Latin America and Canada. We believe these mediums are an effective and efficient way to target specific consumers.
 Public Relations/Trend-Influenced Marketing. Our public relations objectives are to accurately position Skechers as a leading footwear brand within the business, general news and trade publications as well as to secure product placement in key magazines and television shows, and place our footwear on the feet of trend-setting influencers, celebrities and their families. We have been featured in leading business publications with interviews of our executives discussing our business strategy and position within the footwear market. We have amassed an array of prominent product placements in leading fashion, lifestyle, sports and pop culture magazines and websites. Additionally, we have partnered with influencers, bloggers and vloggers who have both appeared at events and posted on their social media channels about our footwear.  
 Social Media. With the goal of engaging with consumers, showcasing our product in relatable settings and relaying the latest news, we have built communities on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube in the United States and in countries around the world where our product is sold. To promote both our lifestyle and performance brands, we have developed several unique channels under Skechers®, Skechers Performance™, BOBS from Skechers and Mark Nason. The social platforms are divided into Skechers and Skechers Performance sites, as well as a BOBS page to feature our charitable footwear line. The online communities also connect consumers around the world, allowing an easy glimpse into trends and events in other countries. Additionally, many countries also utilize platforms specific to their market, such as Line in Japan and Weibo in China.
 Promotions and Events. By applying creative sales techniques via a broad spectrum of media, our marketing team seeks to build brand recognition and drive traffic to Skechers retail stores, websites and our retail partners’ locations. Skechers’ promotional strategies have encompassed in-store specials, charity events, product tie-ins and giveaways and collaborations with national retailers and radio stations. In 2018, we appeared at walks and at numerous marathons in Boston, New York, London, Paris, Santiago and other cities with Skechers Performance branded booths to allow runners the ability to try on and often buy our products. In 2018, the Skechers Performance Division was the footwear and apparel sponsor for the Houston Marathon, the title sponsor of the Skechers Performance Los Angeles Marathon, and the footwear sponsor for Ironman across Europe. Our products were made available to consumers directly or through key accounts at many of these events. In addition, we partnered with key accounts by donating BOBS footwear to children in need at donation events in cities throughout the United States which built our relationships with these accounts as well as the local communities.  As part of our BOBS for Dogs charity program we also partnered with Best Friends Animal Society, an organization dedicated to saving the lives of dogs and cats, in Strut your Mutt Dog donation events across the country. 
 Visual Merchandising. Our in-house visual merchandising department supports wholesale customers, distributors and our retail stores by developing displays that effectively leverage our products at the point of sale. Our point-of-purchase display items include signage, graphics, displays, counter cards, banners and other merchandising items for each of our brands. These materials mirror the look and feel of each brand and reinforce the image, and draw consumers into stores.
 Our visual merchandising coordinators (“VMC’s”) work with our sales force and directly with our customers to ensure better sell-through at the retail level by generating greater consumer awareness through Skechers brand displays. Our VMC’s communicate with and visit our wholesale customers on a regular basis to aid in proper display of our merchandise. They also run in-store promotions to enhance the sale of Skechers footwear and create excitement surrounding the Skechers brand. We believe that these efforts help stimulate impulse sales and repeat purchases.
 Trade Shows. To showcase our diverse products to footwear buyers in the United States and Europe and to distributors around the world, we regularly exhibit at leading trade shows. Along with specialty trade shows, we exhibit at FFANY, The Licensing Show and Outdoor Retailer in the United States; MICAM, Gallery and ISPO in Europe; and other international shows. 
 Digital. In 2018, we launched marketing campaigns on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, and launched digital campaigns in many international markets to coincide with key selling time periods.  We promote and sell our products through our e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Chile and China, among other countries, as well as through non-ecommerce sites in many other countries. Our websites are a venue for dialog and feedback from customers about our products, which enhances the Skechers brand experience while driving sales through all our retail channels.

PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS 
 We have three reportable segments: domestic wholesale sales, international wholesale sales, and retail sales, which includes e-commerce sales. In the United States, our products are available through a network of wholesale customers comprised of department, athletic and specialty stores and online retailers. Internationally, our products are available through wholesale customers in more than 170 countries and territories via our global network of distributors, in addition to our subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, Canada, Central America and South America. Skechers owns and operates retail stores both domestically and internationally through three integrated retail formats—concept, factory outlet and warehouse outlet stores. Each of these channels serves an integral function in the global distribution of our products. In addition, 18 distributors and 48 licensees have opened and operate 700 distributor-owned or -licensed Skechers retail stores and 1,813 licensee-owned Skechers retail stores, respectively, in over 170 countries as of December 31, 2018.
 Domestic Wholesale. We distribute our footwear through the following domestic wholesale distribution channels: department stores, specialty stores, athletic specialty shoe stores, independent retailers, and internet retailers. While department stores and specialty retailers are the largest distribution channels, we believe that we appeal to a variety of wholesale customers, many of whom may operate stores within the same retail location due to our distinct product lines, variety of styles and the price criteria of their specific customers. Management has a clearly defined growth strategy for each of our channels of distribution. An integral component of our strategy is to offer our accounts the highest level of customer service so that our products will be fully represented in existing and new customer retail locations.
 In an effort to provide knowledgeable and personalized service to our wholesale customers, the sales force is segregated by product line, each of which is headed by a vice president or national sales manager. Reporting to each sales manager are knowledgeable account executives and territory managers. The vice presidents and national sales managers report to our senior vice president of sales. All of our vice presidents and national sales managers are compensated on a salary basis, while our account executives and territory managers are compensated on a commission basis. None of our domestic sales personnel sells competing products.
 We believe that we have developed a loyal account base through exceptional customer service. We believe that our close relationships with these accounts help us to maximize their retail sell-through. Our marketing teams work with our wholesale customers to ensure that our merchandise and marketing materials are properly presented. Sales executives and merchandise personnel work closely with accounts to ensure that appropriate styles are purchased for specific accounts and for specific stores within those accounts, as well as to ensure that appropriate inventory levels are carried at each store. Such information is then utilized to help develop sales projections and determine the product needs of our wholesale customers. The value-added services we provide our wholesale customers help us maintain strong relationships with our existing wholesale customers and attract potential new wholesale customers.
 Retail stores and e-commerce. We pursue our retail store strategy through our three integrated retail formats: concept stores, factory outlet stores and warehouse outlet stores. Our three store formats enable us to promote the full Skechers product offering in an attractive environment that appeals to a broad group of consumers. In addition, most of our retail stores are profitable and have a positive effect on our operating results. We review all of our stores for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances require it. We prepare a summary of cash flows for each of our retail stores to assess potential impairment of the fixed assets and leasehold improvements. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. In addition, we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us. As of February 1, 2019, we owned and operated 113 concept stores, 170 factory outlet stores and 187 warehouse outlet stores in the United States, and 134 concept stores, 78 factory outlet stores, and 10 warehouse outlet stores internationally. We plan to open 70 to 80 new stores in 2019.
 Our retail stores are supported by our company-owned ecommerce businesses in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Chile and China, among other countries. These virtual storefronts are designed to provide a positive shopping and brand experience, showcasing our products in an easy-to-navigate format, allowing consumers to browse our selections and purchase our footwear. These virtual stores provide a convenient, alternative shopping environment and brand experience, and are an additional efficient and effective retail distribution channel, which has improved our customer service. They enable consumers to shop, browse, find store locations, socially interact, post a shoe review, photo, video or question, and immerse themselves in our brands.

• | Concept Stores
--+---------------

 Our concept stores are located at marquee street locations, major tourist areas or in key shopping malls in metropolitan cities. Our concept stores have a threefold purpose in our operating strategy. First, concept stores serve as a showcase for a wide range of our product offering for the current season, as we estimate that our average wholesale customer carries no more than 5% of the complete Skechers line in any one location. Our concept stores showcase our products in an attractive, easy-to-shop open-floor setting, providing the customer with the complete Skechers story. Second, retail locations are generally chosen to generate maximum marketing value for the Skechers brand name through signage, store front presentation and interior design. Domestic locations include concept stores at Times Square, 5th Avenue, SOHO, and 34th Street, in New York; Powell Street in San Francisco: Santa Monica’s Third Street Promenade; Ala Moana Center in Hawaii; South Beach Miami’s Lincoln Road and Las Vegas’ Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian. International locations include Oxford Street and Covent Garden in London; Buchanan Street in Glasgow; Princes Street in Edinburgh; Toronto’s Eaton Centre; Vancouver’s Pacific Centre; the Shinsaibashi shopping district of Osaka and Harajuku and Shibuya in Tokyo. The stores are typically designed to create a distinctive Skechers look and feel, and enhance customer association of the Skechers brand name with current youthful lifestyle trends and styles. Third, the concept stores serve as marketing and product testing venues. We believe that product sell-through information and rapid customer feedback derived from our concept stores enables our design, sales, merchandising and production staff to respond to market changes and new product introductions. Such responses serve to augment sales and limit our inventory markdowns and customer returns and allowances.
 The typical Skechers concept store is approximately 3,000 square feet, although in certain markets we have opened concept stores as large as 8,000 square feet or as small as 800 square feet. When deciding where to open concept stores, we identify top geographic markets in the larger metropolitan cities in North America, Europe, Central America, South America and Asia. When selecting a specific site, we evaluate the proposed sites’ traffic pattern, co-tenancies, sales volume of neighboring concept stores, lease economics and other factors considered important within the specific location. If we are considering opening a concept store in a shopping mall, our strategy is to obtain space as centrally located as possible in the mall, where we expect foot traffic to be most concentrated. We believe that the strength of the Skechers brand name has enabled us to negotiate more favorable terms with shopping malls that want us to open up concept stores to attract customer traffic to their venues.
  
• | Factory Outlet Stores
--+----------------------

 Our factory outlet stores are generally located in manufacturers’ direct outlet centers in the United States and in select international markets. Our factory outlet stores provide opportunities for us to sell discontinued and excess merchandise, thereby reducing the need to sell such merchandise to discounters at excessively low prices and potentially compromise the Skechers brand image. Skechers’ factory outlet stores range in size from approximately 1,800 to 24,100 square feet. Unlike our warehouse outlet stores, inventory in these stores is supplemented by certain first-line styles sold at full retail price points. 
  
• | Warehouse Outlet Stores
--+------------------------

 Our free-standing and inline warehouse outlet stores, which are primarily located throughout the United States and Canada, enable us to liquidate excess merchandise, discontinued lines and odd-size inventory in a cost-efficient manner. Skechers’ warehouse outlet stores are typically larger than our factory outlet stores and typically range in size from approximately 4,000 to 30,600 square feet. Our warehouse outlet stores enable us to sell discontinued and excess merchandise that would otherwise typically be sold to discounters at excessively low prices, which could otherwise compromise the Skechers brand image. We seek to open our warehouse outlet stores in areas that are in close proximity to our concept stores to facilitate the timely transfer of inventory that we want to liquidate as soon as practicable.

International Wholesale. Our products are sold in more than 170 countries and territories throughout the world. We generate revenues from outside the United States from three principal sources: (i) direct sales to department stores and specialty retail stores through our joint ventures in Asia and the Middle East, as well as through our subsidiaries in the Americas, Europe, and Japan; (ii) sales to foreign distributors who distribute our footwear to department stores and specialty retail stores in select countries and territories across Asia, South America, Africa, the Middle East and Australia; and (iii) to a lesser extent, royalties from licensees who manufacture and distribute our non-footwear products outside the United States.
 We believe that international distribution of our products represents a significant opportunity to increase net sales and profits. We intend to further increase our share of the international footwear market by heightening our marketing in those countries in which we currently have a presence through our international advertising campaigns, which are designed to establish Skechers as a global brand synonymous with trend-right casual shoes.

•Distributors and Licensees
 Where we do not sell directly through our international subsidiaries and joint ventures, our footwear is distributed through an extensive network of more than 22 distributors who sell our products to department, athletic and specialty stores. As of December 31, 2018, we also had agreements with 18 of these distributors and 48 licensees regarding 700 distributor-owned or licensed Skechers retail stores and 1,813 licensee-owned Skechers retail stores, respectively. Our distributors, licensees and franchisees own and operate the following retail stores in more than 170 countries around the world:

 | Number of Store Locations December 31, 2017 | | Opened during 2018 | | Closed during 2018 | Number of Store Locations December 31, 2018 |

Distributors and licensees are responsible for their respective stores’ operations, have ownership of their respective stores’ assets, and select the broad collection of our products to sell to consumers in their regions. In order to maintain a globally consistent image, we provide architectural, graphic and visual guidance and materials for the design of the stores, and we train the local staff on our products and corporate culture. We intend to expand our international presence and global recognition of the Skechers brand name by continuing to sell our footwear to foreign distributors and by opening retail stores with distributors that have local market expertise.
 For disclosure of financial information about geographic areas and segment information for our three reportable segments–domestic wholesale sales, international wholesale sales, and retail sales, see Note 19 – Segment and Geographic Reporting in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report.
 LICENSING
 We believe that selective licensing of the Skechers brand name and our product line names to manufacturers may broaden and enhance the individual brands without requiring significant capital investments or additional incremental operating expenses. Our multiple product lines plus additional subcategories present many potential licensing opportunities on terms with licensees that we believe will provide more effective manufacturing, distribution or marketing of non-footwear products. We also believe that the reputation of Skechers and its history in launching brands has also enabled us to partner with reputable non-footwear brands to design and market their footwear.
 As of February 1, 2019, we had 22 active domestic and international licensing agreements in which we are the licensor. These include Skechers-branded kids’ apparel; bags, backpacks and lunch boxes; belts, wallets and watches; headwear, socks and shoe care; prescription and sunglass eyewear; outerwear, swimwear, underwear, sleepwear and medical scrubs; fitness, yoga and running accessories; consumer electronics; bicycles and safety gear and cold weather products. Additional category-specific collections include Skechers Sport apparel, bags, backpacks and headwear; Twinkle Toes backpacks, lunchboxes, do-it-yourself fashion kits, sunglasses and hair accessories; and Skechers Work socks. We also have BOBS for DOGS pet accessories in Petco. We have international licensing agreements for the design and distribution of men’s, women’s and kids’ apparel in the United Kingdom; socks throughout Europe; bags and backpacks in the Philippines, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the Middle East; apparel, socks, headwear, bags, backpacks in Indonesia; apparel, socks, bags in Mexico; bags, backpacks, luggage, wallets, apparel, watches, medical scrubs and accessories in Latin America; and watches in the Philippines.

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
 We believe that strong distribution support is a critical factor in our operations. Once manufactured, our products are packaged in shoe boxes bearing bar codes that are shipped either: (i) to our approximate 1.8 million square-foot distribution center located in Rancho Belago, California, (ii) to our approximate 1.3 million square-foot European Distribution Center (“EDC”) located in Liege, Belgium, (iii) to our company-operated distribution centers or third-party distribution centers in Central America, South America and Asia or (vi) directly from third-party manufacturers to our other international customers and other international third-party distribution centers. Upon receipt at either of the distribution centers, merchandise is inspected and recorded in our management information system and packaged according to customers’ orders for delivery. Merchandise is shipped to customers by whatever means each customer requests, which is usually by common carrier. The distribution centers have multi-access docks, enabling us to receive and ship simultaneously, and to pack separate trailers for shipments to different customers at the same time. We have an electronic data interchange system (“EDI system”) which is linked to some of our larger customers. This system allows these customers to automatically place orders with us, thereby eliminating the time involved in transmitting and inputting orders, and it includes direct billing and shipping information.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 We own and utilize a variety of trademarks, including the Skechers trademark. We have a significant number of both registrations and pending applications for our trademarks in the United States. In addition, we have trademark registrations and trademark applications in approximately 139 foreign countries. We also have design patents and pending design and utility patent applications in both the United States and approximately 21 foreign countries. We continuously look to increase the number of our patents and trademarks both domestically and internationally, where necessary to protect valuable intellectual property. We regard our trademarks and other intellectual property as valuable assets, and believe that they have significant value in marketing our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, including through the use of cease and desist letters, administrative proceedings and lawsuits.
 We rely on trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, non-disclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish, protect and enforce intellectual property rights in our logos, trade names and in the design of our products. In particular, we believe that our future success will largely depend on our ability to maintain and protect the Skechers trademark and other key trademarks. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our intellectual property rights, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in this regard. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that our trademarks, products and promotional materials or other intellectual property rights do not, or will not, violate the intellectual property rights of others, that our intellectual property would be upheld if challenged, or that we would, in such an event, not be prevented from using our trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Such claims, if proven, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, although any such claims may ultimately prove to be without merit, the necessary management attention and associated legal costs with litigation or other resolution of future claims concerning trademarks and other intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have sued and have been sued by third parties for infringement of intellectual property. It is our opinion that none of these claims filed against us has materially impaired our ability to utilize our intellectual property rights.
 The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent, or in the same manner, as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to implement protective measures and intend to defend our intellectual property rights vigorously, these efforts may not be successful, or the costs associated with protecting our rights in certain jurisdictions may be prohibitive. From time to time, we discover products in the marketplace that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe upon intellectual property rights held by us. Actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others, or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violating trademarks and intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of such products by that or any other third party could adversely impact the Skechers brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products, and generally have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 COMPETITION
 The global footwear industry is a competitive business. Although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company with respect to its entire range of products, our products compete with other branded products within their product category as well as with private label products sold by retailers, including some of our customers. Our casual shoes and utility footwear compete with footwear offered by companies such as Columbia Sportswear Company, Converse by Nike, Inc., Deckers Outdoor Corporation, Kenneth Cole Productions Inc., Steven Madden, Ltd., The Timberland Company, V.F. Corporation and Wolverine World Wide, Inc. Our athletic lifestyle and performance shoes compete with footwear offered by companies such as Nike, Inc., adidas AG, Reebok International Ltd., Puma SE, ASICS America Corporation, New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. and Under Armour, Inc. The 
 14


intense competition among these companies and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for performance footwear, including the walking fitness category, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. Our children’s shoes compete with footwear offered by these companies and with other brands such as Stride Rite by Wolverine World Wide, Inc. In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of style, price, quality, comfort and brand name prestige and recognition, among other factors. These and other competitors pose challenges to our market share in domestic and international markets. We also compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of footwear for the limited shelf space available for displaying such products to the consumer. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing capacity allows ease of access by new market entrants. Some of our competitors are larger, have been in existence for a longer period of time, have strong brand recognition, have captured greater market share and/or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 EMPLOYEES
 As of January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 12,600 persons, of whom approximately 5,400 were employed on a full-time basis and approximately 7,200 were employed on a part-time basis, primarily in our retail stores. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
