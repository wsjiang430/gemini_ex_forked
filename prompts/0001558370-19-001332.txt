ITEM 1.BUSINESS
     ArcBest Corporation
     ArcBest CorporationTM (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is a leading logistics company with creative problem solvers who deliver integrated solutions. Our mission is to connect and positively impact the world through solving logistics challenges. 
     In 2018, ArcBest® celebrated its 95th anniversary. From its roots in less-than-truckload (“LTL”) delivery, ArcBest has transformed into a full-scale provider of end-to-end supply chain services. Under the ArcBest brand, we offer customized logistics solutions to optimize our customers’ supply chains, while we continue to offer a full array of asset-based LTL services through the ABF Freight® network and ground expedite services under the Panther Premium Logistics® brand. Our service offerings also include truckload, intermodal, international air and ocean, time critical, managed transportation, warehousing and distribution, household goods moving services under the U‑Pack® brand, and commercial vehicle maintenance and repair from FleetNet America®. With a comprehensive suite of freight transportation and logistics services and employees who have The Skill and The Will® to get the job done, ArcBest has the unique ability to address even the most complex logistics and supply chain challenges that our customers face every day.
     Our operations are conducted through our three reportable operating segments, which are described in the Business Description Section below:

· | Asset-Based, which represents ABF Freight System, Inc. and certain other subsidiaries, including ABF Freight System (B.C.), Ltd.; ABF Freight System Canada, Ltd.; ABF Cartage, Inc.; and Land-Marine Cargo, Inc. (collectively “ABF Freight”);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ArcBest, our asset-light logistics operation; and

· | FleetNet.
--+----------

      The ArcBest and FleetNet reportable segments, combined, represent our Asset-Light operations.
     Vision and Values
     “We’ll Find a Way” is the vision of ArcBest. It is a testament of what our customers say about us – that we’re the kind of company who partners with them to solve problems and make things happen. It speaks to the can-do attitude and will of our people to do the hard things well. 
     We carry out our vision by exemplifying our corporate values:

· | Creativity – We create solutions.
--+----------------------------------


· | Integrity – We do the right thing.
--+-----------------------------------


· | Collaboration – We work together.
--+----------------------------------


· | Growth – We grow our people and our business.
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Excellence – We exceed expectations.
--+-------------------------------------


· | Wellness – We embrace total health.
--+------------------------------------

      Strategy
     Our strategy is to produce long-term value with our creative problem solvers by building informed, trusted, and innovative relationships with shippers and capacity providers and delivering a best-in-class experience efficiently through their desired channels. 
     We work to build long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by:

· | Expanding our revenue opportunities. We seek to expand our revenue opportunities through deepening our existing customer relationships and securing new ones. We build relationships that last for decades and our customers assign a high degree of value for the high level of service and professionalism we provide. When customers talk about us, they say that we solve their logistics and transportation challenges, we are a trusted provider and partner who understands them, and we make it easy to do business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Balancing our revenue and profit mix. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition with our ability to offer logistics solutions with a wide variety of fulfillment options, which can include our own assets. As our Asset-Light operations continue to grow alongside our Asset-Based services, we are balancing the mix of our revenue and profit between our Asset-Based segment and our Asset-Light operations. This balance drives long-term financial sustainability by making our business less capital-intensive relative to its size, and by reducing volatility in our business performance through varying cycles, events, and/or environments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Optimizing our cost structure. We are focused on profitable growth, which causes us to continually review our costs and investment decisions accordingly. Our technology infrastructure enables business processes, insight and analytics that allow us to optimize our cost structure, and we continue to invest in technology to transform our business. We seek to improve the customer experience while simultaneously driving improved cost efficiency in our business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We continually analyze where additional capital should be invested and where management resources should be focused to improve relationships with customers and meet their expanding needs. In response to customers’ needs for expanded service offerings, we have strategically increased investment in our Asset-Light operations. The additional resources invested in growing our Asset-Light operations help ensure we are positioned to serve the changing marketplace and capitalize on available opportunity by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services. As part of this strategy, we have completed the following acquisitions and changes to our business model:

· | On June 15, 2012, we acquired Panther Expedited Services, Inc. (“Panther”), one of North America’s largest providers of expedited freight transportation services with expanding service offerings in premium freight logistics and freight forwarding. Our expedite and premium logistics operations are reported in the ArcBest segment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Effective July 1, 2013, we formed the segment previously reported as ABF Logistics in a strategic alignment of the sales and operations functions of our logistics businesses.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On April 30, 2014, we acquired a small privately-owned business which is reported within the FleetNet segment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | During 2014, we established our enterprise solutions group to offer more easily accessible transportation and logistics solutions for our customers through a single point of contact.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On January 2, 2015, we acquired Smart Lines Transportation Group, LLC (“Smart Lines”), a privately-owned truckload brokerage operation that became part of the ArcBest segment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On December 1, 2015, we acquired Bear Transportation Services, L.P. (“Bear”), a privately-owned truckload brokerage operation that became part of the ArcBest segment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On September 2, 2016, we acquired Logistics & Distribution Services, LLC (“LDS”), a privately-owned logistics and distribution firm with a focus on asset-light dedicated truckload business reported in the ArcBest segment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On January 1, 2017, we introduced our enhanced market approach under the ArcBest brand and realigned our company’s structure – unifying our sales, pricing, customer service, marketing, and capacity sourcing functions to better serve our customers through delivery of integrated logistics solutions.

 Asset-Based Segment
 Our Asset-Based segment provides LTL services through ABF Freight’s motor carrier operations. Asset-Based revenues accounted for approximately 69% of our total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 4% of revenues in the Asset-Based segment, and the segment’s 10 largest customers, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 13% of its revenues. Note M to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains additional segment financial information, including revenues and operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
     Our Asset-Based carrier, ABF Freight, has been in continuous service since 1923. ABF Freight System, Inc. is the successor to Arkansas Motor Freight, a business originally organized in 1935 which was the successor to a local transfer and storage carrier that was originally organized in 1923. ABF Freight expanded operations through several strategic acquisitions and organic growth and is now one of the largest LTL motor carriers in North America, providing direct service to more than 98% of U.S. cities having a population of 30,000 or more. ABF Freight offers interstate and intrastate service to approximately 52,000 communities through 245 service centers in all 50 states, Canada, and Puerto Rico. ABF Freight also provides motor carrier freight transportation services to customers in Mexico through arrangements with trucking companies in that country.
     Our Asset-Based operations offer transportation of general commodities through standard, time-critical, and guaranteed LTL services — both nationally and regionally. General commodities include all freight except hazardous waste, dangerous explosives, commodities of exceptionally high value, commodities in bulk, and those requiring special equipment. Shipments of general commodities differ from shipments of bulk raw materials, which are commonly transported by railroad, truckload tank car, pipeline, and water carrier. General commodities transported by our Asset-Based operations include, among other things, food, textiles, apparel, furniture, appliances, chemicals, nonbulk petroleum products, rubber, plastics, metal and metal products, wood, glass, automotive parts, machinery, and miscellaneous manufactured products.
     Our Asset-Based operations transport a wide variety of large and small shipments to geographically dispersed destinations. Typically, LTL shipments are picked up at customers’ places of business and consolidated at a local service center. Shipments are consolidated by destination for transportation by intercity units to their destination cities or to distribution centers. At distribution centers, shipments from various service centers can be reconsolidated for other distribution centers or, more typically, local service centers. After arriving at a local service center, a shipment is delivered to the customer by local trucks operating from the service center. In some cases, when one large shipment or a sufficient number of different shipments at one origin service center are going to a common destination, they can be combined to make a full trailer load. A trailer is then dispatched to that destination without rehandling. The LTL transportation industry, which requires networks of local pickup and delivery service centers combined with larger distribution facilities, is significantly more infrastructure-intensive than truckload operations and, as such, has higher barriers to entry. Costs associated with an expansive LTL network, including investments in or costs associated with real estate and labor costs related to local pickup, delivery, and cross-docking of shipments, are to a large extent fixed in nature unless service levels are significantly changed.
     Our Asset-Based operations offer regional service alongside ABF Freight’s traditional long-haul model to facilitate our customers’ next-day and second-day delivery needs in most areas throughout the United States. Development and expansion of ABF Freight’s regional network includes strategically positioned freight exchange points, and increased door capacity at a number of key locations. Regional service offerings have resulted in reduced transit times and allows for consistent and continuous LTL service. We define our Asset-Based regional market, which represented approximately 60% of its tonnage in 2018, as tonnage moving 1,000 miles or less.
     Labor costs, which amounted to 51.9% of Asset-Based revenues for 2018, are the largest component of the segment’s operating expenses. As of December 2018, approximately 82% of the Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under a collective bargaining agreement, the ABF National Master Freight Agreement (the “2018 ABF NMFA”), with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the “IBT”), which was ratified on May 10, 2018 by a majority of ABF’s IBT member employees who voted. A majority of the supplements to the 2018 ABF NMFA also passed. Following ratification of the remaining supplements, the 2018 ABF NMFA was implemented on July 29, 2018, effective retroactive to April 1, 2018, and will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. The major economic provisions of the 2018 ABF NMFA include restoration of one week of vacation that was previously reduced in the prior collective bargaining agreement, which begins accruing on anniversary dates on or after April 1, 2018, with the new vacation eligibility schedule being the same as the 

 
  6

 
applicable 2008 to 2013 supplemental agreements; wage rate increases in each year of the contract, beginning July 1, 2018; ratification bonuses for qualifying employees; profit-sharing bonuses upon the Asset-Based segment’s achievement of certain annual operating ratios for any full calendar year under the contract; and changes to purchased transportation provisions with certain protections for road drivers as specified in the contract. The 2018 ABF NMFA and the related supplemental agreements provide for contributions to multiemployer pension plans frozen at the current rates for each fund, continuation of existing health coverage, and annual contribution rate increases to multiemployer health and welfare plans maintained for the benefit of ABF's employees who are members of the IBT. Under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the contractual wage and benefits costs, including the ratification bonuses and vacation restoration, are estimated to increase approximately 2.0% on a compounded annual basis through the end of the agreement. Profit-sharing bonuses based on the Asset-Based segment’s annual operating ratios for any full calendar year under the contract would represent an additional increase in costs under the 2018 ABF NMFA.
     Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), pursuant to the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (the “MPPA Act”), substantially expanded the potential liabilities of employers who participate in multiemployer pension plans. Under ERISA, as amended by the MPPA Act, an employer who contributes to a multiemployer pension plan and the members of such employer’s controlled group are jointly and severally liable for their share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits in the event the employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or substantially reduces its contributions to the plan (i.e., in the event of a complete or partial withdrawal from the multiemployer plans). The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (the “Reform Act”), which was included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 (the “CFCAA”) that was signed into law on December 16, 2014, includes provisions to address the funding of multiemployer pension plans in critical and declining status. Provisions of the Reform Act include, among others, providing qualifying plans the ability to self-correct funding issues, subject to various requirements and restrictions, including applying to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury Department”) for the reduction of certain accrued benefits. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension plan contribution obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. However, we cannot determine with any certainty the contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements for ABF Freight’s contractual employees. See Note I to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more specific disclosures regarding the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes.
     ABF Freight operates in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion motor carriers. Nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure and less stringent labor work rules, and certain carriers also have lower wage rates for their freight-handling and driving personnel. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors also allow for a lower cost structure. ABF Freight has continued to address with the IBT the effect of the wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results. The combined effect under the contractual labor agreement in place prior to the 2018 ABF NMFA of cost reductions, lowered cost increases throughout the contract period, and increased flexibility in labor work rules were important factors in bringing ABF Freight’s labor cost structure closer in line with that of its competitors; however, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry. These rates include contributions to multiemployer plans, a portion of which are used to fund benefits for individuals who were never employed by ABF Freight. Information provided by a large multiemployer pension plan to which ABF Freight contributes indicates that approximately 50% of the plan’s benefit payments are made to retirees of companies that are no longer contributing employers to that plan. 
     Asset-Light Operations 
 The ArcBest and FleetNet reportable segments, combined, represent our Asset-Light operations. Our Asset-Light operations are a key component of our strategy to offer customers end-to-end logistics solutions, designed to satisfy the complex supply chain and unique shipping requirements they encounter. Through unique methods and processes, including technology solutions and the use of third-party service providers, our Asset-Light operations provide various logistics and maintenance services without significant investment in revenue equipment or real estate.
     For the year ended December 31, 2018, the combined revenues of our Asset-Light operations accounted for approximately 31% of our total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no single customer accounted for more than 4% of the ArcBest segment’s revenues, and the segment’s 10 largest customers, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 20% of its revenues. Note M to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains additional segment financial information, including revenues and operating income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.

 ArcBest Segment
 As previously discussed in “Strategy” within this Business section, our ArcBest segment originated with the formation of ABF Logistics in July 2013, when we strategically aligned the sales and operations functions of our organically-developed logistics businesses. The ArcBest segment includes the ground expedite services of the Panther Premium Logistics brand; household goods moving services under the U-Pack brand, for which the majority of the moves are provided with our Asset-Based operations; and the acquired operations of Smart Lines, Bear, and LDS. Under our enhanced market approach to offer customers a single source of end-to-end logistics, the service offerings of the ArcBest segment continue to become more integrated. Management’s operating decisions have become more focused on the ArcBest segment’s combined operations, rather than individual service offerings within the segment’s operations. The ArcBest segment offers the following solutions:
     Expedite 
 Through the Panther Premium Logistics brand, we offer expedite freight transportation services to commercial and government customers and we offer premium logistics services that involve the rapid deployment of highly specialized equipment to meet extremely specific linehaul requirements, such as temperature control, hazardous materials, geofencing (routing a shipment across a mandatory, defined route with satellite monitoring and automated alerts concerning any deviation from the route), specialized government cargo, security services, and life sciences. Through these services, ArcBest solves the toughest shipping and logistics challenges that customers face through a global network of owner operators and contract carriers. 
     Substantially all of the network capacity for our expedite operations is provided by third-party carriers, including owner operators, ground linehaul providers, cartage agents, and other transportation asset providers, which are selected based on their ability to serve our customers effectively with respect to price, technology capabilities, geographic coverage, and quality of service. Third-party owned vehicles are driven by independent contract drivers and by drivers engaged directly by independent owners of multiple pieces of equipment, commonly referred to as fleet owners. Our expedite operations own a fleet of trailers, the communication devices used by its owner operators, and certain highly specialized equipment, primarily temperature-controlled and temperature-validated trailers, to meet the service requirements of certain customers.
     Truckload and Truckload-Dedicated
 Our truckload and truckload-dedicated services provide third-party transportation brokerage by sourcing a variety of capacity solutions, including dry van over the road, temperature-controlled and refrigerated, flatbed, intermodal or container shipping, and specialized equipment, coupled with strong technology and carrier- and customer-based Web tools. We offer a growing network of 26,000 vetted service providers, with services to 50 states, Canada, and Mexico. Additional value is created for customers through seamless access to the ABF Freight network.
     International 
 Our International services provide international ocean and air shipping solutions by partnering with ocean shipping lines and air freight carriers worldwide. As a non-vessel operating common carrier, we provide less-than-container load and full‑container load service, offering ocean transport to approximately 90% of the total ocean international market to and from the United States.      Managed Transportation
 We also provide freight transportation management services for customers. ArcBest seeks to offer value through identifying specific challenges relating to customers’ supply chain needs and providing customized solutions utilizing technology, both internally to manage its business processes and externally to provide shipment and inventory visibility to its customers. Additional value is created for customers through seamless access to the ABF Freight network, the Panther fleet, and other ArcBest capacity sources, offering strategic supply chain solutions with unique access to assured capacity.      Moving 
 Our moving services offer flexibility and convenience in the way people move through targeted service offerings for the “do-it-yourself” consumer and corporate account employee relocations. We offer these targeted services at competitive prices that reflect the additional value customers find in our convenient, reliable moving service offerings. Industry leading technology, customer-friendly interfaces, and supply chain solutions are combined to provide a wide range of options customized to meet unique customer needs.

 Other Logistics Services
 We also provide other services to meet our customers’ logistics needs, such as final mile, time critical, product launch, warehousing and distribution, retail logistics, supply chain optimization, and trade show shipping services.
     FleetNet Segment
 The FleetNet segment includes the results of operations of FleetNet America, Inc. (“FleetNet”), our subsidiary that provides roadside assistance and maintenance management services for commercial vehicles to customers in the United States and Canada through a network of third-party service providers. FleetNet began in 1953 as the internal breakdown department for Carolina Freight Carriers Corp. In 1993, the department was incorporated as Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. to allow the opportunity for other trucking companies to take advantage of the established nationwide service. In 1995, we purchased WorldWay Corporation, which operated various subsidiaries including Carolina Freight Carriers Corp. and Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. The name of Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. was changed to FleetNet America, Inc. in 1997.
     Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors
     Competition
 Our Asset-Based segment actively competes for freight business with other national, regional, and local motor carriers and, to a lesser extent, with private carriage, domestic and international freight forwarders, railroads, and airlines. The segment competes most directly with nonunion and union LTL carriers, including YRC Freight and YRC Regional (reporting segments of YRC Worldwide Inc.), FedEx Freight (included in the FedEx Freight reporting segment of FedEx Corporation), UPS Freight (included in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment of United Parcel Service, Inc.), Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., Saia, Inc., the LTL reporting segment of Roadrunner Transportation Systems, Inc., and the LTL operations of XPO Logistics, Inc. Competition is based primarily on price, service, and availability of flexible shipping options to customers. The Asset-Based segment’s careful cargo handling and use of technology, both internally to manage its business processes and externally to provide shipment visibility to its customers, are examples of how we add value to our services.
     Our ArcBest segment operates in a very competitive asset-light logistics market that includes approximately 17,000 active brokerage authorities, as well as asset-based truckload carriers and logistics companies, large expedite carriers including FedEx Custom Critical, Inc., smaller expedite carriers, foreign and U.S.-based non-vessel-operating common carriers, freight forwarders, internal shipping departments at companies that have substantial transportation requirements, smaller niche service providers, and a wide variety of solution providers, including large integrated transportation companies as well as regional warehouse and transportation management firms. ArcBest’s moving services compete with truck rental, self-move, and van line service providers, and a number of emerging self-move competitors who offer moving and storage container service. Quality of service, technological capabilities, and industry expertise are critical differentiators among the competition. In particular, companies with advanced systems that offer optimized shipping solutions, real-time visibility of shipments, verification of chain of custody procedures, and advanced security have significant operational advantages and create enhanced customer value. ArcBest’s performance in each of these areas of competitive distinction has enabled the segment to secure business and drive growth within our Asset-Light operations.
     FleetNet competes in the commercial vehicle maintenance and repair industry in two major sectors: emergency roadside and preventive maintenance. FleetNet competes directly against other third-party service providers, automotive fleet managers, leasing companies, and companies handling repairs in-house via individual service providers. While no one company encompasses all of FleetNet’s service offerings, competition is based primarily on providing maintenance solutions services. In partnership with best-in-class third-party vendors, FleetNet offers flexible, customized solutions and utilizes technology to provide valuable information and data to minimize fleet downtime, reduce maintenance events, and lower total maintenance costs for its customers.
     Pricing
 Approximately one third of our Asset-Based business is subject to base LTL tariffs, which are affected by general rate increases, combined with individually negotiated discounts. Rates on the other two thirds of our Asset-Based business, including business priced in the spot market, are subject to individual pricing arrangements that are negotiated at various times throughout the year. The majority of the business that is subject to negotiated pricing arrangements is associated with larger customer accounts with annually negotiated pricing arrangements, and the remaining business is priced on an individual shipment basis considering each shipment’s unique profile, the value we provide to the customer, and current market conditions. 

 
  9

 

     Effective August 1, 2017, we began applying space-based pricing on shipments subject to LTL tariffs to better reflect freight shipping trends that have evolved over the last several years. These trends include the overall growth and ongoing profile shift of bulkier shipments across the entire supply chain, the acceleration in e-commerce, and the unique requirements of many shipping and logistics solutions. An increasing percentage of freight is taking up more space in trailers without a corresponding increase in weight. Space-based pricing involves the use of freight dimensions (length, width, and height) to determine applicable cubic minimum charges (“CMC”) that supplement weight-based metrics when appropriate. Traditional LTL pricing is generally weight-based, while our linehaul costs are generally space-based (i.e., costs are impacted by the volume of space required for each shipment). We believe space-based pricing better aligns our pricing mechanisms with the metrics which affect our resources and, therefore, our costs to provide logistics services. We seek to provide logistics solutions to our customers’ businesses and the unique shipment characteristics of their various products and commodities, and we believe that we are particularly experienced in handling complicated freight. The CMC is an additional pricing mechanism to better capture the value we provide in transporting these shipments. 
     Our Asset-Based and certain operations within our ArcBest segment assess a fuel surcharge based on the index of national on-highway average diesel fuel prices published weekly by the U.S. Department of Energy. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer. 
     Industry Factors
 According to management’s estimates and market studies by Armstrong & Associates, Inc. and the U.S. Department of Commerce, the total market potential in the industry segments we serve is approximately $305 billion, with $41 billion of potential revenue in the LTL market segment, $221 billion potential in the markets served by our ArcBest segment, and $43 billion in the maintenance and repair market served by our FleetNet segment. The LTL industry has significant barriers to entry and is highly competitive, as previously discussed in “Asset-Based Segment” within this Business section. Based on 2018 revenues, our Asset-Light operations represents a minor portion of the total market, which evidences the significant growth opportunity for us in the outsourced logistics market. More sophisticated supply chain practices are required as supply chains expand and become more complex, product and service needs continue to evolve, and companies look for solutions to their logistics challenges as well as for lower cost supply chain alternatives. Regulation in the transportation industry, as further discussed below, will continue to impair the competitiveness of smaller carriers in the logistics market, which may lead to tighter capacity or consolidation within certain sectors of the logistics market. In addition, disruptions from unexpected events such as natural disasters have resulted in further utilization of expedited shipping and premium logistics services and have caused companies to focus on risk management of their supply chains. 
     Various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non‑vessel‑operating common carriers, operations of ocean freight forwarders and ocean transportation intermediaries, safety, contract compliance, insurance and bonding requirements, tariff and trade policies, customs, import and export, employment practices, licensing and registration, taxation, environmental matters, data privacy and security, and financial reporting. The trucking industry faces rising costs, including costs of compliance with government regulations on safety, equipment design and maintenance, driver utilization, and fuel economy, and rising costs in certain non-industry specific areas, including health care and retirement benefits. 
     We are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations and are required to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits, some of which are difficult to obtain. The ArcBest segment’s network of third-party contract carriers must also comply with industry regulations, including the mandate of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”) for interstate commercial trucks to have electronic logging devices (“ELDs”) installed to monitor compliance with hours‑of‑service regulations, and other regulations such as the safety and fitness regulations of the Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), including requirements related to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. Any future modifications to these rules and other regulations impacting the transportation industry may impact our operating practices and costs.
     Seasonality
     Our operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage, shipment levels, and demand for our services and, consequently, revenues and operating results. Freight shipments and operating costs of our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The second and third calendar quarters of each year 

 
  10

 
usually have the highest tonnage levels, while the first quarter generally has the lowest, although other factors, including the state of the U.S. and global economies, may influence quarterly freight tonnage levels. 
     Shipments of the ArcBest segment may decline during winter months because of post-holiday slowdowns, but expedite shipments can be subject to short-term increases depending on the impact of weather disruptions to customers’ supply chains. Plant shutdowns during summer months may affect shipments for automotive and manufacturing customers of the ArcBest segment, but severe weather events can result in higher demand for expedite services. Moving services of the ArcBest segment are impacted by seasonal fluctuations, generally resulting in higher business levels in the second and third quarters as the demand for moving services is typically stronger in the summer months.
     Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are favorably impacted by extreme weather conditions that affect commercial vehicle operations, and the segment’s results of operations will be influenced by seasonal variations in service event volume.
     Technology
     Our advancements in technology are important to customer service and provide a competitive advantage. We continue to make investments in technology and innovations, including investments for improving the delivery of services to our customers and investments in comprehensive transportation and logistics services across ArcBest. The majority of the applications of information technology we use have been developed internally by our ArcBest Technologies subsidiary and tailored specifically for customer or internal business processing needs. ArcBest Technologies has made technology investments in a variety of areas to improve our customer experience and also optimize costs in our operating segments. In the Asset-Based segment, we are using enhanced tools such as barcoding, tablets, and scanning equipment to improve city pick-up and delivery productivity. In the ArcBest segment, we are using common quoting systems and predictive analytics tools which are undergoing continuous development and require ongoing investment.
     We make information readily accessible to our customers through various electronic pricing, billing, and tracking services, including mobile-responsive websites which allow customers to access information about their shipments, request shipment pickup, and utilize a variety of other digital tools. Online functions tailored to the services requested by customers include bill of lading generation, pickup planning, customer-specific price quotations, proactive tracking, customized e‑mail notification, logistics reporting, dynamic rerouting, and extensible markup language (XML) connectivity. This technology allows customers to incorporate data from our systems directly into their own website or backend information systems using electronic data interchange (“EDI”) standards as well as secure application programming interfaces (API). As a result, our customers can provide shipping information and support directly to their own customers.
     Expedite freight transportation customers of the ArcBest segment communicate their freight needs, typically on a shipment-by-shipment basis, by means of telephone, email, internet, mobile applications, or EDI. The information about each shipment is entered into a proprietary operating system which facilitates selection of a contracted carrier or carriers based on the carrier’s service capability, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. Once the carrier is selected, the cost for the transportation has been agreed upon, and the carrier has committed to provide the transportation, we are in contact with the carrier through numerous means of communication and utilize satellite tracking and communication units on the vehicles to continually update the position of equipment to meet customers’ requirements as well as to track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery. The satellite tracking and communication system automatically updates our fully-integrated internal software and provides customers with real-time electronic updates. 
     In 2018, ArcBest joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (“BiTA”). Founded in 2017, BiTA is a consortium of more than 250 freight transportation companies working to develop and set standards for the use of blockchain technology within the logistics and transportation industry. 
     Insurance, Safety, and Security
     Generally, claims exposure in the freight transportation and logistics industry consists of workers’ compensation, third-party casualty liability, and cargo loss and damage. We are effectively self-insured for $1.0 million of each workers’ compensation loss.  For each third-party casualty loss, we are generally self-insured for $1.0 million for our Asset-Based segment and $0.3 million for our Asset-Light operations. We are also self-insured for each cargo loss, up to a $0.3 million deductible for our Asset-Based segment and a $0.1 million deductible for our ArcBest segment. We maintain insurance that we believe is adequate to cover losses in excess of such self-insured amounts or deductibles. However, we cannot

provide assurance that our insurance coverage will provide adequate protection under all circumstances or against all potential losses. We have experienced situations where excess insurance carriers have become insolvent. We pay assessments and fees to state guaranty funds in states where we have workers’ compensation self-insurance authority. In some of these states, depending on the specific state’s rules, the guaranty funds may pay excess claims if the insurer cannot pay due to insolvency. However, there can be no certainty of the solvency of individual state guaranty funds. 
     We have been able to obtain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage for 2019 and are not aware of any matters which would significantly impair our ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at market rates for our operations in the foreseeable future. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims, or workers’ compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on our cost of insurance and results of operations.
     As evidenced by being an eight-time winner of the American Trucking Associations’ Excellence in Security Award, a seven-time winner of the President’s Trophy for Safety, and a seven-time winner of the Excellence in Claims & Loss Prevention Award, management believes its Asset-Based operations have one of the best safety records and one of the lowest cargo claims ratios in the LTL industry.
     Our operations are subject to cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) and regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. We are not able to accurately predict how past or future events will affect government regulations and the transportation industry. We believe that any additional security measures that may be required by future regulations could result in additional costs; however, other carriers would be similarly affected.
     Environmental and Other Government Regulations
     We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things: emissions control, transportation of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil.
     In August 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) jointly finalized a national program establishing a second phase of greenhouse gas emissions (“EPA/NHTSA Phase 2”), imposing new fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, such as those operated by our Asset-Based segment, for model years 2021-2027 and also instituting fuel efficiency improvement technology requirements for trailer model years 2018-2027. In October 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the portion of the EPA/NHTSA Phase 2 Final Rule regarding the trailer regulations, and the review of the Final Rule has an indefinite date of final ruling. In February 2018, the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”) approved plans to retain two provisions of the EPA/NHTSA Phase 2 Final Rule that would regulate glider kits and trailers. In the event the EPA does not enforce the trailer regulations of EPA/NHTSA Phase 2, certain other states may also individually enact legislation to enforce the regulations. A number of states have individually enacted, and California and certain other states may continue to enact, legislation relating to engine emissions, trailer regulations, fuel economy, and/or fuel formulation, such as regulations enacted by the CARB. At the present time, management believes that these regulations may not result in significant net additional overall costs should the technologies developed for tractors, as required in the EPA/NHTSA Phase 2 rulemaking, prove to be as cost-effective as forecasted by the EPA and the NHTSA. 
     In November 2018, the EPA launched the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative” (“CTI”) which includes plans for future rulemaking to reduce nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions.  According to the CTI announcement, the EPA plans to publish a new Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for tighter NOx emissions by 2020. One planned feature of the initiative is to coordinate emissions standards nationwide, which will prevent a further patchwork of state and local emissions regulations and should make compliance much easier for the industry. Since no details of implementation timeframe(s) nor target reductions of NOx emissions are yet released for CTI, it is difficult to assess the impact this future regulation may have.
     While fuel consumption and emissions may be reduced under the new standards, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could result in increases in these and other costs. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation beyond the currently enacted regulations, and there can be no assurance that more restrictive regulations than those previously described will not be enacted either federally or locally.

 Our Asset-Based operations store fuel for use in tractors and trucks in 62 underground tanks located in 18 states. Maintenance of such tanks is regulated at the federal and, in most cases, state levels. Management believes we are in substantial compliance with all such regulations. The underground storage tanks are required to have leak detection systems, and we are not aware of any leaks from such tanks that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
     Certain of our Asset-Based service center facilities operate with non-discharge certifications or stormwater permits under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”). The stormwater permits require periodic monitoring and reporting of stormwater sampling results and establish maximum levels of certain contaminants that may be contained in such samples. 
     We have received notices from the EPA and others that we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or other federal or state environmental statutes, at several hazardous waste sites. After investigating our subsidiaries’ involvement in waste disposal or waste generation at such sites, we have either agreed to de minimis settlements or determined that our obligations, other than those specifically accrued with respect to such sites, would involve immaterial monetary liability, although there can be no assurance in this regard. It is anticipated that the resolution of our environmental matters could take place over several years. Our reserves for environmental cleanup costs are estimated based on management’s experience with similar environmental matters and on testing performed at certain sites.

     We are actively involved in efforts to promote a cleaner environment by reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. For many years, our Asset-Based segment has voluntarily limited the maximum speed of its trucks, which reduces fuel consumption and emissions and contributes to ABF Freight’s excellent safety record. Our Asset-Based segment utilizes engine idle management programming to automatically shut down engines of parked tractors. Fuel consumption and emissions have also been minimized through a strict equipment maintenance schedule. In 2015, our Asset-Based segment began voluntarily installing aerodynamic aids on its fleet of over-the-road trailers to further enhance fuel economy and reduce emissions. ABF Freight participates in the EPA’s SmartWay Transport Partnership, a collaboration between the EPA and the freight transportation industry that helps freight shippers, carriers, and logistics companies reduce greenhouse gases and diesel emissions.
